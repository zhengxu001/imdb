years ago, when darling lili played on tv, it was always the pan and scan version, which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews/blake edwards opus, i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.boy, what a terrible film. it's so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals (mary poppins, sound of music, thoroughly modern millie, etc) but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself (camelot, my fair lady, etc) because hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. so blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. darling lili suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.mind you, the version on the dvd is the "director's cut", or in this case, "let's salvage whatever we can" from this notorious box office flop. in releasing the dvd, edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. the film moves along with no idea of what it is. we are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. what kind of spy is lili? how powerful is she? was she ever responsible for someone's death? instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews. things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. why does julie fall for hudson? why him and not other men she got involved with? there should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. there's no catalyst in this story.one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews' (and edwards') previous successes. the best (or worst) example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. edwards channeling sound of music. it's no wonder he removed it from the dvd. back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews/edwards other films. the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie. the musical moment "i'll give you three guesses" was created just to make fun of julie's mary poppins persona, which is turned "raunchy" with julie doing a striptease in the act. the ending, bird's eye view of julie running towards hudson's plane, is another "wink" at sound of music.the whole thing is confusing. julie plays a singer, born from a german father and british mother, who lives in england but sings her (english) songs in paris. you never know exactly where the story takes place. some moments are just badly edited. like when julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. i'm like "what happened here?"the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. every scene with the french police are pathetic. where's peter sellers when you really need him. the action is stupid beyond belief. when julie and her "uncle" are on their way to germany on that train, hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing lili in the process. brilliant. what's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. that's one slow moving train there. the musical moments. the beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason i gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too? the "girl in no man's land" is ok even if it's bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?the whole project is listless and without energy. the romance is 100% unbelievable. rock hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). julie looks dazed, like she's on valium. but what really kills this ill-conceived project is julie playing a german spy. edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. as much as i like julie, she's no greta garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari. funny enough, even if julie plays a german spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.how bad is darling lili? even after 37 years since its release, blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release.

even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a "forbidden" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking jackie coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding. finally, more killings--but nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. if you want to see the kids butchered, opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the 13th over this

foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. the victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by don peake. still, it's business as usual for dead-camper movies.there are much better films in this vein, but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die-hard slasher fans. although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn (1981), wrong turn (2003), or even the final terror (1983) again.* 1/2 out of ****

rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room.leprechaun 4, jack frost and the prey.i picked up jack and lep 4 because they are well known bad movies i have never seen.i picked this movie out because it matched the "how to find a bad movie" guide on badmovies.org, no real description, no pics of the movie on the back, and i had never heard of it, had to be a winner :)(spoilers, but this movie is so awful it doesn't matter :p)this is a true bad movie, lep 4 and jack frost are dumb on purpose, this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew.this "movie" starts out much like evil dead, even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress. unlike evil dead it never gains any speed at all. for a "slasher" movie it is pretty bland, in 80 minutes 6 people get killed, but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring.the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting, obviously to go along with the whole "prey" theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring. the gore is horrible. all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story.the last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion, yet another way to add length to this. the "climax" is such a total joke, its hard to laugh at it is so bad. the back of the box says "the ending will shock and haunt you." yes it will, it will shock you that someone could put such a bad "plot twist" on film and "haunt" you because you won't believe you paid to watch this crap.also the tagline is "its not human, and it's got an axe!" one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen.a true 1 out of 10. i love laughing at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities. no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick :p

the prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of 1984 you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. the plot is your basic killer in the woods again. but ironically this was filmed before friday the 13th. the prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. but released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes jim, namans drive in showed this in june of 84). but it has a dated look to it. maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984. now on the story, it has some kind of back story, a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death. but one of their children survive (our monster) so flash forward to present day which would be 1978, we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster. the tag line for this picture claims its not human, and its got an axe, but an axe was only used in these first two killings. now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20's camping. we all know they are the prey, and the monster knocks them of one by one. for an 80 minute movie it seems longer. we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins. overall for being out into an 80-'s horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever. hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short.. it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him. side note, the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the 1990's..

all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! it is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. a couple exchanging nods over their "good grub." a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline). the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there's talk of people burned in a fire. lots of seemingly stock-footage close-up shots of animals, birds, insects, and spiders in the woods.the movie starts with a forest fire, then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe. the killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole, and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands.if it's true that the movie in the version available on the out-of-print videotape is cut, perhaps if there's a lot of footage that was cut, it deserves another look on dvd. otherwise, it's simply not very interesting, and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors-slasher fan.

i walked into a book store in brentwood, tennessee. i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer. i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one. on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting. (might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in.) i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. i was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. i had great expectations for it. i couldn't believe what i seen when i viewed it. it didn't look like a real movie. it looked like a home video. i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie. i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know. this is no horror movie. you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie. i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along. i swear i did. it never did get any better. there were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him. i didn't find that entertaining at all. i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me. i guess that is how bad this economy has got. i have this to say to the cast and crew. do not show this film as material to get other film jobs. don't do it. i mean that sincerely. i commend you for trying. for people who have bought this. i say this. don't sell your copy to someone. they could get very upset. have a nice day everyone.

thank god i didn't buy this movie myself! i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! this has got to be one of the worse movies i've ever seen! i do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets! the acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, everything! it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it! i'm looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don't have to stoop to watch this joke!

i saw this movie with my girlfriend. it was a total disaster. you can really see it was cheaply made. badly scripted and with very bad acting. i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. we couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green acres. then there were parts that were vulgar. they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it. the witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs. i thought it was nasty and very strange. i really can't understand why someone would think that would be entertaining. it shows another scene where dr. mize arrives and betsy bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers. instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother. how sick? the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects. i think they should have left all of that out. the makeup on the reverend james johnston as a older man didn't really make you assume he was older. it made you think he was dipped in fish batter. the blood on joshua gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse. the john bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man. to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture. these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products. they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner. i rate this film capital f minus.

if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. this film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. i wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. it is a low budget movie with amateur actors. it looks like it was filmed for a film contest. the acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a hee haw script writer. my family laughed at it. a grade zzzzzzzzzzzzz all the way. you won't be scared by this one. here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film. when the guy gets his toe stomped by ric white's stupid portrayal of the reverend james johnston walking cane. the guys reactions are like if he had an amputation with no pain killer. watch the dvd extras after you watch the movie. when you see ric white and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts. how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck. don't get fooled like we did and buy this failure.

are you kidding me? this is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie i've ever seen. the casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and i'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing drew around was nothing more than comical. when i herd about the bell witch, i wanted to believe. i read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. but this movie just destroyed that. ric white (director, writer, lead actor, etc) takes himself a bit too seriously and i think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves....do yourself a favor....skip this one.

in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything "real" about this legend need to grow up. this is the 21st century. guess what: ghosts don't exist. most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. you guys seriously need to grow up.the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesn't do it either. go to college. or at least finish high school.

i wanted to like this movie. i really, really did. i was so excited when i saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. but when i saw the actual film, i was disappointed. the acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced. and i'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. i grew up on the bell witch legend, so i know quite a bit about it. a lot of facts in the movie are right on target, but this film should have been much better. the entire birthday party scene, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or the story, and should have been left on the cutting room floor. a more heavy-handed editor might have been able to get a decent film out of this mess.please understand, i'm not in any way, shape or form involved with the other bell witch movie, and i'm not trying to "attack" this imdb listing. i'm just telling it like it is.

i am not understanding why people are praising this movie. i didn't like it at all. i watch it with several people. none of them cared for it either. first of all. it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. the actual filming looks like a live tv interview. the makeup is bad. when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras. you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. there is no talent. there are facts that do appear in the book. the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it. i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story. what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one. it has always fascinated me. the bad acting really ruined the story. the little boys situation really hammed it up even more. when you watch this movie. the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about. it didn't make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her. it is a whopping tale with him and his little problem. i can't still get over the little girl saying "mom said tobacco will rot your teeth." frank fox's statement and facial expression is so bad. the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to. the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho. also, the girl hovering over the bed and her little "bladder control problem" are from the exorcist. this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity. we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer. i also noticed that their was defects in the film quality. parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera. i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs. this is probably how this movie was put together. someone said i like this story. i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer. doesn't matter if we don't know how to act. as long as we get it on film and say it is good. we got the family together and prepared food. then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.

the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by richard williams bell (son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell) titled "our family trouble." to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line. if you must know the story, read about it, its much more gripping and conclusive.

bell witch haunting (aka the haunt) is an american horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.this is not to be confused with bell witch: the movie, a movie starring betsy palmer based on the same events. however, i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw! i enjoyed betsy palmer's chilling performance in friday the 13th. as such, i believe that even on a bad day, she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as the haunt.with regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. it is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.reading the positive reviews for this movie, i could only identify three possibilities. the first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. the second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. the final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.the setting for the plot is robertson county, tennessee. james johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the bell witch. the story is told as a series of flashbacks. a series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of john bell and his family. it soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.on the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. and then some!first, the acting. the acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. this factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. the voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines. unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! i may not have been alive in the 1800s, but i find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this "ghost" does!second, the direction. the direction is haphazard and very uneven. some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. the atmosphere is equally flat. a vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. i'll give one example. in one scene, the spirit attacks someone. see the scene for yourself. it's almost funny - almost.third, the script. whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. this movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. whilst this style was also the case with british movies from the british horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. peter cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. the same cannot be said of the actors in the haunt.finally, the humour. the ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. an obese boy is the butt of many jokes. one particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. this scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. the costumes were also well chosen.overall, the haunt is an appalling movie. it is not even in the "so bad it's good" league. it is instead just boring. i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. don't even bother seeing it for free!i have never seen the other movie about the bell witch. but it really couldn't be any worse than the haunt. could it? i'll give this other movie a chance if i can track it down.in the meantime, i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. the legend of hell house, the changeling, ringu, the grudge (japanese original) and one missed call (japanese original) are good places to start.

i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til it's end, even if i'm not really enjoying it. i rarely feel like i wasted my time... but, this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible! it wasn't scary in the least bit. what is with the comic relief moments? the dialog was tedious. acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open. (like the birthday party)the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done.i am curious about other adaptation, but until then, i will stick to reading about the story.

while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life. she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. if a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, i would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig. what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it.i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are. guys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all.some women may hate me for this, but i hope not. i have much respect for women. i was raised by one. i also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal. my grandmother was the center of my family for years, but i don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself, some women were offended by her project.

if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. painful to watch; i may have laughed once. the story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. the final reworked rendition of "the christmas story" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. and boy, a little eddie murphy goes a long way. with its desperate attempt to be hip and current, this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like "the grinch" will remain timeless. a sad waste of effort by all involved, a veritable "jumping of the shark" for the shrek franchise.

i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. he disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.we saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. it was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. if i wasn't on a bus i would have walked out on the movie. anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned.

this is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. it isn't. instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity. typical is the scene where peter (kelsey grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend adam (dwier brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. so deep. we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during adam's travels through the mojave desert on foot. (he abruptly leaves l.a. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) some characters are more entertaining than others. the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. the actor, james kevin ward, does some great impressions, including nicholson, popeye, and several characters from the original star trek. but once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound. it's a long trip, which drags in many places. in fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie i've ever seen. and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all.i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv. that'll learn me. next time i'll try harder to sleep in.

this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies i've ever seen. i'm seriously considering buying a copy, if i can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. it's honestly that bad. i view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. if you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. just to be fair, kelsey grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite. other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful, but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst, but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top, and the movie doesn't even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way. if you are familiar with the term "word vomit" then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity. oh, and the narrative structure is ill conceived, pretentious and amateurish. it has failed on both style and substance. if you really hate someone, invite them over for a double feature of this movie and "the terror of tiny town," an all midget western from the 1930's and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open "a clockwork orange" style. but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions.

the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is "graveyard of horrors," but i think that must be an error. it should have been called "graveyard of horribles." horrible acting, horrible editing, horrible story, and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard.horrible.

what if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot?well, i think it would probably end up a little bit like this one. i don't think i've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed (at the beginning) to complete crap (by the end). i only stuck with it, because i kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse. well, up until the very end, "necrophagus"/"graveyard of horror" proved me wrong.who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard-man, evil grave-robbing cultists, and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad? one would think there'd at least be some humor value... but not here.

from time to time it's very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world.and that's what happens in "the love light", the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter; better for her, certainly, because her career as a film director doesn't impress this german count.the film tells the story of dame angela carlotti ( dame mary pickford ) a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a "picturesque squalor" ( an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes; aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury" ); she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference. destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela's two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead. but destiny is even crueller and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with a german!! and to make things worse, she doesn't know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal, don't mean "ich liebe dich" but "sink any damn italian boat at sea"fortunately for dame angela, pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him ( a not strange fact, indeed, because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed ) but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians.from that german love, a half-teutonic baby will born ( the wicked destiny at full speed ) but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity.but meanwhile dame angela's secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela's sorrowful life will improve; a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind. but as they say in germany, it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people.as this german count said before, it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter, because as can be seen in "the love light", she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, ja wohl! but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces. the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances.and now, if you'll allow me, i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress.

i had to see this on the british airways plane. it was terribly bad acting and a dumb story. not even a kid would enjoy this. something to switch off if possible.

this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local itv station at 1.00 am a couple of nights ago . this might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but the real howard spitz is a rather strange film , strange in the way it doesn't want to upset its audience . come on there's nothing kids like more than sadism and that's why roald dahl was such a popular author for children . it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world . in this screenplay you're just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn't happen . i'm not advocating child abuse but to see howard spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better . can you imagine how much worse kindergarten cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc ? i mean if you're making a movie centered around a children's author who hates children shouldn't the story show and not tell ? much of the problem lies with director vadim jean and you do get the feeling he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie . as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden . i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he's famous for but it fails to work here and there's many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting . but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities

caution spoiler: at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. the impression is that the attack was all for nothing. in reality, taking the bridge at remagen was the last important victory for the western allies. it was the crossing of the rhine that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months. because the remagen bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured. this was enough time for the americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side, and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges. the taking of the bridge was a complete success, and meant the that the end of the war was near, and would not last through the summer. contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it. they knew how vital the battle was.this film has little to do with real history. it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.

the bridge at remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i've ever seen. aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. the constant suicidal behavior set off my "tilt switch" so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie. apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan. unless you are under 7 years old, i recommend watching something else.gb

veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column b of the harold robbins big book of plots. set against a smoggy phoenix skyline, post-charlies angles jaclyn smith takes a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times" while jfk impersonator james franciscus lounges around the fringes. mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.oh yeah, and bob mitchum is in there too. somewhere.

you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. it's just like hannah montana and that's so raven. next, the acting is just average. selena gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. if they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us "laugh", they are throwing various props around the room. i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material. in conclusion, wisards of waverly place is a disappointment.

if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris, more shallow than britney, more vapid than jessica and more narcissistic than the girls next door, wonder no more. the amazing thing is selena gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. she's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic "popular" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for hilary duff in lizzie mcguire. plots range from recycled bewitched & i dream of jeannie to "parodies" of harry potter. the older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces. the younger boy is just another of the smart-mouth "wisecracking" brats who have multiplied on tv like cockroaches in new york (and with the same appeal). the dad is the stereotypical dumb tv dad, and the mom... well, she's not totally awful. but all pales beside the hideous, loathsome, and yet horribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) spectacle of ms. lopez' smug, self-satisfied, snotty performance . and, again, she's the heroine.

i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. it is so boring. the jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. it's like, alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. my friend and i just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, "what's so funny?!!". seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. just a blank look. so we stop watching it. i am personally a fan of sitcoms, so i tried to watch the show. but the show us such a disappointment. this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever...

this is what disney channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. it suits them well. it's not funny, the acting is the worst i've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. wanna know why? not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead "actress" selena gomez looks like a pig. jake t. austin's character needs some ritalin. david henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted. also, the writer of the show is inconsistent. in one episode, the security guard is called "sir" by one character and referred to as a woman by all else. hello? it's called proofreading and editing. do it sometime, disney. has anyone seen the promo for the new "four part bloodsucking saga"? disney wanted their own version of the twilight vs. harry potter thing. except a million times lamer. the wizards of waverly place movie?? think about it for a minute. family goes away on vacation and 16 year old daughter wants independence from parents. same plot from the proud family movie etc...what's worse is all the emmies and alma's it got. and most of the audience are some-what age's 4-13 (and no life teenagers). how many more years? before selena gomez is showing her tits?and disney shows are all crap..hack writers..hack shows..destroying the minds and wallets of today's youth..

the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers. she has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. he's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: wood's jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick. she sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's classic padding between commercials. it also is one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman doing wood's singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery. also, keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses. by comparison, wagner looks relatively timeless, with close-cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits.

natalie wood portrays courtney patterson, a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair, with her partner being attorney marcus simon, played tepidly by wood's real-life husband, robert wagner. the film is cut heavily, but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently somnambulate, laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood, who also proffers a fine soprano. the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner's dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout, as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood, which must be discouraging to an actress. the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this, coupled with choppy editing, leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring, motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing. although largely undistinguished, the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and, following the sound of a closing door, remains at the center while the camera's eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty. more controlled direction would have allowed the performers, even the limp wagner, to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship; as it was released, there is, for the most part, an immense lack of commitment.

this show is made for persons with iq lower than 80. the jokes in the show are so lame. if you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage.... you will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform...it really pisses me of that viewers gave reba 6.7 on their voting...sure i knew there are some people with iq lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them! so people if you got to read this i hope that you will never ever download or buy this peace of garbage... i know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini-series 'scrubs'

while it would be easy and accurate to go into why 'reba' is at its heart indicative of many 'family-oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms, the real truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows, and the lead star is completely out of her element. while i'm sure ms. mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that, being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next lucille ball is far, far removed from reality.reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put-upon woman of which her entire family is centered. yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be mia. reba mcintire has no screen presence, and to make a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most 'family-oriented' programming: to push a sitcom full of men-stupid/women-do-everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable.the show is a waste of time. the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoff....just.

in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! however the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, i recognized the music as being a band called firstryke and the album was "just a nightmare" and it was very well written!! and i am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far i would appreciate the feed back, i collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks. it is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding. i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album. not to bad hugh?

now i've seen it all. just when i thought it couldn't get any more pathetic and cheesy than "woodchipper massacre," just when i thought dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than "nail gun massacre," just when i thought "don't go in the woods" would retain its title as lousiest slasher film ever, along comes "the last slumber party!" somehow, this cheap, wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness, but it remains terrible! i couldn't believe my eyes--for once i can't complain about excessive (or in this case, any) nudity in a slasher film, but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it. never before have i seen such horrible acting, dialect, direction, writing,....i could go on forever with this list! here's a quick run-down:a mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin, dresses up like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives, and breaks in while the doctor's daughter is having friends over for the night. then begins the most stupid killing spree (ripped off from other movies such as "slumber party massacre" and halloween") this side of the universe. the characters have negative iqs, which suggests they are not human. then again, i guess they are not, since they have the tendency to bleed kool-aid when they get cut, as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his scapel to the camera in way too many scenes. it is only 80 minutes...how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie?...which i suppose wouldn't be all that bad of an idea in this case! there is one moment where i thought maybe, just maybe, the director would make it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas! it was not to be! and then to insult even further, there is a stupid super cop-out sub-ending and an even stupider final conclusion. that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but i would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools (like me) dumb enough to rent this sewage.i sure hope that, by writing this, i have saved 80 minutes of someone's life. i get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this: please, please, please don't! this is a fan of the slasher genre talking; i know what is good for you! the only real victims in this rattlebrained, asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank! zanatos's score...since there is no negative point scale, i have to give it a 1, but a below-average 1 at that. avoid it at all costs....please!!!!

i would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen. it's not just the actors that are bad, but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time. anyone that likes this must be crazy! this movie is a waste of time

i thought godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity. my friends and i went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. we could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. we decided to look in the low budget horror section. we looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. we finally decided on last slumber party, the. whoops, we made a mistake. it seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in k-mart. the actors were picked up at a salvation army, and as for steven tyler. we will just leave that to the imagination. the plot of this movie was ridiculous. spoiler alert while watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all. then come to find out all the events were just a dream. this movie should also have been about 30 minutes. if all the camera zooms on still shots, and scans of walls were taken out, it would have been much shorter. all i can say is i'm glad there wasnt a sequel.

so one day i was in the video store looking for a movie. i came across this and rented it because it was a film i hadn't seen or even heard of.now i like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction i have ever come across. now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. painful example of home-made horror.

i love cheesy horror movies, i think dead alive and bad taste are great and i think slumber party massacre ii (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. but this movie absolutely stank, i didn't laugh, i didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. the best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? give me a break.don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series. it's awful and i don't even have a clue how it got any distribution. rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone else the favor.

i'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. however, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone. we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. we can only assume he had a charlie's angels fixation at one time. based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie's angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what i've read here it was made around 1987. you sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values. it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class. and while by no means would i expect a low-budget trash fest like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other. even so i'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made, second only to "nail gun massacre."

i got this on a double feature dvd called "scream theater" and it's no doubt one of the most terrible movies i've ever seen. and i've seen some really bad ones. school's out, and of three girls (who if they're teenagers i'd eat my hat) are talking about "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party. meanwhile, a psychotic has escaped the local bug-house where one girl's father works & is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs, and sporting wide-open eyes...i guess that's to show he's bonkers. of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house, the location of which is apparently common knowledge. in the meantime, some dumb-jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls, and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats. and that's about it, as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background. or, maybe that's not it, but really, that's all you need to know. unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk, you'll find little of interest here, and even if you are wasted most of the time, you'll still probably find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10.

my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago. and, i must say, this is the single best movie i have ever seen. i mean, woah! "dude, we better get some brew before this joint closes" and "dude, linda's not wearin' a bra again." what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderfuly original movie, too. i mean, you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same. i mean, exactly! now that's originality. and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close-ups of the psycho in the er scrubs. how cool! the acting is so wonderful to. the dad was just brilliant. must have studied real dads before filming. and how many movies do you find that just don't make any sense? not many. but this is one of those gems. i mean, how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank, while his friends were both inside? that's really cool. overall i'd say this is the single greatest film of the genre, nay, in the world! *****

o boy, was this really bad.i saw this on videotape.in scenes that had soundtrack music, it was hard to hear the dialog. when people were on the telephone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. it appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used, because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. and there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.one indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on tv. there is just a "news flash" title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a tv screen, and a voice-over by a newscaster. they couldn't shoot footage of a newscaster, and then actually show it on the tv?the movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask, wielding a scalpel. supposedly he's a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him.students are let out of school for a break, and three young women decide to have a slumber party. three guys decide to crash the party, and a geek named science decides to crash it too. the slumber party is pretty boring, and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks, taking the masks off, and then disappearing. the mother and father (the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls keep showing up too. the killer knocks slices people's throats without anyone really noticing. the apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie. perhaps that was bad acting, or maybe it was intentional, since much of the movie is a nightmare, and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare.the ending is really horrible too.the best thing about the movie is the cheesy united home video vhs box art, which was revived for the dvd release (a double feature with terror at tenkiller). i honestly can't tell if it is a photo, or a painting, or a combination of both. the women pictured on the cover are not in the movie, and the clothing they're wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore. the throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie - where people tend to affect a goofy pop-eyed look. for that matter, that's what the killer has most of the time: head cocked, and eyes bugging out, mugging for the camera. frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus, while the killer's mask-covered face was in close-up but out of focus in the background.

i had seen this movie when i was a boy (before wwii) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. this is an example of a movie that was not a "a" movie. no editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. should not even be as high as a "b" had a laugh at how jaded i've become over the years. seems to me i thought it was good when i originally saw it.

most of wayne's b westerns are kind of fun in a naive way, but this one really stinks. the editing is terrible, and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic. most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper, and i was bored. sorry, duke, but this gets a 1.

there were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. randy bowers (john wayne) stopping at a 'halfway house' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing "the loveliest night of the year." it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang, to get ed rogers' $30,000. randy is an investigator who "works alone," who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping (with ed's daughter sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. it all moves along fairly quickly. only one too many chases after randy slow it down.we even get george hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- marvin black, the vilest villain, as well as the good citizen, matt the mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally, "ah, i'm fed up with this!" you can find george playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial "the lost city" (1934).i think this is the only 'lone star' film in which the title relates to, or is mentioned in the film! sally offers her hand to randy and says, "he's not alone anymore!" then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. sally's running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff.not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. i'd really give it a 4 and a half.

john wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. his career stretched over forty years, and within that time he starred in films such as "angel and the badman", "the green berets", "sands of iwo jima", "rio bravo", "north to alaska", and "the undefeated".the film's listed above are hailed as some of his best, unlike this 1934 effort "randy rides alone", which has been pretty much forgotten about as time's gone on, which is unsurprising, as it's nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutes.a young john wayne plays randy bowers, who for reasons never really explained, arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. while looking around, a posse arrives and finds randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is. he is put in jail accused of the murders. sally rogers, whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered, arrives at the jail to see randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members ( she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place ). sally doesn't believe that randy is a killer, and doesn't recognise him, so while the sheriff is out, she slips him the keys and randy escapes. while running away from the sheriff and his posse, randy conveniently stumbles into the gang's hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders. randy sets out to clear his name, and also to bring the gang to justice."randy rides alone" can be a fun film to watch, especially if you're a john wayne fan. but at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore. the film is also extremely dated, as you would expect; we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is terrible. the acting isn't great either, and wayne's character is very wooden and he, along with the rest of the cast, look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone ( in this case it's by director harry fraser ). harry fraser is at the helm, and does a good enough job but the story is paper-thin. one can't help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone. an explanation on why randy was there is giving later on, which turns out to be something like he is a p.i who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town. to be honest i didn't really pick it up, most of the time i was hoping for the movie to end.but that being said, i didn't find this film to be completely terrible. i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times. but it really isn't a great film, and isn't really worth watching or tracking down.overall, "randy rides alone" is incredibly dated and is a tiresome western with very few redeeming qualities. can be fun but overall it isn't a great movie and is certainly one of wayne's weaker outings.

randy bowers (john wayne) comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail, and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside, among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - ed rogers, proprietor of the establishment. he's observed by the dead man's niece sally (alberta vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where she remained unobserved during the carnage."randy rides alone" was directed by harry fraser. he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he fast forwards the action from one location to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. it's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era lone star westerns.pre-gabby george hayes is on hand, sans whiskers, and this is the first time i've seen him as a villain. in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role, first as hunchbacked businessman "matt the mute", communicating via pencil and paper, only to turn into marvin black, leader of a gang of outlaws. black's gang was responsible for the murders at half way house, in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt/marvin. another staple player is here as well, yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike. interestingly, yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser/wayne oater, "neath the arizona skies".there's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between black's gang and the sheriff's posse, as john wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. in the end, he saves the day by securing sally rogers' thirty thousand dollars, at the expense of destroying the half way house, where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain. in his best "aw shucks" attitude, john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers, and alas, randy rides alone no more!

watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. john wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. all he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. that's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old english murder mysteries.the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. not something you see in westerns, but a good gimmick.unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly. but this was a b western and not even a good one at that.gabby hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby.if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film.

this review is for the uk dvd three-disc box set. disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior, chasing jamie and fast and curious. disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special, falling in lust again and love potion no. 10. the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom, she's the boss and legally yours. why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe (lauren hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. for instance, model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; she's the boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. finally, the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel, singer island, florida although my map of florida shows no singer island. the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned. this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release. 4 stars.

it´s long time that i and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. it´s definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series. there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. we gave 4/10.

two years after this movie was made, "the juror" came out. don't waste your time on this one. see "the juror" instead. "the juror" is essentially the same story as "trial by jury," with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. william hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and armand assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. you didn't become involved enough with joann whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her. also, the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way. kathleen quinlan's role as a hooker/killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot.

a antique shop-owner in nyc, played by joanne whalley(valerie alston)gets put on a us district court jury, on a trial of a known mafioso armand asante(rusty pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of pirone attempting to get whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with willam hurt as the go-between. much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds hurt and asante's obsession with whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable. 3/10 is probably going easy on this waste of time.

this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. and believe me, i have seen a lot of movies. the unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad "alien lifeforms inhabit earth" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an archchristian "judgement day is at hand, seek jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. even religious christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this. i didn't know what to do with myself when i watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by 7-year-olds. simply disgusting. i am not a christian nor very religious. but if i had been, i would no longer be afraid of hell. rich christiano has shown be something much, much worse.

this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda. it started off like a good sci-fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated. i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it. the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god.the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable, writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all, this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided.there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject. if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels , you will love this movie.

this movie starts really good.after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap.some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ - or you go to hell.don't watch it - it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...this movie starts really good.after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap.some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ - or you go to hell.don't watch it - it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...

my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. from the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st. james was in the film, realized it was a christian movie, and suggested we watch it. we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "christian" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.to be fair, there were a few things i liked about the film. the musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. the film begins with an interesting premise - ufo abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture. at least the frank peretti-inspired "the visitation" (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise. "unidentified" ends nowhere even close to where it started, which is a huge letdown.as for the acting? the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (rebecca st. james plays a bit part and is passable.) for their part, a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. sadly, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. the "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying.a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of more interest to christian than non-christian readers. in a word, it is embarrassing. other christian films like carmen's "the champion" and peretti's "the hangman's curse" have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. this film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.i do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and i applaud efforts to create good christian film. unfortunately, this is not one of them. if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film, consider "mercy streets," the aforementioned "the champion," or (if you're pentecostal) robert duvall's provocative "the apostle." as for "unidentified?" rent it if you must, but screen it before you show it to a non-christian or a larger audience.

first of all, i have nothing against christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! what a waste of believers' money. they'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. i don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this "movie", because i couldn't find any of those in this. story's simple - two reporters, one (a) is atheist, the other (b) for some sake has abandoned religion. b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson - believe in christ or go to hell. this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie. people, do not believe the rating of this "movie", read reviews first. i didn't and wasted an hour of my life :( ps: why is it classified as sci-fi? because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky? pps: u.f.o. = satan's evil doings? that's a new one :)

supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense. it's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos, one i've heard before. this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. the paranormal? it's real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a christian context, then of course, it is of god. simple, if it isn't of god, it's the of the devil, stupid! so i suppose since beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by god, it must have been written under demonic influence. or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe, therefore there is none (a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy) and that god created the universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. i think of carl sagan's remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space.so what are ufos? they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event, the rupture...i mean rapture. before the tribulation, the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. all part of satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist.this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.it's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or satan or some such.this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to free rock concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan's ballgame. but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam, the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity, as islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism. although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascal's wager. the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you're wrong?basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy. even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default, nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.for all we know, native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better.this movie should be stamped right on the box: caution: contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.

this movie was terrible. it is not something that people should have to pay to see. it looks like some christian group made it to convert people. i don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv.it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about "god" and "do you believe in jesus?" it quickly moves into pure religion territory.i thought i was going to a sci-fi movie. the film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.avoid it!

calling this a "sunday school" movie might be generous, because, even as a christian, i found the religious message so one-dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church. the message is, "read your bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you won't get left behind at the rapture." there was no love. i guess when you get right down to it, i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film. the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula.aside from the spiritual/religious element, the script was tedious--saying the same thing over and over. that might have been to make up for some of the acting, which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over.i did enjoy the final scenes. i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a sunday school formula. the movie wasn't all bad, just most of it.i am in favor of more clean movies that are well-done and that present truth in a non-preachy way. this wasn't one of those, i am sorry to say. i took my family to this film, wanting to support that kind of movie. now i'd like my money back.

unfortunately, i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango. since i am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested me.instead, this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick. appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. shame on you! at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness.so, this b-grade movie (and i am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups. but if you are a mainline christian or non-christian you will not be comfortable.

a thinly veiled attempt to push hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. what could be worse than hogan in the movies? bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as tiny lester made his way to the wwe that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. see the dictionary under oops. as a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when i came out i immediately checked into h.a. - hulkamaniacs annoynimous. i am proud to say i have been off the hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since. since this was made to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the wwe in hogans hey day one has to wonder if there weren't more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did, such as huffing gas or russian roulette.

no holds barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger. but then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it. you feel cheated, embarrassed, and stupid. if you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it's gay, give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday.

i remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. they showed clips every week on wwf tv and everyone was excited. it debuted opening weekend at number two behind indiana jones and the last crusade. then it did a nosedive. critics hated this film. i don't remember seeing one good review. everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. i didn't know they meant back then but now i do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol. when i was younger, i didnt care for that. it was hulkamania, brother!!!now i find this pretty bad, but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with bodyslam (which has a better storyline). first off, hulk hogan's acting skills just aren't great. he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring. and actually, rip and hulk are not to far off from each other. kurt fuller is a good actor, but he is not good at playing the bad guy. he is better at comedy and nervous drama characters. he is just not believable as brell. there isn't much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of randy, rip's brother and charlie the trainer (in wrestling its unheard of a trainer escourting a wrestler to the ring lol). tiny lister plays zeus the way its supposed to be played, so there isnt any problem there. joan severence is passable and for all you softcore hounds, she does have a lingerie scene lol. by the end, you figure, what's the point?for this one (as with other wrestling films or films that feature wrestlers as the main star), turn your brain off. you'll enjoy it more if you do.

i worked on this atrocity ten years ago. luckily for me, no one knows it because i didn't make the final cut. and when i saw the movie in the theaters, i was glad! my agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. they later told me that, once back in california (we shot in atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be. i found hulk hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise -- what a waste of film!

no holds barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously. it sucks hardcore as a serious movie. look at it more in the way that you should plan 9 from outer space. they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny. the funny moments in no holds barred are usually the ones that aren't supposed to be. when rip (played by hulk hogan as only he can play them) grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with brell (kurt fuller) hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see. it might be the funniest scene ever, i swear.anyway, how someone thought this movie would make money i'll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission. i hope they at least got fired. this movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts.

ignoring rocky 3, this is easily hulk hogan's best film, and it still rates as one of the worst films ever. hulk hogan essentially plays hulk hogan, bringing his wrestling buddies in for a film, with all the cliches to go along with it - the crooked promoter, the unstoppable monster, the injured kid, the sexy woman and... "dookie".

in 1989 here in nz wrestling was somewhat of a mega-hype phenom, and who was steering starship at the pinnacle was the orange goblin himself, hulk hogan (one of my uber-heroes at this time), so it seems obvious to me now why i adored this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. hulk hogan a.k.a terry bollea is a shockingly bad actor and zeus a.k.a tiny lister is worse!!! the story line follows a standard wwe (then wwf) circa 88-91 story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down, hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength( gained from eating vitamins, saying prayers etc etc ) to mount the epic come back..... pretty standard formula here. worth watching if only for reminiscing your youth!!!!

being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (backyard dogs, bodyslam, jesse ventura story) but this one isn't the worst i've ever seen. yes its bad but its better than some of the others i've mentioned.hulk hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture usa network having rip...and tnt will go to any lengths to get him.does this make sense...no? well don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a real fight with rip at the end of the movie.none of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later hogan films its not so bad.4 out of 10

hulk hogan stars as a champion wrestler (a real acting stretch...) named rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (because wrestling sells!) however when rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) "battle of the tough guys" who's champion zeus (played by tiny lister jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital. no holds barred is pretty much what i expected from vince mcmahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre (hogan) it is basically lots of unintentional humor, tons of awkward sequences, a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity. in other words it's not unlike wrestling itself, so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they're getting. the movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this. i myself found this to be ultimately hilarious. they're are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself. (such as the way hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limo, how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way hogan recites from his cuecard. (i.e:"i'm not going to be around when this check clears!") no holds barred is a lot of fun, true, though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker.* * out of 4-(fair)

a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant zeus. network president brell does everything in his power to draw wwf champion rip into the squared circle to face off against zeus for the championship of the 'battle of the tough guys'. but zeus is unlike any competitor rip has ever faced.normally i would give hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably. 'tiny' lister made a good effort as the mighty zeus, but even his work left the film lacking something, namely acting!watch this movie, if you so desire, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in.

mind you, it's not supposed to be, but it is. as a wee tot, i watched this movie in the theatre (being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan). all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that i didn't really like it very much. i blacked the rest out, and for good reason.a poor film on par with the greats like "gymkata" and "the pumaman," "no holds barred" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling. well maybe the stakes aren't all that high...and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people "professionals" at anything. and really, except for the first scene, there's no wrestling to speak of. so i guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating-the-c***-out-of-people. sounds good, right?hulk hogan plays rip, the champion of the wwf (never let it be said that hulk hogan was typecast, this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents). essentially he's playing himself, but with a wardrobe that's more black and blue than the hulkster's red and yellow. he also has this hand gesture he does. it's kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts, except you stick your thumb in the air, and you curl your index finger in. my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an "r." try and see for yourself. if that looks like an "r," well, then, mars needs women. but anyway.kurt fuller, with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz, plays a tv exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting rip, who's evidentally bigger than elvis, on his network. he won't have any of it (and exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera), and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip. he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled "battle of the tough guys." marketing genius, this guy.from the numerous hand gestures, to the rather idiotic fight scenes (all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious) to the overacting, to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but undies, this movie has everything you'd ever want in a dumb movie. it's frivolous, not too taxing on the mind, violent, and includes the phrase "what's that smell?" "dookie!" "dookie?"a classic for all time.

i really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. the acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed wood's actors appear life like. "sammy," the lone black character, must be mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character. his old man make up in her other turkey ("pushed to the limit") is no-budget, junior high school quality, with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair.i cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video, unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand. it really is beyond fear-- it's actually beyond funny.

alert: this review contains major spoilers. do not read on if you plan to see this film.judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who mimi lesseos is. well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. an all-woman's federation called the ladies professional wrestling association opened. it was a great league, and mimi lesseos was one of the names on the roster. i always thought she was one of the best people the lpwa had in terms of ring skill and acting ability. unfortunately, the lpwa closed down in the early 90s, so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as mimi to start an acting career, right? but surely there was an alternative to stuff like this? this movie is really bad. as it was going along, i kept comparing it to an underrated movie called `survivor quest,' only this film lacks everything that made `survivor quest' enjoyable.as i started the tape, i went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape. at first, i wasn't paying much attention, but then i realized that the preview was for a movie starring mimi lesseos. `oh,' i thought, `here's another movie featuring mimi to look for.' but as the preview dragged on, i became aware that is was a preview for.'beyond fear!' you know you're in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch! the plot of this thing is pretty standard. lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponent/friend, so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend sammy: being a wilderness guide. on this particular occasion, she gets a troop of three couples. two of the couples are just there to take up space. you think that one couple, a caucasian husband and a korean wife, will be explored, as an issue appears between them halfway through the film, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods, which consistently scares the korean wife. the joke is funny the first time you hear it, but it certainly isn't by the ninth time they do it. the third couple is just painful to watch: it consists of mr. and mrs. page. they trade insults back and forth, and mr. page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he's not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wife.just like your typical american couple! before the hike, mr. page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute. one of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out mr. page taped it. so begins the peril, as the two guys track the group on their trip, and we wait.and wait.and wait.and wait for them to finally do something. when they do, it's a fiasco.you can't blame the cast. they try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with. the main culprit is director robert f. lyons, who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director's chair. lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy, sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot. there's even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes. then there is the sound department. the music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your television's speaker. don't bump your head on the screen! it isn't worth it to hear the poorly written lines. speaking of poor writing, lesseos gets some of the credit there as co-writer. the few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes. early on, lesseos knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife, so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs. when the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by lesseos in a well done and long fight, our cast all have a huge laugh together, despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere. yes, everyone is happy in the end. everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film, wishing for the good old glory days when mimi performed in the wrestling ring. zantara's score: 4 out of 10

this movie is soo bad that i've wasted way to much time already talking about it. soo bad...really... ...bad... and i'm not even that critical... ..i'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen it... sandra's few minutes show you how far she's really made it... i mean really anything next to this is really oscar worthy for her... i suppose the only way for her to look at it is there's no way but up after this one...i suppose she had to start somewhere... but really...soo bad... ...awful really... bad is too good a word for this s**t ....but i don't want to get mean now... but really how can u not after wasting 90 minutes... 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back... 90 minutes i could have spent doing something better...like sitting on my butt and staring into space..that would have been time better spent... (walks away shaking head)

what can i say after i say the one line summary. sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it can't save it. way too much pre occupation with guns. how can the hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns?? it's just worse than expected.

this movie is #1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen, with "lessons for an assassin" on the #2 spot.the acting is lousy (sorry, sandra bullock, but even your performance was horrible!), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. it had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. but contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one. boring.the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point, there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ...thumbs down on this one.

sandra bullock is my favorite actress..... but this movie was so horrible, i couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that i was actually watching something so crappy. ha ha. the audio editing is horrible, they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. because they're just weird and stupid. the script sucked. acting was horrible, storyline not very good. very unrealistic, even for a movie. but it is a 20 year old movie..... so i'll give it a bonus point for that. and yeah, the music was terrible. but we all got to start somewhere. and submitting these things is such a hassle..... 10 line minimum... bother. well now i know why i couldn't find this movie in the movie store.... i had to purchase it offline to see it... good thing it was only $.58 cents.... even though shipping was $2.59. oh well.... i don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film...

notable only as the acting debut of future big-time hollywood starlet, sandra bullock, this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect termite infestation. the storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. the production values stink of cheese. in fact, a total lack of production values would have been better...at least the film might have seemed grittier that way. the adr is laughably bad and omni-present in the film. it's debatable as to whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used.the performances are, for the most part, horrible, though there are a few exceptions. in those exceptions, however, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times. (i.e. characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye. bad direction.) also, the constant "weapon sound effects" (magazines being loaded, slides being cocked, etc.) are completely overused and, more often than not, totally out of sync with the on-screen actions. add to this cheesy "bad guy" vocal distortion for the lead villain (mainly so that you know he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film), and you have a recipe for disaster.the situations in the film go well beyond standard "suspension of disbelief" and become downright laughable. one lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he decides to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself. so, my questions are...why didn't he do this sooner, and why does he even have the butterfly knife. he wasn't searched? right. this is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this 90-minute package.in whole, "the hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad r-rated tv movie from the '80s. if not for the subsequent success of sandra bullock, this would have never found its way to dvd. but it has, so my only advice is to steer clear. watching this film may actually impair your iq.

this movie narrate the story of john belushi,based of his biography `wired' , wrote by bob woodward.all of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of john belushi we see one angel accompany belushi during few points of his life.michael chicklis in the character of john belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.the director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused. but the worse is that they have featured bob woodward that spoke with belushi before he died. for this negative points the movie is only a would-be attempt to narrate the controversial story of john belushi. my rate is 4.

and i have seen a lot of films. i saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day i remember the sickening urge to walk out. if you like john belushi, respect his talent, or even the sanctity of the cinema-- this film has nothing to offer you. it is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of belushi's biography, bob woodward. as we see the progression of belushi's life pass on the screen, woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character. the most offensive scene occurs when belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters "breathe for me, woodward." there are too many terrible things to mention them all, the least of which is the opening that has belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named "angel." i'll leave it at that.

journalist bob woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by larry peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. michael chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "the shield") is put in the unenviable position of portraying belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those "saturday night live" skits which are now part of tv history. it's like watching someone try to out-lucy lucille ball--it can't be done. the reason why there was such sorrow at belushi's death was because he was one of a kind. chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part, and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue. still, it's an uphill venture and no actor--no matter how talented--could have saved it. * from ****

any film school student could made a film 1,000 times better than piece of garbage. as someone who had read the book, i expected even a straight re-telling of the book would make this a fair film. there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond woodward's narrative and make a great film.well the director did go beyond woodward's narrative. he added a hip hispanic angel named velasquez that was not in the book. he had bob woodward interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the morgue. the film had all the insight of someone stoned on pcp staring at his navel.if this is a spoiler to you, you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made.

after seeing the dvd release of the blues brothers, and their mention of "wired" on belushi's bio, my boyfriend and i were hungry for more information on john belushi. i had heard of "wired" but didn't know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store. i understand that dan akroyd was really p***ed over this movie and i thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light. but that had nothing to do with it.the movie starts out okay, until they wheel in john's body to the morgue. when he wakes up on the autopsy table, and decides to run for it, then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie. john is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with "angel," a puerto rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor -- subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over.the two actors who portray john and dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors, (let alone anyone else related for that matter, i.e., lorne michaels,) making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life... but that is the tip of the iceberg.i believe this was supposed to be an "artsy" film -- john constantly being tormented by drugs (i.e., the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine,) in such a way that was also difficult to follow. the flashbacks are choppy, also making it difficult to understand.probably the most tasteless scene was when john is (literally,) forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it, saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yeah, we get the point without the grotesque portrayal.there are very few other actors we know of in the movie, (where's carrie fisher for instance? they were incredibly close. and jim belushi would have been a great person to show,) it looks very cheaply made, (we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s,) it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all, didn't show the side to john at all. i felt i knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of saturday night live.on one last note, bob woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie, arguing with john about writing his life story. for someone who was supposed to be very highbrow, concerning the bust on nixon, his calibur of person could match any writer in the national enquirer, and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward.skip this movie. if you want to see more on john, watch his movies, see clips of dan akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on john that goes along the lines of "man on the moon," which is ultimately what we were expecting. i guess this was a "moral" kind of movie -- you know, don't do drugs, but i guess the creators of this film didn't understand that his death made a number of people (like carrie fisher,) stop doing drugs altogether for that reason.

plodding, maybe that should have been the title. bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. all the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. surprisingly, this was produced by kelsey grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. cameron richardson is about the only element that lights up this film. robin trower's music is also a welcomed addition.

i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released.i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks & geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. definitely not what the dvd cover claims, "destined to be the next stoner classic", hardly.wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on. sound design was a bit poor. i think less would have been best.

when i think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what i think of. i don't want a monotonous, one-song robin trower soundtrack; i want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. the generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. the acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. the film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent. i can't believe people are giving it the high ratings i've read here. basically a forgettable, poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past. two stars is all i can come up with. sorry, guys.

i disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. i can't imagine this as even approaching "stoner classic." that would be like calling singles a "grunge film." the movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. at times i wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.the characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. who got killed? when? what? and this is how you act when your friend overdoses? complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality.as for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! it was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background, neither moving forward or back.i kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order, the acting and dialog would improve or something, somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie. after 112 minutes, it never happened.

the acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. the story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. half the scenes are pointless. there is not an inkling of character development. the score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. i'm glad i only rented the movie yet i still feel cheated. avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances. it seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film. this movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club, it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there.

the recent dvd release of good humor man labels the film as comedy. it's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. the monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers. it seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film, which is a complete waste of time.

have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-how did they screw it up so bad? this is one of those. the book by huffaker, "nobody likes a drunken indian" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. it seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we cared about the characters. this movie, which touches on some real concerns about indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. not well done.

similar story line, done many times before, and this was no improvement.15 minutes into this, and you should pretty much be able to turn it off - the ending was deja vu all over again.the only morals i could see out of this are: - stupidity + criminals do not equal success - if he screwed you before, he's gonna do it again

in the mid 1800s, irishman dennis hopper (as daniel morgan) emigrates to australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. instead, mr. hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. upon release, hopper hooks up with aborigine david gulpilil (as billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic bill hunter (as sergeant smith), jack thompson (as detective mainwaring), and others. eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. hopper's "scarcely human" performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film. mr. gulpilil heads up a strong supporting cast. the personnel involved in "mad dog morgan" make it not only worth a look, but also a huge disappointment. *** mad dog morgan (1976) philippe mora ~ dennis hopper, david gulpilil, bill hunter

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there is not a shred of historical accuracy, in fact reality is reversed. just one example: morgan preyed on the few ethnic chinese he encountered. the acting is over the top, the script is a poorly written lie. i have never seen worse fake beards.hopper arrived in australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero. since the script was ten made up on the fly, the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is.any movie about ned kelly is a lot better than this film.

the recent release of "mad dog morgan" on troma dvd is disappointing.this appears to be a censored print for television viewing. some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version. "mad dog morgan" deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut. however, even as released on dvd, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century australia. after having toured the old melbourne gaol, with death masks of convicts on display, it is "mad dog morgan" that comes to mind.

now out of all the shark movies i've seen, this one takes the cake! the plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. antonio sobato, jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. a megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. the view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places. with the mini-sub's weapons there, that would take out a whole school of sharks there. it was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity, although it would indeed cost him his life as well. like they say revenge has it's price, but was it worth it? that answer could go on and on, and this movie was a major letdown. the beginning was fine, and at the end, it went like the titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!

this could have been good,but sadly,its too inplausible,anthony sabato jr has a grudge...please!i wanted to like it,love shark movies ,someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this.ha!ha! the shark is cool but the story lacks...alot!

this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! the shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. antonio sabato is horrible, i mean even worse than normal. how does this guy work? the directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. i love shark movies and this one just disappoints. i've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work. i'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.

a really awful movie about a 30 meters long shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete. a waist of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie, but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost. even if u liked jaws, which i averagely did, don't see it even if you have interests in paleontology, don't see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors, corny plots during corny tv time, do humanity a favor and do not, i repeat, do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci-fi animal thriller still, some people gave it a ten ranting... don't know if they were serious or not (but sincerely expect they weren't)

hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . hey i think i`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen . oh hold on i`m not married and i`ve never been on honeymoon ! not to worry i`ll send in a video of someone elses wedding/honeymoon !!!!! mild spoilers !!!!!you`d think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve wouldn`t you ? as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed , best written and best acted part of the film , alas it`s all downhill from here as the family go to sea ( in reality a fog shrouded swimming pool ) in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi fin and their son spencer swears revenge against the fin . cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration . only thing is - and it`s so obvious you can`t fail to notice this - it`s not filmed underwater !!! , the director hasn`t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank . the underwater research base is blown up by the shark ( maybe it`s hired by greenpeace ? ) killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of frenchmen . what else happens ? no idea because i decided to watch something else no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt codd becomes a big fish in hollywood . you think you know about sharks matt ? you ain`t seen nothing yet

i was enticed into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb. the movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. so i rented it. bad idea. this movie was bad on so many levels that i'm glad that i had the option to fast forward. the shark itself is ok. it's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (i gave it a 2). the acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. i wasn't expecting much but i was continually surprised by this suckfest. antonio sabato jr. is some kind of biologist or scientist or something, i wasn't really paying attention. he goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course. by the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. first of all, if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station, what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident. the shark theory was advanced by antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against. antonio and this young college student, horrible actress by the way, just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble. what is with that? unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school i find this a little silly. the director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background. metal crafting is very important when your on a sub i guess. anyway i could go on but i've said too much already. bottom line: go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. then send email asking imdb to remove all record of this movie from their site. all memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. we can do it if we work together.

at last, a film to rival 'el padrino' and 'darkness falls' in terms of sheer and utter dullness. this is actually the first film i've ever given 1 out of 10 for on imdb, and with good reason.for one, the cast is nothing special. that's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l. bush's harrington. secondly, the production values a substandard - television sci-fi such as 'stargate' has more convincing sets, and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the sfx teams are filmed on dry sets with 'falling particles' that aren't very convincing. this film is literally 'drydocked'. the worst part though is that this film is boring. for the first 45 minutes, i felt as if we were going round and round in circles: "it's a prehistoric shark." "bullsh*t." "no really." "bullsh*t." "i'm not making this up." "bullsh*t." "there it is now!" "i didn't see anything." "let me guess?" "yup. bullsh*t." after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so. then we're back to the dialog run-around. dialog is not a bad thing, but that's all this film has. characters talking. that too, is not a bad thing, except this film isn't very good at it. the dialog is often contrived and clichéd, and is not very interesting to listen to. i don't see any point slandering the special effects; this film has worse qualities.the sets are small and unrealistic. the acting is sub-par. the script - oh lord, the script - is worse than a garbage of sci-fi television has to dredge up. it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was.yet another awful, awful addition to the 'megaloadon' (there's about four) series of films. bring on steve alten, please...

the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can't. oh yeah, and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot, and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents.now, the shark in this movie is a really fake looking cgi shark. basically this is sorta like shark attack 3, except more depressing. if you don't get what i mean, listen. the film's opening credits show "home movies" of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they got killed, and there's really sad and depressing piano music playing in the background. you would expect to see a shark or something, and you do. a brief shadow of the cgi shark floats around every few seconds but that's just it. also, i don't remember one happy facial expression at all throughout the film's entire runtime, a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story gets even more dull, and all the characters (the shark too) die in the end. i was thinking sabato would manage to kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl, but no, they all die, and the film ends with the shark, all blown up, and the submarine (with sabato's crushed and burned body in it) sinking into the abyss. if you're a happy person and you don't enjoy being depressed, then avoid this movie. if you're the opposite, then congratulations, you found your movie.

i'm not really sure where to begin. from start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. if you force yourself to watch this as i did, keep some vicodin handy for the pain. i will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. the movie is a cross between gumby rides pokey, meets the terminator, meets wally beaver playing cowboys and indians without the cowboys. i've seen better animation in the original cut of the blob. you will get more entertainment from watching gone with the wind while suffering from the puke and poops. bad acting and hokey lines will have you squirming and wishing you had rented peewee's big top or watched every episode of gilligan's island back to back. ugh..i'm going to go slit my wrist now.

i thought i could see something good but... i am tired after seeing this movie, i don't know what i hated the most: the script, the acting, the fx or the music. try to picture the worst power rangers episode and would still be to kind. i've seen better fx in fps games( the touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. i did liked how the women in the car was screaming, when the "monster" was walking around the car (even if she's looking in the wrong way). so give your self a break and don't watch this thing, at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you, trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.

sci-fi channel thinks this is sci-fi; it's a shame. big bugs, snakes, mythical beasties, on and on, they persist.some one at universal had the brains to include battlestar galactica (the new, good one) and firefly for a brief moment in their line up. i know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.a few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o trekkies. thanks so much, sci-fi! you know, you make movies so bad, even trekkies won't watch them, so you achieved your goal! fire serpent, ice spiders, manticore, larva etc.and a vast unrelenting crap-storm later, and they're still churning out just faster than the latest flu virus! how they do it is beyond my ken. why they do it, i just don't know. how they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and e-mails, i don't know either, but it's clear they don't think much of their audience or care about our opinions! they seem to think this is what sci-fi fans want! you would think one or two good productions with some sense would creep through when whoever green lights this junk is on vacation. at least they're employing the collection of misfit toys; many of the sci-fi movie of the week actors were in science fiction shows once and now need the cash. love you folks, and hope you get some better work!

sorry, after watching the credits, i thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring sf actors.boy was i wrong.the direction and story telling in this pos are terrible. i have never been so insulted by a production.i have great respect and love for many of the actors in this "film" but have to say they were conned.if you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. these are not only two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed.

i knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. but when i saw the beginning credits, i said "oh my god, bruce boxlightner, walter koenig (from star trek). gil gerard (from buck rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then i saw john callahan who used to star on my favorite soap, all my childen. put on a few pounds but he can still act. then there was veronica hamill. too bad i didn't sick around to see her in the film. i bailed out 20 minutes into he film. it was that bad. never did see william katt (from perry mason, and the greates american hero).all these stars and one lousy film. i hope hey got their paycheck.bad bad bad

this movie was beyond awful, it was a pimple on the a*s of the movie industry. i know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average, but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud, should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. i can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung. i can hear it now, "you getting' paid?" "nope, you?" i understand that this flick was more than likely made on a shoe string budget but even with that taken into account, it still could've been better. you wait for the appearance of a monster/creature and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn.i'm so mad at myself for spending a 1.07 on this stinker!!!

all i can do is laugh. wow. i like jim wynorski's movies, i really do. i mean, chopping mall is a classic. but this, what happened to this guy? he used to make funny horror movies, that tried to be good. but this was hardly even funny...i mean, i guess it was, because i laughed. the villain is incredible. i mean, horrible cgi. it looks...terrible. and the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. it is rated pg-13. a movie named "bone eater" you know won't be a blockbuster movie, you know it probably won't have a smart script. a movie like this may rely on gore...but no. it doesn't rely on anything really, it's just...crap. check it out if you want to laugh, though. but don't expect a good movie. i hope jim wynorski goes back to movies like chopping mall and ghoulies iv, because this and komodo vs. cobra ain't cutting it.

another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose. as the name implies, this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they're still using them. as usual, ancient burial grounds (can you say, "poltergeist?") have been disturbed by clichéd greedy land developers building stuff.the cgi, if it had been better, might have made the effect more treacherous looking, but they skimped on the budget, and it shows--to comical effect. the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings-that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere-but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like, and it wasn't impressive. the deaths are just poorly done, again with shoddy cgi. i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects. as for the "victims," they look they're going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams. it's always obvious who's going to get it: a character with only a few lines shows up, strange noises are heard, cgi dots fly, exit character. repeat (several times).still, there's a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable. unfortunately, the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on (so it's used too often) when he can't think of anything else for his characters to do. overall, it's pretty silly, but i've seen worse. this flick is cheap, but it's oddly fun to watch.

this movie actually almost made me cry.for starters the fake teeth. then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set. to make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash. then the talking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never exactly good like in good movies. also, it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set. and to make matters worse, ever heard of stereo? if the camera switches, the sound always stays centered. the actors talk like they are reading from a board staged behind the camera. and the zooming into another scene, how terrible childish.the music is so badly chosen that it never adds something. it only destroys any accidentally created excitement.to finish it up, the fighting scenes... my 3 year old niece would make a better fighting scene.this movie is not even good for a laugh, it's just that bad...

i don't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry. this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones. when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off, but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires, a combination that i thought could not fail. that is until i popped this into my dvd player. how ron hall managed to mess up something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me. first the acting. i didn't expect to much here to begin with because its an action movie and a b one at that, but the acting here is so bad i couldn't help but be bothered by it. expressions and vocal tones were way out of place, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the entire film and when there was it was so laughable it thought i was watching mad tv.for example that girly man scream derek lets out when he has to kill master kao who should have never been born in the first place. all in all i've seen better acting at elementary school plays.then there is the action. not even sub par compared to the things that have been done in action cinema as of late. but still the action was not a total let down as ron hall does seem to posses some martial arts skills. but even the skill he does have is over shadowed by the stupid things he does, for instance the part of the movie where he starts spinning and then the camera changes. i almost ripped a pillow in half.and the fight scene where his prison buddy fights off vampires by swinging his arms at them. wow.or how about the part in the jail where derek all of a sudden knows magic and can preform chants that make tap water holy water. and as far as the props go. the guns look like walmart toys, the teeth were stolen from halloween costumes, and words cant describe how bad the cg graphics are. i could go on for hours about all the things wrong with this movie and trust me this is just the tip of the iceberg. its only getting a 2 because it made me laugh. even though i was laughing at how badly the movie was done, a laugh is a laugh. i would say steer clear of vampire assassin unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning on getting tortured for long periods of time and want to practice

it's 2005, my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. so, why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. i've seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off, but this one...it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible. just...don't...watch it. i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. i feel like a small child produced this entire movie. there's not even an original plot line. vampire assassins, in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself. can someone tell me if, perhaps, this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didn't know it? it makes me wonder, what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment?

i rented this movie expecting it to suck, and it didn't let me down. i rented it with some friends as a joke. but, what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine.it starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box. it looks like a blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. its called vampire assassin, but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire? well this guy kills the of his own volition, so that doesn't make him an assassin.then, when you actually put the disk in it gets worst. first off the menu animation is lame. but, when you actually start the movie every thing from the set design to the lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible. you know a movie is bad when the credits even suck. the acting is laughable. the action is childish. the writing is elementary. and the directing is the worst>

a dark, yet humorous tale involving a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings.most of the film contained questionable acting,plot, props, and filming. the fight scenes were as hokey as a middle schooler's rendition of a wwii battle. the lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there. the props were bad because they did not even look like they could function in the slightest amount. the majority of the film appeared to be shot in someones basement (in some scenes you could see the rafters overhead in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement). the plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards, it just appeared to stand still at times with no reason for some characters actions. i felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series. it is similar to the movie blade, in that he is an african american vampire hunter. however, that is where all similarities end, and the movie looks closer to a saturday night live spoof.

i've spent a year deployed in iraq, and amongst the hundreds of movies i've seen here was this little gem called vampire assassin. judging from the cover (african-american with corn-rows with a curved blade, leather coat and the demeanor of a badass), i expected a blade rip-off. fair enough.so i pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight african-american with no blade, no cornrows and, well, nothing at all really except...i don't know. if you've read any of these other reviews, you get the gist of the flick. it sucks. bad. really bad.i don't know if it was the highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire, or the karate-kick sound effects for camera zooms, or the twenty dollar budget on props, or the "ok, we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a johnson & johnson parking lot," or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast-paced as two old people having sex, or the 7th grade acting talent, or the eccentric asian master who's either senial or on acid, or what, but the movie manages to force you to question your existence. and that's awesome.not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners. if you heckle (or mst3k) with your friends, this is the flick for you. i've seen it three times already, and i think it might've caused permanent damage on my psyche. if you still don't have any clue as to the quality of the film, people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it. not even by force.long story short, watch it. either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. it will rock your skull (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).

ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'vampire assassins'. derek washington (hall) is your clichéd cop-on-a-mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action. tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer (no not buffy!) to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave.'vampire assassins' is a horrible film. it rips off so many other films (can you say blade?) that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity. the script is non existent. the action is horrible. who says a micro-budget stimulates creativity? there is nothing even remotely interesting here. you will get nothing out of this except a headache. stay away at all costs.

in a world full of films -- like "you got served" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you'd never figure that there would be worse films... until now. ron hall's "vampire assassins" does more than cheese you off. it knows that you are mad at it. first: there are no assassins in this movie. in fact, there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. second: the location... is basically one location: some jackass's house (or basement. it's up to you.). third: the special effects (bluntly stated) can kiss my ass. fourth: the acting beats "plan 9 from outer space" in the worst-acting-ever category. ron hall can't act to save his life. finally (and definitely not the smallest problem): the editing. the person who edited this film better hope that i never find him. the cuts and shots are horrendous!!!! other issues: lighting (virtually none), the fact that the guy on the cover isn't even in the movie, and the fact that this film exists.to sum this film up, let us just say that i tortured the dvd copy before taking it back to hollywood video (don't worry! i used the mvp membership, so it was free!). never see this film!!!!

everyone knows that late night movies aren't oscar contenders. fine. i mean i'll admit that i was a bit tipsy and bored and figured i'd get to some skin-a-max. it's pretty bad when the info on the tv guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. it even gave it half a star. to be fair, i did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad. i couldn't stop laughing. i mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious. most of the time i think the people on the screen were trying their hardest to not to laugh. in fact i think in one scene they did laugh. anyways the movie didn't make sense. it was like that one sopranos episode with the fat gay guy. only the sopranos is great show. but it was terrible, i mean, no nudity, just sex scenes out of the 90's. you know the kind that use shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. i gave it a two cause this flick makes for a good drinking game movie. i mean with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. if its late at night, and all that is on tv is this and that tony little guy and his exercise bike, then i suggest tony little.

there are some great canadian films. there are some crappy ones. last night, i watched one of the crappy ones. it wasn't the typical canadian film where it tried to be so different by being arty. this film tried to be some type of hollywood gangster movie. it was terrible.from the beginning i had a sense that it would be a bad movie. it had some of the cheesiest dialouge a movie can have. there was this voice over for one scene and then it never returned. that always bugs me, when filmmakers just use voice over when they can't think of another creative way to tell a story.i know being in the canadian film industry, i should support my fellow brothers, but this movie is junk. the premise is something like a soprano's episode only not realistic. some banker's mafia boss dad is on his death bed and orders the son to make the business legit. not so original. and the workers complain about it, but they just take the fact that they will soon be out of jobs like nothing. to make it legit they use extortion. irony. but not the good kind. then some freak show girl who had an awful elvis wig and birthmark that covered half of her face robs the main character and kinda rapes him. anyways, this guy for whatever reason now likes to dress up as girls. then this banker hooks up with a hooker, when he has a beautiful future wife at home. but he falls for the hooker because the hooker dresses like a man and puts make-up on him. she blackmails him with some photos of him wearing bra and panties. yet, he still loves her. he also has no reason to leave his fiancé, but he does in order to be with the hooker.for a movie about organize crime and sexual fetish, there was neither action nor sex. it was like a late night cinemax porn movie without the good stuff. the would-be sex scenes weren't hot or sexy. it was all too amateurish. the movie had nothing going for it, just the lame plot.i don't think it was the actor's fault. i think they had a terrible script to work with. what stuck out the most was the ridiculous characters. the bad guy's name was uncle bunny or something. but the name wasn't important. it was they all were cliché. the dialouge was laughable throughout the movie, and fellow movie-goers laughed aloud at some of the movies "serious" moments. then, the worst of it all. it had to be the cheapest ending. if you can ever remember playing shoot out as a kid with either imaginary guns or toy guns. that was basically the ending of the movie. but i was more than happy it ended, and i had to warn my fellow canadians to not waste time or money watching this film.

what can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? not that much. with the average indie style film-making, this film has the timing all wrong. editing is just awful. as far as the gangster story, it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character. everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line. none of which were funny. the usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the "zany" one-liners. but the main character, the gangster that likes to dress up like a girl. only his motivation for dressing up like a girl is that he got mugged by a woman? weird. the ending of the movie had to be the nail in the coffin. it was anti-climatic to say the least. i mean i understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment for a proper shot out, but they might as well been using water guns. overall, i would say the hype leading up to it, (red carpet premiere in vancouver), it was a disappointment.

a blatant rip-off of "air bud", this movie is really about parents worrying too much about parenting. all the foibles of the characters (eg; adult coaches who dont know the game) are taken to the extreme- so much so that they are totally unbelievable, not funny.there is no semblance of reality here, folks and you'll not develop sympathy for any of the characters.the best thing about the movie is the good looking kits (uniforms) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near arlington heights, il, the home of the columbus crew's franchise player, brian mcbride.

this stinker is in mystifyingly frequent rotation on one channel here, and i've found myself watching in horror again and again. the script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks, and the production values match admirably.it's meant to be a children's movie, but features a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by the other actors; and it in general has the look of being filmed in someone's backyard (the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the background).it even all wraps up with a budget-ran-out voice-over sequence when the story, to one's relief, simply stops. the high-raters here must be either the producers - or the majority of the extras from the soccer game!

even my five year old was bored.very predictable, and overacted. this movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick, or wry commentary on the state of "pee -wee" sports.characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage.did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate...very mean spirited for a kid's movie.typical "mafia" behavior was boring and stereotypical.the dog, however, was so darn cute!!!!

ok, we were going along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explaining to our son, adopted from russia, that this was over-the-top acting and dramatization, so we could get to the dog playing soccer (since he plays soccer). but the last scene, in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15-20 minutes, "he's been replaced!!!!" this from an elementary child. i do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child; it displays adoption, orphanages and adults badly--and in the end, even though they win the game--the dog that the boy bonded with has to leave--and this is too much. please be wary if you have any adopted children, and beware families with biological children, because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and nasty. (the dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie....)

the worst movie i've ever seen, and i've seen allot. acting is horrible, plot is awful, idea is terrible, and no research was done what's so ever! ok, i admit, `air bud' was a pretty good movie, but not `soccer dog'. this "dog" is smaller than my cat! how can he possibly play soccer? even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half! it's horrible, don't watch this movie.

what i wouldn't do to give this film a re-write. extra disappointing due to the great beginning, solo dios sabe degenerates into a mess of superstitious bull after the halfway point and ends on a note so ludicrous, soppy and melodramatic i couldn't believe i was watching the same movie i started with. the film had numerous elements in its favor, such as chemistry between diego luna and alice braga so palpable i thought the screen would start sparking, a great soundtrack, and beautiful locations. instead of ending with the heavy-handed religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have kept the focus on being a frothy road movie with maybe some undertones about fate and superstition vs. logic peppered through. i understand the director's entire intent with the film was to make it about religion, but the fact is that it just didn't work, and he threw away so much great stuff from the beginning by doing so.

i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking, but was i wrong. this film was boring, especially in the beginning and the middle parts. i cannot comment on the ending because i just couldn't stand watching the whole film. the premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense. this student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. so if you are having trouble with sleep then i recommend that you rent this film.

this movie was disappointing. after 15 years, when it was brought back to mind from reviewing some info about mariel hemingway, all the regrets i felt about the movie came rolling back. while i remember peter o'toole, i was entirely oblivious to the fact that the female "lead" (okay, - she was little more than an object for discussion in the storyline) was ms. hemingway. i saw this movie back in the days when i wrote movie reviews, and warned people off it, as the stories just didn't work, and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out still hasn't made sense of the flow of the ideas.part of this may have to do with the fact that it looked like, after the original movie (whatever it was about) was filmed, an editor came in and tried to piece together something out of it. i don't know if this had been a project of a previous studio boss, and so was sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor, or this was a disaster from the original screenplay that attempts to salvage were unsuccessful. the theatrical version just didn't work.

this movie is at times a wild 80s college sex comedy, others a sweet romantic one... then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in dashes of science fiction... it is so uneven its almost ridiculous.but i would hardly rank it as one of the worst films i've ever seen except of course for the fact that they casted peter o'toole.there is absolutely nothing for him to work with here. poor dialog, poor performances to work off of, poor everything... and yet he's fantastic... there is not one good thing about his part and yet he makes it work if only on pure charm alone.the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed, making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually is...if any other actor was in o'toole's role, i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again, but a fine performance by peter o'toole despite all odds ensures that i'll remember this film for a long time to come... if only as a film that, maybe, could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as peter o'toole.

i really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife. i suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me.but putting that aside, i found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also,the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead vincent spano.i have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies i missed during that decade. it has been my pet peeve that eighties nostalgia buffs seem to focus on the same core canon of films usually featuring the brat pack actors and actresses and neglecting the other films like creator that have fallen through the cracks. but in the case of this feature i have to say i can understand it. not all of these eighties films were magical and creator is proof of this.

seagal fans beware- he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess. instead, seagal runs away from numerous fights, letting ja rule convincingly lose every battle. actually, ja rule could be an up and coming action star, but hollywood needs to let him at least hit puberty (which should happen in a few more years...) also, what sort of commando/terrorist wears a bare-midriff outfit? the chick in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for christina aguilera.back to seagal- when he finally does cut loose, it's his stunt double (heavily padded to resemble the bloated seagal) doing a lot of the work & taking the falls. i don't remember any aikido, either. it's just your standard kicks & punches you'd see in any straight-to-video martial arts turkey. not even "so-bad-it's-funny", either. just plain dull...

as a professional poker dealer for over 25 years i found this movie very hard to watch. too unreal. it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. common sense right? plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. who couldn't do that? the cheating was amateur stuff. palming, marked cards, etc. would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards? would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet? c'mon ! i gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful. next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right. ouch!!!

perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austen's works has been portrayed. perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation, but i'm afraid i am biased to the a&e version. i have a hard time imagining mr. darcy portrayed by anyone other than colin firth.the characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. her fancy for wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for darcy was not believable.darcy was portrayed tolerably well, i will grant him. he managed to maintain the aloofness that is required, but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful, especially in the proposal scene.mr. and mrs. bennet were also played well, but seemed lacking in many ways. the mean temper of mrs. bennet was not completely captured in her performance.mr. collins' was a good portrayal. very much in line with the book.i will refrain from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film.other problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as darcy being present at the first meeting with lady c., and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join lizzy on her visit to the collins'.the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes. the scene where lizzy and darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor. at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between lizzy, darcy and sir william when he commends the two on their dancing, as they performed very ill indeed.there were occasional moments that it kept me interested, but overall i find this version to be a disappointment. i would not advise this film unless you're like me, and you are excessively diverted by such follies.

i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years. i had never seen this adaptation, so when i had heard of it, i came here and read all the excellent reviews. on that basis i eagerly ordered it from netflix. what a cruel disappointment! they have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. although this adaptation seems to have used every word that jane austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion. even though it was done as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week.mr. bennett too harsh, mrs. bennet just a chattering chipmunk, mr. darcy as lifeless as a nutcracker, the bennett girls almost indistinguishable and mr. wickham a man who no one would look twice at - hardly the appealing cad! i'm quite put out!

if you want to truly experience the magic (?) of don dohler, then check out "alien factor" or maybe "fiend", but not this. alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but "nightbeast", which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor, is just plain dumb. actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially mr. monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from alien factor. a spaceship crashes on earth and there's a critter inside, of course, who runs around vaporizing people. and ripping off arms, etc. and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too, until it gets shot out of his hand. and that's really about it. "alien factor" beats this mess hands down, if you really want to see a good don dohler movie, check that out instead. and rip don dohler, 12/2/06.

ok, when i say "wow," i mean, "jesus, please help me." i have an old vhs copy that was printed before troma got a copy of the title. the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. watch out!!! and by that, i mean watch out for those special effects. there is an amazing number of mistakes. the acting is terrible, but i'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff. the film itself is really grainy and poorly lighted. in one particular scene, it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him. then it shows day again. *shakes head* i usually like low-budget horror films, but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it. the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn't stereotypical. so for that, and only for that... i give it a 3 out of 10.don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day. you'll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes.

after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh ok i'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. a terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. three nearby campers investigate. from the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'nightbeast' emerges, ok so i lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. the campers are quickly killed by the nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people. the towns sheriff jack cinder (tom griffith) is informed. he alerts his deputy lisa kent (karin kardian) and gathers a posse of men together to investigate. meanwhile the nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. his two annoying kids run for help. they approach a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "someones running towards the house". the guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the nightbeast, it kills the girl as well. then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser, maybe the nightbeast ain't so bad after all. once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun/laser battle with the nightbeast. after possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the sheriff, his deputy and a local man jamie lambert (jamie zemarel) survive. but the nightbeast is still alive, bullets seem to have no effect on it. the next day the sheriff visits the towns mayor, bert wicker (richard dyszel) and his girlfriend mary jane (eleanor herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town. he refuses saying a party he is holding for the governor (richard ruxton) cannot be cancelled, and that he doesn't want to create a panic situation. the sheriff evacuates the town anyway. two doctors, steven price (george stover) and ruth sherman (anne firth) are attacked by the nightbeast before they can leave. however, they manage to scare the nightbeast away and survive. together with the sheriff his deputy and jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. written and directed by don dohler this has to be an amateur film, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many dohler's are involved. for that reason i should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn't stop it, or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department. it has no story or purpose, things just happen to waste time, whats with drago (don leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend suzie (monica neff)? this and many more scenes add nothing to the film. the script has no logic either, why does the nightbeast stick around the town once it's been supposedly evacuated? the special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when the nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect an 80's spectrum would be ashamed of. there's not really much blood or gore in it, a ripped open stomach, a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor. credit where it's due, the nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part. there's a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed, music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch. less than stellar acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through. and the worse thing about this film? it commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest. sorry don mate, but don't give up the day job! definitely one to avoid.

an hulking alien beastie crash-lands on earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen! all in all, it's pretty silly stuff. i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. i actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects. however it doesn't help when the monster provides the movie's only truly entertaining moments and he isn't on screen for a large portion of the film's running time. the acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero sheriff cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the film's hottest chick. i also have to take off points for blatantly copying the thing from another world (1951) on several occasions. when the monster isn't on a rampage, nightbeast is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun. watch this one back to back with the 1951 thing and see the difference characterization, attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie.

from hardly alien sounding lasers, to an elementary school style shuttle crash, "nightbeast" is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest. the almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story. the acting however is not nearly as beastly, many of the young, aspiring, actors admirably showcase a hidden talent. particularly don leifert and jamie zemarel, who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film. nightbeast would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small maryland town.

i was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull her hair out in frustration through most of this movie. i thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the dairy barn any minute. so i cheated, grabbed the remote, and was relieved to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes. i should have turned the channel. cute, it had potential, but yuck!

it is terrible! it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. the story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. i don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. the acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful. the only scene i didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film. how do people get finance for this stuff? i don't mind alternative films but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure? i would call 'price of milk' amateurish if it wasn't an insult to amateurs. this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged!

this movie is somehow showing 6.2 stars, it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations. i am at a loss to explain this.avoid this movie at all costs. you have only a certain number of hours on the earth, don't waste 1&1/2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano!!!there is no story as apparently the director "wrote" (and i'm guessing with a blunt orange crayon) the next day's script at the completion of the day's shooting. the "story" has been called whimsical, no it is aimless, there is maybe enough "story" to fill a commercial. don't you hate ads?now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here. and similarly the writer/director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work "toy love" so to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you're paid to watch it avoid it.to paraphrase monty python's search for the holy grail, "run flee!"

this movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly "haaaa" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).for everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled "comedy." the movie strictly follows the formula of the later "scary movie" films, as well as "epic movie" and "meet the spartans," though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating. still, the lampooning of intellectual and peacemaking figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy brainpower. "superhero movie" is particularly and consistently nasty to stephen hawking, introducing him as a sex-starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick.the plot is based on "spider-man," with "batman begins" and "x-men" thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy. much of the movie is slapstick, but not in any invigorating or interesting way. the longest-running gag is a fart joke, and early on the scriptwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in conspicuous piles of fake animal poo automatically enlivens an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from "spider-man." perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it, notably absent in other recent parodies. the filmmakers act as though they're doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce around the screen. an extremely abbreviated length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the zest of the presentation makes "superhero movie" tolerable rather than horrifying.

went with some friends and one of my friends mom, thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break, but the movie turned out awful. we all agree it shouldn't have been pg-13. more like r material. lots of sexual dialog, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). not worth the time or money. strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. if you do end up going, don't take smaller children. not the type of movie to see with the family! if curious about the content, check out the content advisory section on the superhero movie page on imdb. most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude. especially when they make fun of steven hawking.

i thought this would be funny. i did. i don't know what happened. but i think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting. i don't know who this kid is, he could be a very nice person but he wasn't right for this movie. and the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious. for example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then keith david starts speaking, or leslie nielsen, or marion ross, and it's like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad. but when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again. the spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing. i mean it had a couple of funny bits, as i do remember laughing a couple of times, but right now i don't remember why and it was only a few days ago.really i'm giving it a take it or leave it rating but i think most people should just leave it.

and so it started with "shreik" a send up of horror films, then we had scary movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: scary movie* scary movie 2 scary movie 3 scary movie 4* date movie meet the spartans not another team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)and.....super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny. using the rip-offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly, but not many producers seem to know how to do that. scary movie(1) did it well, the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise, but it was redeemed by scary movie 4. not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well...and to its credit i am sick of teen movies. however, this movie plays like a bad version of all of these. it relies on slap stick the would make even the 3 stooges cringe, violating the image of stephen hawking, and then when people begin to get bored (and the producers knew when this would be) we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit. to conclude, spoofs should be about making a homage-like mock-up of an original movie with an original storyline, not plastering random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film. ...i shudder at the thought of "sci-fi movie" and get my seppuku knife ready

this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life. it is a complete waste of money and time. i went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said "wow what a good movie." someone actually walked out! it was absolutely terrible! it was disgusting and i hated every minute of it. my friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough. it was not funny at all. believe me i went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it. it was ridiculous! i've seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst! i mean a scene in the movie is with an old man making out with a dead person in a coffin. i just can't make up these things.

i took my 14 year old to see this movie. we left after 15 or 20 minutes. it was absolutely awful! this movie should be rated r at the least. i am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. it was a waste of money. i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was way beyond crude. i was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was. i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content. i don't understand how the rating system works.??

this film was the worst film i have ever seen. it was a complete waste of money. if i had not been in the cinema was my two young cousins (who also thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as i thought), i would have left the cinema. there were two points in the film that i almost laughed, but the rest of it was either boring, ridiculous or painful. i thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies (which i love), but in fact it was mainly based on spiderman, with a few oblique references to other superhero movies such as fantastic four and batman. i really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film. do not waste your money with this film-there are many other better films out there!

i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. i'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me. i couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. it was crude and offensive. i was totally misled by its pg-13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it. i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon, and i thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe i just don't remember the preview correctly) . plus, drake bell (the movie's main character) stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers. i really didn't think that the movie's content would be as risky as it was. i should have done more research about it before i went. however, i'm hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it.seriously, do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. the rating should have been r. there are tons of sexual references, drug references, and disturbing events throughout the movie. examples: drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes that involve men grabbing women's breasts, lots of profanity, drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people get stabbed, hit, and hurt in the movie, and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded. there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. it was really demeaning to women in general. the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series, so that should tell you something right there. please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs, and violence. most children and teenagers can't decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality.i do have a sense of humor. i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre. but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying.as for the overall quality of the movie, i didn't think it was that original or funny. it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. the acting wasn't too bad, considering how bad the script was. if you're an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie, skip this one or rent it.

scary movie 1-4, epic movie, date movie, meet the spartans, not another teen movie and another gay movie. making "superhero movie" the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre. now i'll admit it i have a soft spot for classics such as airplane and the naked gun but you know you've milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off. in fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell-out leslie neilson.you can tell he needs the money, wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good capitan would. in no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he's not helping it. but if i feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor drake bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment. the people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpes.after spoofing disaster films in airplane!, police shows in the naked gun, and hollywood horrors in scary movie 3 and 4, producer david zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from spider-man to x-men and superman returns.shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly, high-school outcast rick riker (drake bell) begins to experience a startling transformation. now rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he possesses the strength of ten men. determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime, rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of the dragonfly -- a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.but every superhero needs a nemesis, and after lou landers (christopher mcdonald) is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry, he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous hourglass. intent on achieving immortality, the hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. craig mazin writes and directs this low-flying spoof.featuring tracy morgan, pamela anderson, leslie nielsen, marion ross, jeffrey tambor, and regina hall.hell superhero movie may earn some merit in the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than meet the spartans and epic movie. but with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date. laughless but a little less irritating than meet the spartans. and in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the spartans. but maybe that's a good reason. there are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was meet the spartans from our memory.my final verdict? avoid, unless you're one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema. as bad as date movie and scary movie 2 but not quite as bad as meet the spartans or epic movie. super villain.

i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie, that was humorous, however my expectations were let down. this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg-13 movie, this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie. i wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this.even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie, beware of a truly stupid movie, there's no humor in the movie, just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia, something that shouldn't even be joked about. i would like to know what happened to pg-13 movies, that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old? this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re-rated.

here's a spoof that's guaranteed to entertain folks in the iq range of homer simpson. it's a cheap shot at every great superhero, notably spiderman and batman. but it doesn't end there; it gets progressively worse until it disintegrates into a pathetic ensemble of slapstick trollop by the truckload.for those interested in the plot, you've only to watch spiderman while under the influence of some heavy narcotic. what you get is dragonfly man  a boy wonder, who loves the girl next door, suddenly inheriting some stupendous super-powers.the rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but don't' take my word for it! for kids, this is somewhat amusing; for adults it's a great film to drop the kids off for.

superhero movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over "parody" movie movies which i despise so much. i wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but i know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go, than superhero movie is probably near the top. unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.superhero movie has a decent cast of c-list celebs. it's got drake bell (the kid from disney's drake and josh), leslie nielson (airplane!), tracy morgan (snl and 30 rock), and a few others scattered throughout. although it has the star power to light a 40-watt bulb, the movie fails to utilize any humor.this movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot, and not one single joke is funny. i didn't laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time.don't see this movie. don't even think about it. for the love of cinema, just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one....oh, who am i kidding? they'll probably come out with another one by fall.

the movie starts with a spiderman spoof which is your introduction to rick riker (played by drake bell of "drake & josh" fame, personally i'd have given the movie to josh who is much funnier) and the "rick punchers" joke is lifted right out of airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. rick's class is on a science trip to the amalgamated genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, brent spiner (data in star trek tng) playing dr strom. rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from.we meet our next big star names at rick's home, his aunt lucille (marion ross of happy days fame) & uncle albert (leslie nielson of airplane, police squad & naked gun fame). and we're introduced to carlson on the amalgamated board of directors (dan castellaneta from the simpsons) who is then very promptly killed. we're told rick has slept for 5 days & get some cheap, crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention. the stephen hawking lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny.we get another spiderman spoof (rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there as jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead. you get to see rick's 1st powers emerge (gripping ability & speed) then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong. we also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed. we get a flashback and a batman spoof in which we discover rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. spoofing spiderman again ricks uncle is shot with jeffrey tambor (from hellboy) playing the hospital doctor. we then get an x-men spoof (done very badly as patrick stewart is about as white as they come), barry bonds is played by yet another lookalike.we meet invisible girl (played by pamela anderson looking stunning in her costume!). ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he fixes his ability to see & breath through it) is another batman spoof. the tom cruise youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike (and not a very good one at that). there are lots of modern references like youtube, facebook & wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day. there's a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do those either) when jill is helping aunt lucille make thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isn't very funny, just infantile.the aunt farting scene isn't particularly funny, just incredibly childish. anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12. she's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke (is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of?) at her funeral, and the even worse cremation joke.we get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie (prince charles & nelson mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is landers wins the "douchebag of the year" award. landers is revealed as the hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past jill twice in the same direction).obviously the hourglass is foiled, jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one.

it's not fair. i was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. i mean, i like drake bell from drake and josh, and leslie neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, airplane and the naked gun. however, after seeing superhero movie, i'm glad i didn't even have to pay for it. it just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. more like a dollar and a few pennies. because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes. and as disappointing as this film was i'm glad the running time was that short, if not shorter. i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary, and above all, stupid, some of the scenes were! and above that, i've seen better acting from a wooden dummy(without the ventriloquist). it's as if craig mazin purposefully wanted to make a film that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than "meet the spartans". very disappointing indeed.

when a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero dragonfly...superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. sadly however, despite the presence of david zucker (who was involved with airplane!, top secret and the naked gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! the fault mainly lies with the gags. it's simply not funny enough. some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. the x-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. blazing saddles this isn't! one of the key things about the best spoof movies, like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. this makes it even funnier. even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. again funny. the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, then try and spoof them. as a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! the cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.as recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as epic movie, date movie, or the awful meet the spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.

well the name in the summary should tell you everything. fred olen ray - the modern king of low budget flicks, be it for tv or direct to video (i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of drive-in b-movie double features and all).creator of such cult(?) classics, like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur island....well i kind of like this guys stuff. its mostly entertaining (in a distinctly cheesy, campy and especially cheap kind of way) and if he's one thing, he's a pro - something you can't say for all guys in the movie biz.but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his oevre. insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes. if you are out for real f.o.r. goodness (or rather badness), look out for the above mentioned ones, and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (i think he lost a bit of his edge lately).

this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. and that comment comes from the writer's cousin. this movie was so flipping bad, it made "hulk" (the second worst movie ever) look like "the departed" (one of the greatest movies in cinematic history). if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie. if you have a brain, then you definitely will not. when i rented this movie, i actually fell asleep while watching it. the next day, i finished it from where i left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.

when i borrowed this movie, i wasn't expecting a high-quality performance, but this was just sad.most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. there's nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like "oh no! my dad is invisible!" or "i wonder what this does?" in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with. there are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts.the story is decent, though it would be fairly easy to guess, considering that there aren't too many real plot changes. lots of holes, too. for example, the dad is invisible, and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again. so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store. couldn't he just ask his dad for the cash?this shows up in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb, like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting, or walking around with his head covered at all times. funny at first, but it gets old.2/5, because it is watchable, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way... like the monotone recitation of lines.

okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. however, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. for example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. so, does he ask his father for the dough? nope, he steals it and gets caught. kids, if i'm ever turned invisible, i'll advance your allowance, ok? also, while this kid is at the police station (no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting), his beautiful blond teacher comes in, announces who she is and where she works, then busts the child out of the slam in front of the cops! to make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement. you know, i hate to pick, but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough. y'all avoid it!

i received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know i'm a big fan of low budget horror flicks. kaufman studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. i loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until i saw bugged...what happened?this movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. ronald k. armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. after reading the credits we discover he gave himself the most important role in the film!?! two words mr. director "acting lessons" ok? mr. armstrong joins the ranks of other writer/directors who cast themselves in their own movies and that's mistake number two. the only thing that i believed saved this film was the artistic camera work and the musical score, (let's hear it for the crew!) the cast of other actors who in the beginning of this production seemed a bit cold, really warmed up toward the middle and end of this production. everyone pulled together and helped to pull this film off. ronald armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a decent director or actor but, i'll say this of him-he seems to know how to organize people to get them all to come together and pull his productions off.this film, i have to say can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie because if mr. armstrong was able to pull this off, any one else can too. if you get a chance to see this film, watch it for the sake of getting inspired to do "better" in the future. hollywood needs bigger and better horror flicks to keep this genre coming back from it's grave.

big spoiler right here: this film is b!a!d! but enjoy, it's good bad.bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that uncle ned's carlsbad cavern home video looks like an imax experience. since it's a troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. the brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, "%@#$! what was that?" which is second only to the oft screamed, "now what?"any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to ronald armstrong, the writer/director. when one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper/termite/chiapet thing, armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute, but dumb-as-a-doorknob, "divine." while she's being hit on, divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat-poison/oatmeal mixture on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling over dead from the fumes!the killer bugs are as frightening as piñatas, which they too closely resemble. the effects used to move them include dragging them across tile floors real fast with their legs dragging behind.the highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up, but they were either out of cash or never had any, so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames, they simply let the screen go black (eat you heart out ilm).the cast is virtually all black. how can the naacp consistently censor something truly funny like amos and andy (which depicts characters certainly no less similiar than those on 99% of all white comedy shows), but says nary a peep about something like bugged. oh well, it's best they don't know about how demeaning this film is to all involved (as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group, frankly). before they put the kabosh on bugged, get some friends together and get ready for the plan 9 of bug exterminator movies.

in what attempts to be a positive story, dolph lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for...bird droppings. actually, the nitrogen gas that exudes from the muck on this island is what they are after.there was only one good thing about this movie -- the island location in which it was filmed was beautiful. otherwise, the story drowns itself leaving the actors with nothing to work with. result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, lots of blood, and a few shots of women topless. if you want pointless violence (sorry, the storyline can't even give the violence a point, though it tries) then this is the movie for you.parents: be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood, driving the r rating.

about the movie itself, there are ample comments. i just wanted to say something about the german version, which i have seen recently on tv. it is heavily cut. from 103 to 76 minutes! it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv. i understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. they did not only cut "gore-shots" - they have cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. like: "we have to attack them" - one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp - protagonist running away.when the assault on the island begins, it isn't even possible anymore to follow the storyline. all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic, disconnected scenes that don't make any sense anymore.i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense.i think i would have given the original 7/10 the german version is worth only 1/10get it on dvd (and check the runtime first) or forget about it.

i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night. well, there's not one ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. the score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl," the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes. the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music. this joey de francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is helping with movie scores). is it possible to not only get my four dollars back, but have my therapy sessions paid for as well? this movie, interestingly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once. just get the ear plugs ready!

i am a huge amy adams fan and have been for many years. i am also a big fan of musicals. with that said this is not a good movie on any level. it is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor. amy adams is awkward to watch act with scott g. anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting. all the performances come off as very amateur. the music performances are pleasant, but nothing special. scott g. anderson is just an bad actor! i assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice, but it's just not the case. he has an average voice and sings on key, but that's about it.i guess i can see why amy adams did this movie with the singing element i just wish she had not. i could rant about other poor elements of this movie, but i'll leave it at that.

having endured this film last night, i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end. throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and taut, camera work appalling, and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school "amateur dramatic's society".the only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits, other than that it was pure dribble.

i would say this is a background movie. play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry, checking email, etc). i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted. wrong! it was done in 2009! the screenplay/script is pretty awful. i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. ughh. it almost seems like it's a made for tv movie based on the cinematography. am i watching a tv show? even the secretary breaks out into song. what the f@#$ is going on?! actually she seemed to have the best voice. amy adams was so great in enchanted. lead actor is average. disappointed for sure. this movie would have been good for lifetime, but that's about it. :(

i watched this film because i thought it would be a classic amy adams movie. wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels it staggers the imagination. it is poorly constructed for one, also the script and the acting is just awful. but hey even johnny depp has a slew of bad films under his belt. the upside of this movie would be amy singing, and even on that score i believe better songs could have been chosen. amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a die-hard fan of hers you will probably watch this title no matter what, just don't expect too much. i wish i could have found more to like but it was just painful to watch. i recommend sunshine cleaning or doubt.

great subject matter, director, and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (and hello, this is not a film-noir!) the lackluster, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose, other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the american and mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. the scene that made me hate this film is when montalban and mitchell make a daring escape from their captors, race to presumably save montalban's injured partner from being murdered by a goon with a gun driving a piece of farm machinery, montalban says something like, "quick - we must try to save him," but instead of doing so they lie on their stomachs and watch in agony for about 5 (!) minutes of screen time as the machine bears down on murphy and finally runs him over (or so we assume - the machine simply stops, another goon detects the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots at them as they run off again.) scene over. the whole thing is so horribly filmed and utterly anticlimatic. there's nothing worse than a protagonist (ostensibly, montalban, though he's off screen for over half the film) who doesn't even try. jeez, ricardo, do something!i know it's anthony mann, but hell, not all of his films are classics, people. how bad does an old movie have to be around here to get anything lower than a 6 rating?

the characters was as unoriginal it hurts. the little skinny dorky computer geek, the funny african-american with stupid clisché punchlines, cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl. the actors is at best mediocre. ecsept from norton who does a pretty good job as the bad guy. the rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. its all in all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as their playground where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table. i mean, why work for a living when you can rob people?and,.. who the f**** messes with the traffic lights in a major european city?!? and in the middle of the friggin day!? think of all the damages and not to say deaths among innocent civilians. what about all the ambulances and firetrucks? i created no compassion for the main characters, and weather mr wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, i could not give less of a fart.

"the italian job" is a caper movie done by the numbers. riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.the biggest problem is that "the italian job" possesses no imagination at all. i've seen it all before and done better then. the acting is fine the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.let's tick off the cliches: - "old-school" criminal father figure and his protege - another gang member jealous of protege - a double-cross - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to - good criminals always outwit the bad guysand that's about the first fifteen minutes. everything is so predictable. even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. this is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so i already knew what to look for.for me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. parts of "the italian job" just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.the acting is passable, with the crew (seth green, jason stratham and mos def) being at least fun to watch. mark wahlberg is just too smarmy as the "nice guy" hero while charlize theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. donald sutherland is a class act as always and shows up wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. given the imdb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which i can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent "ocean's eleven" outshines the non-event that is "the italian job".***spoiler***at the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to norton's character. are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful? he didn't deserve that, simpering creep that he was.***end spoiler***

i was really disappointed by this movie. great actors in it, and potentially a great plot, but it just seemed to limp along.charlize theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed like 90% of her on-screen work was in car chases done with austin minis. product placement gone wrong, so very wrong.the direction seemed off, too. edward norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the start. every time the camera would pass over him, it would linger too long and norton would grimace or something. c'mon, hollywood, give us a little credit! it's okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to telegraph it.sorry, but this movie was just below average. i have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie, but this one just didn't have it.

i must admit, i was against this movie from the outset but i tried my hardest to be impartial, i really did, but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky british classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset.people in my house were watching this so i swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films (i have studied them at uni after all).as expected for an american film of this sort, the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. indeed, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.yet the characterisation was abysmal, the set-pieces could very easily have been spliced from any american schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character.seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the us version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of donald sutherland's character. this allows our us cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic, dewy-eyed vengeance-seeking against the 'evil-doers' which it milks to predictable excesses. this is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring charlize theron (oh pretty! oh so pretty! look at her pretty, wounded bambi eyes, everyone!) which were thoroughly nauseating. her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of resident evil or tomb raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with british cinema which was already chock-full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. but i digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham-fisted manoeuvre i've seen in some time and exposes cynical hollywood blockbuster-lust for what it is.if you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, do not go to see this film! if i had the opportunity of watching 'fight club' or 'american history x' after seeing ed norton in this, i would have declined. likewise jason statham with 'lock stock' (and i suppose 'the transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing).sadly, all the set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking, 'wow! he's smart!', 'coo! he's cool!', 'hey! what a tough guy!'. then there's the 'funny pc guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. to be honest, if you've seen one or two films like it, you might easily confuse the two as clones from the jerry bruckheimer stable. not that jerry is irredeemably awful, by the way, but he just uses the clichés to excess as everyone knows (or should).this is where i have to come clean. i didn't manage to make it to the end, so i couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the michael caine version made it but, i'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films that, if i'd seen it at a cinema, i would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. it's not just that it is another identical by-the-numbers ocean's 14 or something (ocean's eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamour, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but i couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.so, if you are expecting 'the italian job' and not 'ocean's 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters, some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut-out script-writing then do not watch! i don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet-job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. seriously, show some pride! i felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when i first heard that the film would be made. avoid at all costs!p.s. some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing.

this is a woeful hollywood remake of a classic british film. everything that made the original "italian job" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie "scripted" by donna and wayne powers and listlessly "directed" by f gary gray. i am amazed that troy kennedy martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last 40-odd years. even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thing.the humour is forced, the drama is laboured, all the characters are cookie-cutter likable crims (with the exception of charlize theron's implausible, beautiful safe cracker/rally driver)and the plot only matches the original on the following points:(1) three minis (the modern bmw-made versions, but minis nonetheless)(2) use of the names croker and bridger for 2 of the main characters(3) disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.(4) er, that's it.otherwise, what you get is a bland and implausible american by-the-numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do. the cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd-polishing exercise after reading the script. none of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly british flavour has survived being fed into the hollywood hamburger machine. do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. it's a wonder that noel coward hasn't done an aunt nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats.italian job? more like italian jobbie.

the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only "star power" if we can call it that consists of joe estevez. i don't know what is more shocking. the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. if you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them. someone even went as far as saying that the actress/writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. yeah! and joe estevez could have more money than his brother martin. if you want to check it out anyways i highly recommend watching the mts version of it. at least you'll laugh a lot without going insane.

soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling. it also starred joe estevez, gregg thomsen, and robert d'zar as the angel of death.the story begins with introduction to soultaker, played by joe estevez. we quickly learn what soultaker's role will be in this movie.next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named "summerfest". in this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. the girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class. the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn't really clear or pertinent to the story.at summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isn't encouraged to date natalie. soultaker makes an appearance as well, with apparently his boss the angel of death. here d'zar's character points out who is to die and who's souls are to be taken. it's revealed as well, that soultaker will have a character conflict regarding natalie, and how he deals with her because of someone in his past.meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to summerfest, and zach convinces her to ride home with them. during the ride home, soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds.the rest of the story surrounds the soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers, and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live. the class and character conflicts lay in the story, but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved.there's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama, there's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring. it's not really acceptable, and it would've been nice had this been dealt with differently, somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience.the story and acting are decent. the soundtrack is ok, and even the production values are good.robert d'zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death. joe estevez does ok, however sometimes his role acting a bit flat. vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie, although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes.this may sound odd, but this movie definitely could've benefited from some pointless nudity. vivian teases us a bit but that wasn't enough.in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie. the results, it's worth watching. just don't expect a perfect production.3/10

the film soultaker is essentially an older form final destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... the film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... if this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... as for the actual film, i recommend watching the mst3k version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring martin sheen's brother...

when a movie's claim to fame is that martin sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. "soultaker" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. it's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.the plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be. joe estevez isn't much of an actor, so luckily for the audience, he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking. this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror/fantasy franchise, considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each dies one at a time...will any live? who really cares. though it sounds like i hated this, i didn't. i just didn't like it very well, but i was interested through most of it, so i guess that counts for something.my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg-13 for language, violence and nudity.

now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs, and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. but honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. sort of a hair metal, dokken version of carnival of souls. but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains. but if it was on cable, and i was bored and drinking beer--sure, i'd watch it again. but then again, i've watched howling vii about five times now, so maybe you really shouldn't be listening to me.anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie? and why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much?

okay, to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept. given a few script rewrites, some decent actors and a budget, this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the mst3k fodder it turned out to be.still, it was better than "armageddon."

ok, i read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and i have to admit that i can identify with his position.micheal, i hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. i've seen this movie in the mst3k form. even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it. and this is one of those films ("mitchell" is another) where the mst3k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better. you know they had some unfair fun at the actress' expense because it made for a livelier episode.imo, the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something, and had a few decent, effective moments here and there, should keep it out of the 'bottom 100' ("tangents/time chasers" is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either).but it is still not a very good movie. i don't blame the writer/lead actress for being who she is. it's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film. the writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash, and the dialog is often barely up to abc afterschool special standards. the cast sincerely gives it their best effort, and the acting in general is definitely head-and-shoulders above abortions like "future war" or "space mutiny", but there aren't any really professional level performances here, with the exception of 'big joe' estevez, who is hammy but suitably intense. i never saw the full original cut, but mst's sampling of "soultaker" was representative enough to make these facts plain.oh, and the film has robert z'dar in it. that is, imo, a real 'kiss of death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously. yes, he's big and scary looking in his role, but i just hate the guy as an actor. (in real life, i wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable).there were little things i liked about the film. for instance, the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable. the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects, and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable. it didn't really work, but it might have with just a little more tweaking.so anyway, mr. rissi, better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if the 'buzz' was good. and ms. miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the movie wasn't that bad.

a ridiculous, badly acted mini cooper infomercial. includes cameos from pepsi, dell, etc. absolutely nothing worth rescuing here. particularly bad are donald sutherland, the music score, scene transitions, etc. an embarrassing production.hey, they should pay you for watching this one.

ok, i saw this film through mystery science theater 3000, but i did see the movie, so i figured i would leave a comment on it. i just love once again how joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the oscar winning roles left and right. soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. it seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities. this is one of my favorite mst3k episodes, simple because a lot of what they mention is what we are thinking throughout the film and i'll explain why in a moment.natalie and zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work things over. but since zach is in upper lower class and natalie is in middle class, it just ain't gonna work. but on the way home, they and zach's friends get into a car accident and now the angel of death/soultaker is after them to meet his quota of soultaking. but also it seems like he's had some kind of other life relationship with natalie and just can't seem to move on. so now natalie and zach must race against the ever appearing five million times a minute clock to save their souls and lives.well, i guess zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven, i wonder if black sabbith was wrong too, lol. basically there are a lot of plot holes in this movies, like no one can see the characters and they can't be killed, yet somehow they can still press buttons and open doors? the angel of death had a very strange face and was a bit distracting from the story itself. soultaker was just a lousy film that was rushed and makes you just feel so bad for joe, the under-appreciated sheen/estovez brother.2/10

that's how i was when i walked (staggered) out of this "film". i couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. i was stuck in the middle. trapped.the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. the daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i've witnessed.as for the stock footage... well at first one...wait.why am i reviewing this film? why do i acknowledge its existence? please, don't watch it. do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry.

well, how to start? i saw the italian job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop i couldn't quite remember why i had a bad feeling about it. now i do.after voting for the ratings for this film i saw the statistics. apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. no wonder. they didn't pay enough to charlize to flash and i guess some girls magazine has rated mark wahlbergs abs "awesome".other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever b-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! the first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist. all in all, lots of noise about nothing.i think charlize theron is good and ed norton could be more as he's been before. apart from donald sutherland's "look, i'm here too" appearing in the beginning i'd say this movie ought to have a "pass if you're above 18" all over it.

this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it. robin is somehow mystified by an elk-man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of druidism and outright satanic episodes. the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. this is barely watchable. and to top all the ridiculousness they kill robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor. some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show. if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and oppressed, watch the classic series or the newest from the bbc.

i'll say it again... one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most, favorite films - "excalibur". i was floored to see it got a grade of over six. this movie sucks. it looked terrible. it looked like it was shot in 18 days and boorman must've been sleeping when he directed this. arquette didn't do anything. just plain terrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only blemish in boorman's celebrated career.1/10!!!!!

this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end. ok, so i salute boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in burma, but that is all he achieves. about 10 minutes into the film i thought "oh no, here we go again", and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next 80 minutes or so. patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role, and her acting was wooden and unconvincing. mind you, being saddled with such an awfully conventional script, maybe boredom set in, and was such reflected on the screen. a lot of the film was just plain laughable. at one stage, arquette's elderly companion is shot, and he is prostrate on the ground. in the next scene, he is sprinting through the forest, obviously attempting to break the world 100 meters record! - or maybe he's just trying to run away from boorman!!. if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond rangoon on your vcr and you'll be snoring in no time. i very rarely critisize a film as heavily as this, but in this case it is completely justified.

well, i have been to a british university, in fact i went to the one in this very film, and it was nothing like that. this is a horrible, badly made and acted film. worst thing is, it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more that 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true british students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan. it says nothing about uni life, where was the bush diving, the tea drinking till 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics??? where was the diversity and fun? maybe i'm just being romantic, but i don't remember fresher's week being that awful, and i'm teetotal. and in the end the question still remains...a bed or a wardrobe?

this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen. i've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience. this isn't it. the "acting" is god awful and the plot non-existent.here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.1) a posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) the best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname "the brick". 3) a couple that shag too loudly. 4) the lad who gets all the girls 5) the lad from northern ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) mcdonalds in bed 7) curry every night for a week 8) student bashing, couple of my mates ended up in hospital 9) the discarded joint that started a fire. 10) the flood 11) the lad who wakes up on his floor to find that every item of furniture has be taken from his room.and if i can come up with that list in 5 minutes and from real life, i'm sure a couple of script writers can do better, a lot better.and for a film named after a sleeper song, where is the britpop soundtrack?

there are a lot of 'bad' films out there. tune in to channel 5 every night of the week and you might just be treated to a daily, shocking effort from one filmmaker or another. there are possibly films that have caused me more pain - were harder to sit through - than this, but in terms of writing, acting, direction, cinematography and the bare basics of cinema inbetweeners is a truly, truly appalling effort and should be avoided at all costs. the only laugh it gave me was in the behind the scenes documentary on the dvd, in which the film's geeky director darren fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the 'talent' to the project! never underestimate the power of self-delusion.darren fisher - britain's answer to edward d. wood jr.!

i am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie.i watched the film 9 years ago and i still remember how angry i felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess. i am a big fan of john boorman's work. i really like his movies. so i went to "beyond rangoon" with big expectations. but i felt like watching a dumb, cheap chuck norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out. even the soundtrack was very annoying.i can't believe that john boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done. i think the burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.

this hokey movie left me groaning after just about any exchange of dialogue or plot complication. patricia arquette, though pleasing to look at, gives a below par performance from her usual mediocrity. my friends and i have coined the phrase "beyond rangoon" to mean anything really bad. a lowpoint for boorman.

american tourist on package tour in asia suffering recent bereavement decides to break law by: 1 ignoring curfew; 2 joining revolutionary army; 3 possessing and using illegal firearm...... etc etc what is meant to be a political and educational statement about the so called atrocities of a military dictatorship in asia ends up as a "how to" travel guide for disillusioned americans....especially those who wish to protest that the water in the hotel does not work.... regrettably the authors of this silly yarn have no clue about asia...nor it seems in writing sensible dialogue... example:...our human-rights heroine searching desperately for medicine in the furthest outreaches of the asian jungle miles from anywhere comes across a peasant and asks: "excuse me-does this town have a pharmacy?"...well....those who know something about the asian jungle will appreciate how ludicrous that scenario really is.... mind you i was recently in the thai jungle and an american asked me.... "excuse me....do you know where is macdonalds?" this movie is meant to be a serious drama but ends up as a parody and rip-off of all those "killing fields" type of films designed to confirm tha asian stereotype held by much of western "civilization" and re-inforced by hollywood fantasies such as this..... the basic message of this picture is: "we americans...coming from the worlds only true democracy have a divine right to go to all other nations...and put right their wrongs.....screw-up their environment....and teach them about freedom....." (see for example the beach......at least leo did it with a bit more style)....of course vietnam is another story.... and.....the educated asian may well ask why the yankie gungh-ho attitude about asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity has been helping to spread cancer... aids.. gun carrying kiddies and jerry springer......et al.. at the end of this picture the cynical viewer may well be cheering for the burmese military..... 3 out of 10.

this movie has to rank with "welcome to the jungle" and "the hitcher" and "dream catcher" for sheer god-awfulness. you've got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time sobbing and wailing and shrieking--all the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film. why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained. even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her, she refuses to leave the crapper. when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue, the killer truck driver runs over the cop's legs while the heroine just looks on. instead of grabbing his gun for protection, she drags the poor slob into the crapper and locks the door. then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain. she does so--while wailing and sobbing and keening--and blows the back of his head off. then--the cop, still alive, beg her to shoot him again because he's still in pain. he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor. the sobbing, wailing heroine shoots him again. the movie goes on and on like this, none of it making any sense. the heroine is so dislikable you really want the killer to off her early on. i saw this flick on the sci-fi channel so it didn't cost me anything to watch, but still i did watch, out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad.

this movie is not a horror movie. there is nothing scary about it it's more of a torture flick. and it doesn't make sense to me, there is a few scene's with disappearing bodies. for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie. that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears. then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i don't think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didn't kill him? the at the end she sets the killer's truck on fire. that but he's not in it. he is standing behind her. then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie. save yourself some money and skip this movie.

we have given this film one star for awful, however, it really depends on how you look at it. we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 3.30am, and we haven't stopped laughing, so perhaps we could give it a 10, just for the entertainment value. right from the outset, with the 'manic' thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion, we were laughing. is it me or does that chick from knott's landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystal.i'm not going to spoil it for you, however, you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming, i don't think its clever enough for double bluffs.this has to be the worst/best film we have ever seen, if we'd been playing the 'spot the cliché' drinking game, then we be wasted by now.

i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long. we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.this film clearly falls into the garbage category.the director and writer is john shiban. it's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. maybe he wants two pay cheques. he shouldn't get any. so remember the name - john shiban. and if you see anything else by him, forget it.i won't say anything about the plot - others have already. i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl's face when she is crying and screaming. these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr. shiban. maybe he should get psychiatric help.enough already. it's crap - don't waste your time on it.

there are movies that are so bad, they're good. then there's movies like rest stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. i can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all i really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all. it's 1.5 hours of your life that you will never get back. 1/10

as horror films go, "rest stop", could have been better in many levels. director/writer john shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. unfortunately, either he was not sure as to what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended, either by the studio, or the backers. several endings have been included in the dvd, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best.the idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first. after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop, things get out of hand. poor nicole is left alone to fend for herself all the weirdos she finds along the way.it was clear when one started to hear "amazing grace" in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess desecrate their neck of the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not well appreciated by the natives.watch it at your own risk. there's a lot of gore for the aficionados of the genre.

a young couple decides to runaway to sunny california. they never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the rest stop.after a fight with her boyfriend, nicole carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. when she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company.rest stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. will rest stop become a cult classic you may ask? well the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are gore, sex and artistic merit. rest stop has bucket loads of gore, and while i do not want to give too much away, it contains oodles of blood-soaked nastiness. this movie has everything from the bad guy running over a cop's legs with his car several times to him making use of a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. at times, it can be about as bloody as a film can get. it also has a gratuitous and yet somehow quite intimate love scene in the opening minutes of the film. therefore, the sex is covered. now the hard one  does it have any artistic merit? you never get to see the bad guy's face  you see glimpses, profiles, shadowy silhouettes. he is a faceless, relentless, monster, which alone scores highly on the artistic merit scale. the movie has very few characters in it apart from the main protagonist  nicole carrow (jaimie alexander). since she spends a large part of the film on her own, she cannot reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation, but must speak them aloud so that we, the audience, know what she is thinking. at times, this can be slightly irritating; however, it is a brave step by the writer (john shiban) and it does work for the majority of the film. as an audience knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilisation is frightening enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers.so, will rest stop become a cult classic? it probably will because along the gore, sex and arguable artistic merit, it also has plenty of chills, an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouting at the screen as the main character does plenty of things you should definitely not do when running from a psychotic killer. (what fun are horror movies if you cannot complain about the stupidity of the victims?)

this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la, who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. actually, it's really just about the girl (nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. the movie gets going extremely fast, and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. it isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.the story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid, and incoherent. minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car, nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop. she sees the flashing of a camera, and knows that people are inside, but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks. after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, she walks around the rest stop, doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things. this includes turning on a tv (and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbled onto a porno movie, even in this dire situation), sitting around, wandering, and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end. she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted, that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her, and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety (she doesn't bother to lock the doors or remain alert). oh yeah, she tries using a radio to call for help, but why even bother when there's a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop? it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the story.there's no sense of entrapment or ever-present danger in this story. the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop, and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her, before driving off again. there's nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off (even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else, that's better than sitting around), but she chooses to stay anyway. at one point in the movie, the main character even acknowledges that she can run off, but doesn't.the story doesn't go anywhere, and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment. nicole finally gets inside the mobile home, and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered, presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics. they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killer's actions (but there's no indication that they're connected to him in any way), and then kick nicole out after several minutes.in the next irrelevant segment, the main character wanders into the bathroom building. she discovers one of the killer's previous victims (a young woman named tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. for some strange reason, tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood. nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door, and when she returns a minute later, both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation. what was the point? nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons, and sees that tracy had disappeared in 1971. so, was tracy a ghost or something? the writer never bothers explaining.next, a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop, which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far. nicole tells him all about what's been going on, and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office, the cop goes outside to confront him. what does the police officer do, knowing that something is seriously wrong? he goes up and calmly talks to the killer (who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her), and buys into the killer's lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions. seriously. the cop then talks to nicole outside, totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over.the cop quickly starts telling nicole that he's a goner who's "lucky to be breathing" still, yet he strangely doesn't die for quite a while. the two of them do some more pointless talking, and the all-important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time. when the two of them finally try to use the gun, nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it. with two bullets left, the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him. she fires one into his mouth, and he lays still for a few moments, with a chunk blown out of his head. then, he suddenly and inexplicably yells out "you missed!" and she has to shoot him again. completely cheap attempt at shock.nicole finally confronts the killerand fails. the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then, with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop. in the bathroom building, she hears nicole crying for help in the closet (locked in like tracy was). she gets a policeman to go inside and check it, but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet. the cop leaves, thinking he's been tricked. a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet (she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of 10 seconds looking), apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there. wow.this movie is apparently the first in a new line of "quality" direct-to-dvd movies, marketed as being too extreme for theaters. in reality, it's just more cliché, b-movie garbage.

this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment i've ever experienced with a film. the acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. i found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried. i'm dismayed that a sequel is planned, because it means they'll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line. if this is an example of raw feed's work, i think i'll be avoiding any and all future films by them.

there's something going on in this film directed by x-files scribe john shiban that has eluded me. you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems, yet i feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. it's about perception. there are characters the heroine nicole(jaimie alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. this might seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part. they seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not. it never gets a proper answer and i for one was a bit clueless at the point. there comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw..it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psycho-drama. now there's nothing wrong with ambiguity itself, but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us. that's how i felt as i watched "rest stop." this film is supposedly about a young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jesse(joey mendicino)to make it big in hollywood. they make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that nicole can pee, but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing. someone in a crusty, dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind jesse's disappearance when things start to occur, signs provided to her if you will, she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation. nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be.that's the easy part. when a female character comes into play, the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from, how she got there, and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restroom's utilities' cabinet. she meets another, a police officer in the area(joey lawrence), who might seem like her savior, but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with. the truck driver commits torturous acts to nicole(like holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock, she receives a nasty bite from him). he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast.it's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that has me listless. perhaps he just likes tormenting her, but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare. it doesn't make much sense, his motives, which propel the film into an illogical idea. why does he make himself so obvious? why does he allow her to prepare? it seems, i'm going out on a limb here, that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack. yet, why does shiban decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd meetings with people that don't exist? what is shiban and the writing team trying to say? and, to cap off the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in a rv. they play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves, but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all.

a young woman, nicole carrow (jaimie alexander), and her boyfriend, jess (joey mendicino) become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a 'comfort break' at a remote road-side rest-stop.what might have been an effectively scary chiller in more competent hands, turns out to be a confusing, ill-considered mess under the sloppy direction of john shiban (who also wrote the screenplay). there is a good deal of juicy violence, a brief smattering of nudity, and confident performances from the cast, but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions one cannot help but feel disappointed.on the surface, the film plays out like a standard cliché-ridden 'killer-on-the-loose' movie, but shiban (an ex-writer for the x-files) throws in some subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his aim was something else entirely: a ghost story, with the rest stop acting as home to a vengeful spectre out to punish sinners.by reading up on the film, checking out viewers' theories here on imdb, and watching the extras on the dvd, certain plot elements begin to make a little more sense (although, even with the advantage of extra information, there are still many questions left unanswered). in my opinion, any film that requires this much investigation to make itself (only partially) understood is not particularly a good one.

i've never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad i had to say something about it.i'm all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of hollywood's showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. that being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.the characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. the direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away. only one brief scene featuring a female's nude breasts, and even that wasn't worth a second look.the scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again. i gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it earns one point for each of those traits.

if you just want gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. if you want a at least a sliver of good acting, logic, story, consistencies, or even a good guy ending, go elsewhere.i couldn't help but to think to myself, "jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?" example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck. the yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks to it, talks to the guy and the truck drives off without any trouble. the actress comes out and says why didn't you arrest him? and then the truck runs over the police officer... after being rammed the truck stops on the road about 20 feet way just standing there while the actress tries to drag the cop away but he's too heavy. (at the time) at that time the truck backs up and runs over the cops leg twice. the truck then drives off. why didn't the actress get the gun is beyond me. (which later she shoots the cop in the head twice because the psychopath was about to burn him alive) once through the mouth, which didn't kill him (duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. *roll eyes* right after that, she turns away to escape the bathroom which was going to explode and when she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the cop isn't there anymore... ok...another example, the main actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom, she spits out like a gallon of blood on the floor, covering about 1/3s of the room. (probably more) after the main actress goes outside to grab a towel, she comes back in and everything is gone. :/ they don't explain why everyone keeps disappearing either. dumb dumb dumb.i like horror/thriller/gore movies, but this one was just way too dumb. i lost brain cells watching this dribble and you shouldn't too.

awful in a bad/good way...this movie has officially become the worst "made for tv movie" in my book...except for the camp value it offers, i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. suggestion: watch with friends, champagne and plenty of popcorn...you'll want to throw some at the screen! preferably friends who like chris noth from his 'sex in the city days'...this movie is dreadfully funny. this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members...honestly, i don't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered! daniel j. travanti is absolutely pathetic. everyone participated in the school of over acting; and poor joan van ark, i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously...she is credited as a producer though. her "mom" jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer's. this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot. this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as {with harmful intent}....has anyone else had the pleasure?

being a huge fan of conte d'ete ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/ ) i was expecting to be wowed by another french beach romance with a lot of honesty, realism, and humor. same director, same actress- what could go wrong? unfortunately, pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment. it's very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters, was meaningful, or original. but it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations. the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" with regards to pauline. the source material is standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach vacation) but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting. unfortunately that's not the case. event though there are other shortcomings with rohmer's season cycle, most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one.

well, i notice imdb has not offered any plot info...that's because it's not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting...because that's what this movie is...vile and disgusting !! i watched it because i am a humongous fan of chris noth, whom i have met in person and he is a great guy...but if i ever meet him again, i will have no qualms about asking him whatever posessed him to star in something so awful. he plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his spare time running over small children with his car, with the intent of maiming and crippling them...this is not a "spoiler", because all this is made very clear from the begining...sickening enough?? oh, it gets better...he is manipulated into doing this, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to with-hold sexual favors from him if their latest victim fails to die...even clive barker couldn't write anything so hideous. please, if you want to see chris noth in something worthy of his talent, rent "teddy roosevelt and the roughriders"

certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. this film is a perfect example. the critics like director eric rohmer.this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("pauline") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. it's talk, talk, talk and more talk. for those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play. a friend of mine loaned me this tape. he thought he was getting some sexy french film, and was disappointed. i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring. how this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable.

and totally non-scary film. the characters doesn't interest at all, and most of the time is spent in a car. the dog is at best ugly, never really scary. to interest, a more threatening menace would have been needed, at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you. and, not the least, something interesting must happen. something unexpected. as it is, this film just drags on and on, in what seems like forever. maybe a saint bernhard was not that smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and society?in most scary movies/thrillers/mystery, just whatever genre, there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens. here you really don't care, you just wait for it all to stop, and wondering if it wouldn't be better to see something else. one of the weakest king adaptations.

cujo is a giant, lovable, gentle and affectionate st. bernard owned by the camber family, during the opening sequence cujo chases a rabbit over fields and through a local wood somewhere in castle rock, maine. the rabbit disappears into a burrow and cujo sticks his head into the entrance hole. the rabbit vanishes from cujo's sight, angry cujo starts to bark and in doing so inadvertently wakes up and annoy a colony of bats, one of which bites him on the nose. donna trenton (dee wallace-stone as dee wallace) is having an affair with steve kemp (christopher stone, dee wallace's real life husband) which her husband vic (daniel hugh kelly) who works in advertising, discovers. obviously their relationship becomes strained. happily oblivious to all of this is their young son tad (danny pintauro). joe camber (ed lauter) fixes cars for a living out of his barn on his farmhouse. joe is planning a guys weekend with one of his friends gary pervier (mills watson) when his wife charity (kaiulani lee) wins $5,000 on the lottery and decides to take their young boy brett (billy jayne as billy jacoby) with her on a trip to see her parents. arriving at gary's house to pick him up joe finds him dead on the floor, he goes into the kitchen to call for help and his dog cujo who is now rabid attacks and kills him. donna and tad drive to the camber's farmhouse to try and get her car repaired. the place is deserted except for cujo who is now completely rabid, foaming at the mouth, his fur stained red with blood and maddened by pain. cujo attacks the car to try and get at donna and tad, luckily for them the windows hold firm, at least for the time being anyway. donna tries to start the car but it has completely broken down, they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come and rescue them. cujo lies in wait, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. directed by lewis teague i thought the film was a bit slow for my tastes. the first half plods along, the second half builds up a head of steam but i still felt it was a little underwhelming and unexciting. the acting is fine by everyone involved, i've no complaints there. technically the film is ok, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's generally well made. the big problem is the script by don carlos dunaway and lauren currier and in particular it's first half, most of which appears to be padding to stretch the run time out. clocking in at just under the 90 minute mark it felt longer. it's also a little predictable as well. cujo as a monster never really scared me either, i just don't find slobbering overweight st. bernards scary i guess. i suppose there's nothing really wrong with it, but i don't think i'd be in a hurry to see it again. average, not too bad if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on t.v. for free.

not me.. if it came down to it, i could kick a dog's ass, and that's why this movie doesn't work for me. if it was me against the alien, or jason.. or.. hell, i dunno.. any other horror movie antagonist, then there'd be no contest and i'd have my ass handed to me barring divine intervention. a horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, person, being, entity, whatever, that is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than they are, and then people think 'well what if that happened to me', and they get scared - and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story. i can't imagine myself being terrorized by a dog, so i'm not scared.

man, i just cant believe this movie. i have watched it entirely (believe me, i have done this !) and the best part was the traillers on the beginning (and i hate traillers!!!!).no plot, no acting, no nothing. i was watching the movie and thinking, "when this is going to start" ? it never started. how people can spend money and time to make such a crap ?the "plot": a dog gets bitten by a bat and get rabies - okay, until now no problem, nothing special but ok. now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people!!! thats it, nothing else!!! now add to this some of the worse actings/actors i have ever seem, some completely irrealistic scenes (and some others really idiotic, like the child cant breath and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better), and a very lame ending, thats it, here you have crap... ops!.... cujo.do your self a favor and make something more worthy, like hiting your head against the wall or play chess with yourself.zero out of 10.gabriel.

don't get me wrong, i love stephen king! and this is a pretty good movie over all. the rabid cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. but after the first few minutes that poor donna and her little son tad were held captive in their pinto by the rabid st. bernard, i began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.she could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (i mean, it was a pinto for pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. when she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? no, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. she did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time! i mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. but, forget the bat. were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? i didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?at the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by god she was still wearing high heels!

1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen. christine, the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other. while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch, christine and cujo were both pretty bad, and it's a close-run thing as to which is the lesser of the two. if pushed for an answer i'd say cujo - marginally - is the weakest.donna trenton (dee wallace, fresh from success as elliot's mom in "e.t - the extra terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to husband vic (daniel hugh-kelly) is hanging by a thread. she's been having an affair with a local worker, and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband. dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton (danny pintauro), son of donna and vic, and a pretty messed-up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks. donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics' yard for repairs, but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt. things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic, joe camber (ed lauter), isn't there (he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo, a gigantic st. bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) soon, the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims. the weather is swelteringly hot; not a living soul knows they're there; the car won't start; and the dog seriously wants their blood......cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller, but it never really clicks into gear. i've read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for king - so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little. on the printed page, king was at least able to generate a degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st. bernard simply isn't very scary. the "visualness" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st. bernard. in the book, it was possible to forget this. in the book, cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster. even with the relatively short running-time of an hour-and-a-half, cujo becomes a tedious and patience-straining experience, occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be. they've even omitted the book's cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an "all's well that ends well" conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood!!! chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation.

my mom would not let me watch this film when i was in grade 2, because she said it was too violent. well, years later, and the only reason i remember this film is because of my mom, i stayed up and watch it on pbs. well, maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big disapointment of this film, but i found it lame. it did not age well, and this made the acting choppy, huge unbelievable holes in the script, but there is a few cool scenes like car chases, and a big gun fight. i will not stay up for this film again.

i don't know if this exceptionally dull movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to 'the french connection", but it does have many of the same drawbacks: the script is so confusing that the viewer remains uninvolved and feels left out of the picture, and the direction is so cold, so lacking in energy, that even the great chase sequence can't liven things up. (*1/2)

with hong kong heart-throb andy lau and veteran star ching wan lau, "aau chin" has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie, unfortunately, the movie falls apart at the end.andy lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live, but still has one thing unfinished... he pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him... however, the police is hot on his tail.... can he pull it off before being caught?the build up of the movie is good. bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention. unfortunately, the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown. it feels as if in the middle of the script, the writer has changed and that all the build-up becomes disconnected.a 3/10 ....

the main character of this sex-filled drivel, mel (ethan hunt), notes on several occasions, "she deserves better than this!" the "she" he refers to is ginger, played by beautiful brandy davis, who indeed does deserve better than this. brandy deserves better than this film, its lame script, and perverted mel. a guy who gets off at watching his dream girl have sex with another man, even in virtual world, seriously does not deserve her at all. an a- for the simulated sex scenes, an f for the script.

... and boy is it soft i saw this on cable channel bravo one saturday night and here in britain we often have these dire " erotic " soft core movies turning up late at night on bravo . this one follows a weird science type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies . when you`ve seen one of these movies you`ve seen them all with a bunch of bimbos looking like they`re advertising silicone implants . come on i`ve actually seen breasts in real life ( i`m sure some other of us have too ) and they wobble around unlike here where they defy the laws of , if not physics than at least gravity . the sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well buffed geezer rubs himself against his co-star without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they climax it looks like they`re both having a bad attack of constipation . the girls themselves are very pretty especially brandy davis and nikki fritz but they`re wasted in these type of soft core movies and if it`s fantasy you`re after i recommend the lord of the rings trilogy

director j.s. cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy, but nothing more. a widowed mother karen tunny(lori heuring)inherits a home in the pennsylvania mountains; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere. but it is somewhere, somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and dank. the area and especially the tunny estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny little wicked souls. the legend is the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge; and you better believe it. also in the cast: ben cross, scout taylor-compton, chloe moretz, julie rogers and geoffrey lewis.

this movie is very much like every other modern horror movie. it's predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen. that's really the biggest disappointment of the movie, that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort.you can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie cliché. it has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch. one of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid. why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies? same goes for the sort of drama aspects, that involves the family. it just doesn't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. it often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch. so it has all of the clichés present but it also doesn't succeed at bringing any of these clichés well to the screen. as an horror movie this simply is a very poor one. it doesn't handle its horror or tension very well. for the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. the movie its story isn't too well connected and build up within the movie. too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn't ever allow its horror to fully kick in.the movie is also often way too dark (no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget) and it shows very little gore as well, mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well.you can just tell by looking at this movie that director j.s. cardone doesn't has much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to handle its present ingredients properly. he did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far. he just keeps trying unfortunately. who knows, perhaps with the right people behind the camera's (like tobe hooper, who was initially attached to direct) this movie still could had been something decent.it's a poorly cast movie, with mostly big unknowns in it. biggest name of the movie is ben cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story. it didn't even seemed like he had much fun playing.just skip it.4/10

this starts off in pennsylvania in 1913. a bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion purposely set off by the mine's owner. cut to 2006. recently widowed karen (lori heuring), her teenage daughter sarah (scout taylor-compton) and little girl emma (chloe moretz) move to a remote house located near that mine. what they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark.slow and boring "horror" movie. the premise is obvious and has been done to death already. also there are huge gaps in logic in the story. it's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody or why they eat the bodies afterwards (yes--it's shown). they're dead already--why do they need food? and why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before? he was around the area. why pick this time to attack him? also the characters aren't the least bit likable. sarah comes across the worst. it has a few saving graces. the location is beautiful and eerie at the same time, some of the killings were very bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked spooky silently walking through the woods at night. but, all in all, i was bored and fighting to stay awake. you can skip this one.

julie andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she's alone in doing so. blake edwards' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and german spy during wwi doesn't know what tone to aim for, and rock hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle. musicals had grown out of favor by 1970, and elephantine productions like "star!" and this film really tarnished andrews' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until "the tamarind seed" came along. i've always thought julie andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention, and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive. husband/director edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor julie can work up much energy within this scenario. screenwriter william peter blatty isn't a good partner for edwards, and neither man has his heart in this material. beatty's script offers andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease. *1/2 from ****

wicked little things (known in australia as "zombies") is a rare find  a film that promises one thing but delivers another. it is one of the few genre films to be made by millennium pictures, a european film studio known for making various b-grade action films & thrillers, some featuring action star jean-claude van damme.karen tunny & her two daughters sarah & emma arrive in the pennsylvanian town of addytown in order to move into a large house that karen's late husband owned after finding a miner's deed in his effects. once arriving, they find that the house is very old & in need of repair. but the house's condition is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances & karen is confronted by the area's owner & ordered to move out. once night falls, the tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings: a group of zombie children, killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, come out to kill anything that goes in the woods. with the help of a grizzled neighbour, karen attempts to end the curse before her & her children become the next victims.i bought the dvd expecting a film with flesh-eating zombies, but was let down by one thing: the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick, with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods, taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed  the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals & are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic & mirrors  aren't these kids supposed to be zombies?). the plot as such would not be a problem & would actually be entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film, only to fall flat on their faces with this effort.as such, a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but, due to a poor script, becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort. the film's greatest strength is the acting, with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves. of particular note is scout taylor-compton, who does her role quite well  it's a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the halloween remake (or maybe it's just rob zombie's script).

having spent all of her money caring for her terminally ill spouse, recently widowed karen tunny (lori heuring) moves with her two daughters sarah (scout taylor-compton) and emma (chloe moretz) to her late husband's run-down family home in rural pennsylvania, where local legends speak of zombies who roam the woods at night.just seeing the names of this film's writer and director in the opening credits was enough to send shivers up my spine: boaz davidson is the 'genius' responsible for penning the scripts for such stv titles as octopus 1 & 2, spiders and crocodile, whilst j.s. cardone gave us the godawful 'video nasty' the slayer and dull vampire flick the forsaken. with such dubious talent responsible, i didn't expect much from wicked little things.and having just finished the film, i'm glad i kept my expectations low.although the movie looks good at times, with lovely use of the eerie woodland locale, and the cast give reasonable performances given the clichéd drivel that they are working with, the plot is so laboured, poorly written, and derivative that it's impossible to be enthusiastic about. most importantly, perhaps, the film's killers, undead children who rise each night from the mine in which they died, aren't in the least bit scary, a smudge of makeup, black contacts and some crappy joke shop scars doing very little to add to the sense of menace. scout taylor-compton and company do their best to look afraid of the tiny terrors, screaming convincingly with every confrontation, but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience is to little avail: the little blighters just ain't got what it takes to chill the blood.there are a few lacklustre zombie chow scenes in a futile bid to win over gore-hounds, and the final kill, which sees the victim's blood drench both compton and heuring, is suitably tasteless, but on the whole, wicked little things (aka zombies in the uk) is instantly forgettable trashjust another clunker in the filmographies of cardone and davidson.

i can't believe that i let myself into this movie to accomplish a favor my friends ask me early this april 14, 2007. this movie certainly a pain in your ass in theater and sickly boring, i haven't even felt the gory impact of its "daunting scenes" which i deem to be complete failure to attract its audience. the worst even trampled me, cause my friend failed to come on time at the theater because she was busy assisting her boyfriend in looking for an appropriate lodge to stay in for one night. i wasn't really disappointed with that matter, but this movie is a matter indeed for me, poor plot, useless storyline, naively created and i don't know what to say anymore.the title doesn't suggest anyway the creeps and horror it failed to overture us viewers, maybe the beating of the animals could get more the creeps if they show it in theaters the real situational play. good luck to anyone who attempts to watch it anyway.

child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive & controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to revolve on this topic should receive some extra attention from horror fans. of course, like in the case of "wicked little things", controversial themes don't always guarantee a good film. despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric setting and the involvement of video-nasty director j.s. cardone ("the slayer"), this is an uninspired and cliché-ridden film that couldn't offer a single fright or shock. after losing their husband and father, the remaining tunny women (mother karen and her daughters sarah and emma) move to a small and remote pennsylvanian mountain town where they inherited an old, ramshackle mansion. their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. strange things start to happen, like young emma befriending an (imaginary?) girl who used to live in their house, and the eerie locals seem to keep secrets from karen and her daughters. quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine-graves at night to seek vengeance on the descendants of the mine's owner mr. carlton, who was responsible for their deaths. "wicked little things" is rather tame and extremely predictable. the script shamelessly serves one dreadful cliché after the other, like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times, malfunctioning flashlights and horridly broken dolls. there's very little suspense, even less gore and the make-up effects are disappointingly weak. the zombified children don't look menacing at all. actually, they all look like miniature versions of marilyn manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. the excitement-free finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production. lori heuring is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother, but scout taylor-compton (currently a big star thanks to the "halloween" remake) and young chloe moretz are adequate as the daughters.

j.s. cardone directed a little known 'video nasty' in 1982 called "the slayer" and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films; including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie the forsaken. his latest feature film, wicked little things, boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct. well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie 'mortuary' and so turned this one down. i don't blame him for it either. the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. however, what they don't realise is that around a hundred years earlier; a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft. naturally, that's not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge the film is essentially a collection of clichés; from the youngest kid with an "imaginary friend", the mother who dismisses it and all the usual zombie rubbish. j.s. cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes (mostly involving kids) but its not enough. the story doesn't play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier mortuary, and that's not a good thing (although mortuary is actually a better film than this one). the acting is nothing to write home about either; lori heuring is decent looking, as is eldest daughter scout taylor-compton; but neither manages to provide an interesting performance. chloe moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor. the plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay can't even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals. it all boils down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall i have to say that if you know your horror movies, then you can feel free to skip this one!

i really wanted to like this movie. a film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film. unfortunately, the film was in the bottom 3 of films played at horror fest.a mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husband/father had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. they have to adapt to their new environment. they end up struggling due to all the surroundings for different reasons.(crazy zombie kids go into this category) the film never gives any sentimental attachment for anyone that lives or dies, the film produces no scares or jump worthy moments, the film barely shows the children doing what they're supposed to do...kill! with a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope. until then, pass on it.3.5/10 actually.

in yet another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie dvd set called "women who kick butt", but even in its original cover it seems to promise shannon tweed in an action role. actually, during most of the movie tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead, and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him! there is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie. the male lead is reb brown, and he does have some (unintentionally, i think) funny moments (like when he gets electrocuted). the action scenes are badly directed and poorly acted: some of the stuntmen needed a few lessons on "how to get shot and die convincingly". i suppose if you're in the right mood you can find some things in "firing line" to laugh at (at one point, we can hear tweed speaking but her lips are not moving!), but mostly i was just bored.

audio:seriously i've never seen a movie with worse audio. there are scenes where people are walking through the grass, and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps. they must be miking their feet. you know how in some movies they forget a line, so they have to dub it in on a shot of the back of someone's head. here the editors were not that clever. there is actually a scene where shannon tweed's character says her line without moving her lips at all!i'm pretty sure for their background sound they played effects loops live while shooting, because in a lot of scenes the sound effects will either be different or be absent whenever the camera changes angles.i could write a lot more on how bad the audio is in this movie.other nuggets:in this movie they probably consider the opening credits to be special effects because they seemed so challenging to produce. the main title and the first few names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky, and they wobble as if they were carefully hand painted on each frame.the reuse of extras in this movie is incredible. there are about 15 rebels in the cast, and yet in any given battle thirty or more of them will be killed. if only the film were high enough quality to distinguish which ones were dying over and over.it's also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet away. there is one scene one scene when some of the rebels are running out of their huts in the rebel base, and one huts shakes as the rebel exits the door. it makes you wonder if the hut will last long enough to encounter the inevitable explosion.there is a blue helicopter that looks as menacing as a pair of running shorts, but somehow is equipped with an infinite supply of missiles. when they show the missiles being shot out of the helicopter's missile bays, the often shoot of in unpredictable directions very closely resembling large bottle rockets. they still manage to hit their targets with ease, which as noted above is always a very safe distance away from the rebels they kill. note the recycled footage of the pilot pressing the live button to fire the missiles (because it's printed vertically, the first few times we saw it, we read it as the "evil" button).notice how the grenade launcher they use, produces identical explosions to those that are created by the helicopter missiles. it's also fun in many scenes how the actor in the foreground is shooting in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers that he is killing. and frequently, characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets to the soldiers who are killed (like when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemies).yes this movie is very very very bad. the plot was thought out almost as well as a 5 year old's soccer game, and the editing is the worst i've ever seen. but honestly, sometimes it's fun spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who sincerely took part in such a terrible movie.

what a shocker. for starters, i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. the jerky camera movements were also annoying. the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. and then there's the ending. i'm still not really sure what to make of it. i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.the case had a couple of those little award winner/nominations symbols on it, so i figured it couldn't be too bad. i was wrong. if you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.

if you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. i wasted enough time myself watching it, so i will waste no more explaining why it is so awful. be warned!!! oh, i see that i have to fill 10 lines or more. here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground, that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit. the cavern is one of those. i didn't have high expectations about this one but the acting is so bad and the production so poor that i'm seriously thinking of asking for a refund. phewww ... one more line about a useless movie ... oh, i'm done.

a virtual carbon copy of the cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. i knew the movie was going downhill when i saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. the conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. the acting wasn't as bad as the typical b movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. overall not worth wasting $4.50 to rent.

this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen. on a par with blair witch and just as annoying. the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out. then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something. she can really hear something. one of these guys must have at least seen scream (where they draw your attention to such things) it is also a big let-down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script. so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back.

when i sat down to watch this movie i thought that it might be slightly good. but no. it was a ok film, not good, but not bad for most of it but then you get to the ending and it losses all credibility. they should have just left then dead. they did not leave the last bit it did not make any sense. if they had something at they beginning about a plane crash yeah but we didn't so it didn't work. the first bit is ok and i give them credit for that but the rest is just plane bad and unnecessary if you are thinking about going and watching this movie don"t it is awful go and rent something that is actually worth watching. i give it 2/10

there seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if i hadn't actually started watching it.to begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out "look there!" we are left to beg "what?! where?!". ultimately the film has a nauseating, confusing strobe-light effect, with no sense to it until we get to the end.and i won't tell you what 'the end' means - but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old early '60s arch hall laugh fest"eegah!" with richard kiel.but what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like "eegah!"'s, long remembered as one of the worst films ever made?! but that's what we have here, folks. except that, unlike "eegah!", "the cavern" is not anyone's idea of goofy fun. it is unwatchable. (i ran it at x2 the normal speed, just to get it over with, hoping i would actually be able to see something by the end of the film; but when i did, it was just stupid.) this film did provide me with one satisfying moment, though; since it only cost a couple bucks, after i got it out of the dvd player, i was able to smash it with my own hands - what a relief!

this show started out okay, but then it turned into a nightmare. the worst part about it was the contestants. most of them were weirdos. they did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. in the second season, one guy said he that he talked to his pants. that is sick and repulsive. also, no one cared about winning money. all they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was "survivor" or something. the men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together. the women were the same also. i just couldn't take it anymore. i had to stop watching it. it was truly one of the worst shows ever.

the summary was promising but watching the movie was a huge disappointment. nothing happens in this movie. plot is linear and without surprise. normal characters stay normal until end of the film, weird characters stay weird until end of the film. there is even not a single tentative to foul the viewer into thinking that the bad guy is someone else than the most obvious candidate. on the positive side, actors play quite well, and there is a tiny bit of atmosphere in the movie, but much too little to be any significant.people who vote 10 for this movie either didn't see it, or are member of the movie production team ! 4 is well paid.

i mean, come on! this movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. they also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. it's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.i was really hoping this would be a good movie. there was some good acting. mark hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart, so does sally struthers. it was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft. majandra delfino was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable. i felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers. brad hunt does an excellent job. he really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies i recently saw, lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). this guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director.almost forgot! the music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored. i call this kind of music "teller music" because you can just tell what's coming next based on the music. less is more sometimes.cut half of the music from this movie, get a good film editor, a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie.

i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand. what i found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people i know.great moments between characters  including many of temuera morrison and lawrences makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through. beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rattled away from lawrence in particular as if he were the new maori messiah at his pulpit of beer crates.when watching any film with maori actors, i've found that i can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. with crooked earth i struggled to find one key character that rung true for the entire two hours. most  including wiremu and peka  wound up saying or doing things that i didn't understand and couldn't connect with. by the end of the movie the writer had succeeded in alienating the audience where the maori weren't able to relate to it and the pakeha were therefore given license to dismiss it. my feeling is that the movies message  or at least the main one of several that was being lobbed at the audience  is important enough to avoid using character extremities. unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to pass this piece of advice on.the soundtrack was invasive, and, as irritating as that horrible `bing-bong' noise that they laced through `eyes wide shut'. the audience was not so subtly auto-cued to laugh, cry or be angry when the music changed. it reminded me of darth vader's entrance music in star wars: obvious and mildly amusing.i think that there are some people out there that might enjoy this film. it's funny in parts, has a fair amount of action and has some really powerful scenes. calvin tuteao and quentin hita did bang up jobs as well. as a whole though, i didn't enjoy the experience as much as i know i should have. barb wire, speed 2, the island of dr moreau and crooked earth look like they're going to be tem's quartet of crap.

i went to see this on the strength of albert finney alone. he's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. i'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! this sends god and the whole human being factory into a crisis and albert finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born. so finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the big apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live.despite the ridiculousness of the plot, i could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical hollywood sentimental moralistic message film. directorially, the film was rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that hollywood directors seem incapable of resisting.he further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away its hand at every moment. whatever twists and turns were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled. it was as if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiots who cannot see the obvious hints coming from a mile away.even finney in his performance, though satisfactory, seemed a bit awkward and out of place; and the little boy with curly locks, though he was supposed to be cute, was in fact rather dull. bridget fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate demi moore's performance in 'ghost', shedding tears at a moment's notice.i understand that the film has been unsuccessful thus far at getting distribution in the u.s., which surprises me as i think it has the box office potential to be a modest hit, appealing to both kids and sentimental adults. as far as the quality goes, it's not an awful film, it's just not very good. (4 out of 10)

i went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on vhs. being a big gloria grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. other than that, i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. the plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. ms. grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as i do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot. she works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. it can only lend to the atmosphere. i must agree with an earlier reviewer; the ending borrows heavily from the big heat. to the point of detracting from the ending. i have seen worse films with ms. grahame (macao), but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen. if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. enjoy the picture.

has this ever happened to you? i go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the "film noir" section. i spy a copy of a new arrival of a film i have never seen called naked alibi. its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) "dupey" looking copies of hard to find titles. the description on the box sounds good. the film has players i like (sterling hayden, gloria grahame, and gene barry). so i take it home and watch it. about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts. about half way through this film i started to dislike it. by the time the film ended, i not only disliked it, i despised it. the film opens with cops questioning al willis on suspicion of robbery. other than being drunk, the police have nothing on him. when he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home, the cops beat him up. detective conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces willis is in the clear. willis swears he will get revenge. later one of the police officers is shot dead. with no evidence other that willis is "sore" about the beating, conroy make willis his sole suspect, despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects. conroy arrests him, but for lack evidence willis is released. the next day two more cops are killed by a bomb. this time conroy goes to the bakery that willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him. conroy doesn't know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of conroy trying strangle willis and conroy is fired. but conroy continues his pursuit and willis flees to mexico where willis has a mistress. conroy manages to convince his mistress (who willis treats rather rough) to help him prove willis is a killer. what this film lacks is a convincing script. the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed. things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it. other than the fact that willis likes to tip a glass now and than, there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife. he treats his wife, his kid and employees well. early in the film, one gets the impression that its conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon. he seems to casually approve of police brutality. conroy, for no reason is convinced from the very start willis has criminal past. he seems to operate on the motto of the old communist bulgarian secret police; "everyone is guilty of something, we just have not found out about it yet." later conroy shows kindness to al's mistress and young son, now we are supposed to like him. sorry! the early impression i got of conroy stuck with me too long. and he is also a dumb cop. only after he is fired and goes to mexico does he run a background check on willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in maryland. why didn't he think of this before? because this film hadn't used up enough running time. the cast is good. gene barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of al willis is. i'm big fan of 40's and 50's crime thrillers but not only did i not think this film was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern films do, but older films rarely do).

gordon scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin english has to be the worst of all the tarzans. as for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. i've seen used car dealers in tv commercials who can act better. they make clayton moore look like laurence olivier! and where does jane (the dull eve brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? i realize these were made for kids but wow! the plot line seemed ok but the director should have required more from his actors. i realize even the weissmuller films have a few flaws but this one seemed so "low budget".

tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, faces four trappers who by most unorthodox means abduct animals to get them to zoos. tarzan has a bland but sexy enough wife with an impeccable hairdo, and a kid. no one should fault tarzan for being grieved by the vicious actions of the hunters.this gordon scott tarzan flick is one of the silliest, completely and unnecessarily silly; for one reason or another, the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie, and so it's just some silly rubbish. tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers ,because tarzan's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the evildoers. the kid and the chimpanzee, both belonging to tarzan, are kidnapped by the malevolent trappers; so tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the chimpwith tarzan leading the attack. tarzan and the trappers is silly, unappealing, quite uninteresting. maybe as a kid i would have liked it? now one has to be too meanas viciously mean as those pathetic trappers punished by tarzanto ask a tarzan flick not to be silly; this i concede. but one is also truly entitled to ask these tarzan flicks, however silly, to have and to show some gustoa bit of gustoeven a tiny bit of gusto. some kick, some excitement, some fun. now the gordon scott tarzan failure is too silly exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all, of lacking all excitement. (yes, i liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake. what beast? watch the movie, kiddos, now here i just gave you one excuse to do so.) for one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and elicit mercy rather than virtuous anger.the books leave the impression that tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or another sportsman to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding, next to impossible task, gordon scott was anyway too far from meeting that ideal.the wife chides tarzan for disliking books.the script suggests tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate, and adverse to learning; but the book says otherwise, and we know that tarzan studied much, by himself, using the books of his gone family, before even meeting white people.and i did not like that yell.(it's supposed, dear kiddos, to be a genuine wild yell, not a missed yodeler.)

gordon scott made some good tarzan movies, but this is not one of them.as i watched it, wincing at the bad, obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden "clonking" sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails, and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast, i kept thinking, "sheesh! this is tv show level!" then i find out it was, indeed, three tv show pilot episodes woven seam-fully into one.it's nice to see scott get outside (alone), away from the lame sets, in a few of the scenes; and the fights do have some pretty nice moves... but oh, ow, and ouch as to the dialog. and did i mention the acting? heck, cheetah (or "cheta," in this version) was a better actor than most of the humans.and that's not saying much.it is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman (i.e. scatman) carothers acting as a native. but probably not worth the overall time-investment.

i share the same opinion regarding underworld as the previous comment.i sat through the 1.5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author and/or director had made certain decisions for the plot. on the whole i found the movie to be unbalanced, consisting of strange sub-plots which (imho) actually had nothing to do with the movie. furthermore, when writing a thriller i'd say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed...

this movie is an obvious rip-off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson. you owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. i'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. with everyone else getting killed, all through the movie i wondered why frank didn't just blow johnny's brains out. he certainly could have and johnny sure didn't act like someone that could be trusted. another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; why do these people have sex with their clothes on? is that supposed to turn us on? surely they didn't think they had a shot at a pg rating. nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally. as if one were watching people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy-handed and shallow manner.

this movie was in my opinion very ignorant! there is only foolishness as the motivation of the caracters. the police procedure was unrealistic. the caracters generated no sympathy from me,the story must have been written as the movie was filmed. unless you like police bashing stories don`t waste your time.

what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr. doing in this? light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. while the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. the characters are cutouts from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the faculty. watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. with them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems. for anyone older, it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning, as i did recently on bravo. matter of fact, what was this doing on bravo?

i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. i guess i didn't feel really for the kids. i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are, but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. if this comes on tv, don't waste your time. watch short circuit again for the 235th time.

*hannibal spoilers* hannibal lecter (anthony hopkins) is back... for a travesty of a movie! now he's in italy, appreciating our food (including people, such as rinaldo pazzi (giancarlo giannini)), but comes back to the states for clarice (julianne moore) and to even the score with a former victim, mason verger (gary oldman).let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the lambs and manhunter, because it's truly, completely, absolutely, totally bad.i mean, the scene near the end with ray liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain sautéed? wtf? then, why the hell was everybody so annoying (including clarice)? and why did the story keep going nowhere? i suppose that this is the 'teen' chapter of the hannibal series; terrible, stupid, gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing.don't watch it, especially if you love any other of the hannibal movies (sotl, manhunter, red dragon, hannibal rising).hannibal: 1/10.

hannibal must be the most god-awful movie i have seen in a long time. in fact, i want my money back. what a waste of time. no plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. what else can i say? if you haven't seen it don't bother. i wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv... change the channel. the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it). if you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.what was the purpose of this movie? its like someone just asked 'i wonder what hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. he is free in the beginning and he's free at the end. in between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers. julianne moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as i'm concerned she was set up to fail.in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.i give it a big fat raspberry!

synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed silence of the lambs, hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad sfx. why so many people in this forum are claiming that h is "not all bad" and "worth watching on the big screen", etc., is beyond me; and it is not "so bad it's good" either, it is just plain boring. i normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case i have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from shine - ola. maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a ridley scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous ac fans. h is totally devoid of suspense; instead we get endless scenes of lecter swanning through an english - speaking firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing h, i actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when i wrote them down i quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop). rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, i would advise you to wait until it comes on tv in a couple of years; and then to go to bed early.1 / 10.below are a couple of extra bones i have to pick with hannibal:- h _is_ the sequel to sotl, despite what some people in this forum are claiming. and even though sotl was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (sotl itself was the sequel to michael mann's "manhunter", based on thomas harris' "red dragon", and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, sotl was even better; another example would be the alien series initiated by h's director ridley scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels). in any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.- this movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as sotl, the cast is strictly a - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church. so what went wrong? i think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, dino delaurentiis. here is my interpretation: ddl produced "manhunter", which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop. disappointed, he gave the rights for the hannibal lecter character to orion -- for free, allowing jonathan demme to make sotl, and the rest is cinema history. ddl then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until thomas harris finally came up with the sequel novel. i think at this point ddl had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.- another aspect that i find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media; i mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity. and while most reviewers harp on about how dantesque the scenes in firenze are and why jodie foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is an utter, utter, utter flop goes unmentioned. but there is more: not only is hannibal being hyped through the roof, it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of "documentaries" (usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of sotl) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling. however, not only does h not even pretend to be realistic; lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help clarice starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know hl, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: lecter feeds the drugged - up paul krendler his own brain, so that makes it (erm) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism. try making a documentary out of that.- much has been said about the acting: mainly whether julianne moore can replace jodie foster, and anthony hopkins (who plays the lead hannibal lecter) is usually given a lot of praise. i think all of these discussions are moot. there are several of my favourite actors in this movie (namely liotta, oldman and moore) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with. same for hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way. and by the way, he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies, only that in h he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 million to do it.

i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. in the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. hannibal was not an exception. i wasn't expecting much, when i went in to see the movie. the book was ridiculous, and the saying, "the book is always better than the movie" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. but what i came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison. usually, when i see a terrible movie, i find myself more amused than anything else. sadly though, i could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that hannibal is. the movie was filmed with promise, i guess. it had anthony hopkins, julianne moore, and gary oldman. and for directing, there was ridley scott. there have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. there was so much i would have cut from this film that i doubt anything would have remained. it was pathetic. the storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. what's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where***spoiler ahead*** ray liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. that scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. silence of the lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. but hannibal was a two hour plus joke. this movie should only be watched, if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.

hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). minor spoilers follow...this movie has huge logic holes - more than any bruckheimer/bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of hollywood exaggeration. it's a slick hollywood production designed to cash in on hannibal lector mania, directed by "so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously" hack director ridley scott and produced by a hack italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is "doesn't matter whether film is s**t, money is good".i can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters david mamet and steven zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author thomas harris. david and steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. another factor in the disappointment of this film.there are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. starling/pazzi cell-phone in the midst of lecter pursuit that turns up inspector pazzi as the victim. not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by tony hopkins with a smirk and julianne moore, ray liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face. hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" along with hammy acting by gary oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against lecter.the gore effect is good, but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from hannibal. the predecessor - silence of the lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. suspense is what made silence of the lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tensely directed. the "brain dinner" sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.the ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you? ooh, scary... 

a typical old b&w film. the dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second half - they get naive, sometimes awfully naive, occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical. the first third, with its background information on ladd's gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the movie. but once gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on betty field, the film gets overly melodramatic. the ending is yet another cop-out ending; i don't know whether the novel itself contains this dumb, clichéd ending or whether the movie's producer made some changes to it, but i've always considered car-accidents to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. i've seen this plot-device a million times (or if it's not a car, then it's a fall from a horse); the writer doesn't know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic, so he adds in a car-accident. lame. and to make things worse, the accident is outrageously coincidental and preposterous, both plot-wise and time-wise; plot-wise because field's husband's mistress (winters) gets killed by field, and the fact that winters sort of rushes out from the gas-station into the street as though she'd never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house - and, of course, at the very moment that she comes out she sees ladd's car and mistakes it for field's husband's car and then shouts "over here! i'm here! run me over and make the ending tragic that way!"; time-wise because ladd and field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell field's husband about their affair. basically, there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. it also doesn't exactly help this movie how winters's husband, da silva, goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife; he basically does this by walking around like a zombie, going from car to car looking for scratches, and acting very badly indeed. both da silva's acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing, respectively.scott fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by hollywood's screenwriters, and - although he was dead long before this movie was done - he might have been right to complain, judging by this film's naive script. or, maybe his novels are even sillier and more naive than this film, and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations. or, the films are pretty much like the novels. i could, of course, read this particular novel to find out, but i just can't be bothered. fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and i don't mean the way his name sounds.) he was certainly no heller, clavell, or twain. more like hemingway  a lot of noise about nothing.

leslie nielson is a very talented actor, who made a huge mistake by doing this film. it doesn't even come close to being funny. the best word to describe it is stupid!

do not see "mr. magoo." it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. leslie nielson was not funny in it. he has not been funny since the naked gun movies. well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a naked gun movie! the movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. nothing in the entire movie was funny. the first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old magoo cartoons. i wish the movie would have stayed that way.

i know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but i am going to anyway! i waited for a laugh, i tried to give it time. i think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. my laugh never came, so i gave up.it's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. it isn't anywhere near that high grade. let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. they may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't. i suppose, if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experience.a very pathetic effort.

i enjoyed the mr. magoo cartoons i saw while growing up. and i enjoy leslie nielson's comic skills. so, i thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.i couldn't have been more wrong.this movie was just awful. i don't recall a single funny moment. this is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) i've wanted my money back. you will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. in a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags. this plot does neither. it just kinda lies there, gasping like a beached fish.

horrible horrible movie, i still can't believe my friend talked me into seeing this! no plot, bad acting, unfunny scenes, and very very stupid dialogue. all i have to say is that this movie is the worst movie i have seen and it's worse than halloween iii which i gave 0 stars too. so i give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well on here a 1, but you get the point.

this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in. this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny. he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. the movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated. if the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it, and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on. on a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a score of -100.

after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. a sick film that was not funny and was not worth the money, any money at all. if anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. so if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. i beg of you, don't!

it'll be a blue christmas indeed if you subject you're family to this. i loved the original movie, and this one was not worthy of being its sequel. actually, for all intents and purposes, it is not its sequel. only one character from the original cast returns. granted, that character happened to be the hilarious cousin eddie, but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie. his niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany antics--alongside chevy chase. chevy chase was needed in this film for it to be a success, and he definitely was not there. as far as i am concerned, a movie is not a "vacation" movie unless good ole' clark griswold is at the helm.

only one word can describe mr magoo - slapstick. unfortunately this isn't no airplane. looks can decieve, and that's exactly what mr magoo does. based on the old cartoon, leslie nielson plays magoo, a bumbling near blind man whop stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. now he must hunt them down using...blindness basically. and that's all this film plays off. the blindness of mr magoo. now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this, but pretty much it's just one of those " droopy dumb grin on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you payed to see this" films. but mr magoo isn't as bad as it's hacked up to be. it's at least got some funny jokes, and it's good wholesome fun for the whole family (nielson tried to make a "naked gun" for families in magoo, but it's no where near as good as that). so see it once, you might hate it, you might love it, whatever. i personally didn't hate it, but i sure didn't like it, or even rate it "okay." 2/5 stars for mr magoo-john ulmer

i left the theater, and i was only 10 years old. that's how bad it sucked. the plot was horrid and the acting was worse. leslie nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. i was only 10 years old when i went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age i did not laugh once at the movie. we (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. we ended up going into the 'r' movie my parents were in. bottom line -- this flick was fricking bad. mr. magoo -- more like mr. ma-who? this movie could have scarred me for life had i watched the popular cartoon on television as a child but luckily i had never seen it, so i was spared the agony but i will never get back those precious minutes of my life that i wasted.

this movie had terrible acting, terrible plot, and terrible choice of actors. (leslie nielsen...come on!!!) the one part i considered slightly funny was the battling fbi/cia agents, but because the audience was mainly kids they didn't understand that theme.

this morning, i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. i found myself thinking, "oh yeah, there was a mr. magoo movie, wasn't there?" this is more surprising because i remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). i even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because i am a fan of both mr. magoo, and mr. nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play mr. magoo. i even remember the opening animated credits, because i thought that they were pretty amusing.after that, though, its all a complete blank. i think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember anything from it. i understand that leslie nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but i saw him in "spy hard," in "scary movie 4," and "police squad 3" and none of these were great movies, but i came away at least remembering *something*. mr. magoo, though, is a complete blank.i find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.

leslie nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen. there is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn't all that funny. how many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? that's not funny, that's just pitiful. nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and stanley tong needs to stick to making jackie chan films, because it doesn't get much worse than this.

give director stanley tong of jackie chan's super cop and rumble in the bronx, and what do you get? you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo-like madness.the limited plot has magoo (leslie nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. of course he has no idea what he is doing. in fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken. you will wish that you were as nearsighted as magoo. its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster! you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies. this isn't his best, but he does a good job playing magoo. i thought it was a funny film, and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny.

leslie nielsen is usually someone whose movies i really like (even critically panned flicks like "dracula: dead and loving it" and "wrongfully accused"). so the fact that i'm slamming "mr. magoo" should show that it's a piece of junk. it casts nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. it seems like the combo of nielsen and director stanley tong (behind two of jackie chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor here.so, the original cartoon with jim backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. leslie nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. also starring kelly lynch, stephen tobolowsky, ernie hudson, malcolm mcdowell and miguel ferrer; they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.

i saw this with my with my kids they love it but i don't she did not get run overfed by a reindeer in the song, but what the heck in this crappy movie she got hit by the sleigh, it's like what the heck why why, when my kids heard the sinked they thought it was good but we they watched this they were like this "daddy why did granny" thats how my kids say grandma, any way my kids said this "daddy why did grandma get hit by a sleigh" i told them that the movie was crappy they agreed, it's sad why would any one name there dog "doofas" that's just dumb & when every one dressed in black that looked so so i mean daphne looked like a dang emo goth girl every one looked like goths & in the song they found grandma on the ground i think she died in the song, but in this weird crappy movie she was gone i think they should take this show off ok every one would love this i give this a 1 out of 10

lame, ridiculous and absurd. my 6 year old son talked us into watching this rubbish. tripe stereotypes and themes not appropriate for children. the antithesis of the commercialism of christmas is not socialism it's jesus.

this is supposedly a story in which a grown man tells a story about his youth. yet, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc, which are items used in the late 20th century and early 21st. so when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020. gee, i wonder how advanced we are then. how about telling us that.also, there are several legal issues which also make no sense. in the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country. also, grandma would have to be missing at least seven years in most states before to be declared officially dead.congratulations elmo shropshire. you are now officially a sellout.

who gave these people money to make a movie? there was nothing funny about it. the fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this piece of sickness says it all. first of all, it has nothing to do with christmas, it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the chevy chase original. they took randy 'i have no talent, i m just a fat and sweaty pig' quaid (the only wrong thing about part 1) and made a 'movie' about him...there are only morons in his family, but not the 'aren't they cute' kinda moronic, but the 'don t touch me' kinda moronic. watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone who takes part in it dies! they didn't even bother to get the effects in order...when they re on the boat, the only thing that moves is the fake background...when pigface quaid is in the water you can tell by the lighting that it's in a studio. this movie was sexist (uncle nick), racist (uncle nick) and should never have been made..never...throwing the money into a volcano would have had so much more use.well i hope i reached some of you...nobody warned me and now i m scarred for life merry f*cking christmas

i was out-of-town, visiting an old friend. after dinner, talking, he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boy friend. she's 15, beautiful, smart, athletic, and the young man is also from an excellent family, nice, also athletic (if not as smart). i told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns; however, a few minutes later the young man arrived, with his dvd of this flick, which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others. these folks have a bona fide home theater set-up, with a screen something in excess of 4 feet, and the two young folks preceded to view it, while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame-by-frame.i saw enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in its awfulness) to endorse all of the most critical comments i've seen in scanning some here.i told my friend i wouldn't go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus -- but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch.some flicks are so-bad-they're-good: the classic "plan 9 from outer space;" and, in my opinion, the wonderfully awful bruce jenner/village people work, "can't stop the music."however, this one remains firmly simply in the awful category.second/third/fourth "bananas" -- even the best of these (e.g. tim conway, don knotts, everybody with seinfeld) have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series (or, as here, film). and these were great supporting characters in their original situations.the "eddie" character, really at about the 5th- or 6th-banana level in the prior griswald movies, and never added a whole lot to these, in my opinion. randy quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances. his contribution to the prior "vacation" pic's was average, at best. both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done some good work in the past, accomplished nothing for their efforts here, except to derive a few years' house payments or some ira contributions.this whole presentation --- story, performances (from lead to support) couldn't be worse.

note, i only saw approximately the last half of this movie, so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate, that being said, seeing what i saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one-star rating for this is enough.in short, it's a dismal-plot slaughter of the wonderful precursor (nl christmas vacation) with chevy chase, only it doesn't have chevy chase in it, and it takes place in a generic tropical island, essentially with no connection to christmas at all.ol' chevy probably didn't want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun, instead they got the screwy cousin eddie, who, again, was great in the original, but in this he is just over the top, and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting. the attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it, and considering that this is supposed to be comedy, i doubt i need to say more.this is not to be seen for its qualities, for it has none, but for it's failings and again, how hollywood is spilling it's life's blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck.i think i'll watch the original before the upcoming christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence, from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just high-budget, but mindless, garbage.

this movie was awful. it centered too much around eddie, clark griswald's brother-in-law. eddie works much better when changing good quips such as in "christmas vacation" and "vacation".i really don't understand how a movie like this would be given the thumbs up. now, don't get me wrong, i like randy quaid, but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. this movie leaves much to be desired and really needed some bigger name actors.

god bless randy quaid...his leachorous cousin eddie in vacation and christmas vacation hilariously stole the show. he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a look.i will say that he tries hard in this made for tv sequel, but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really gets anywhere. quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets (including the orginal audrey, dana barron) are wasted here. even european vacation's eric idle cannot save the show in a brief cameo....pathetic and sad...actually painful to watch....christmas vacation 2 is the worst of the vacation franchise.

i was shocked at how bad it was and unable to turn away from the disaster. this made 'major league ii' and 'blues brothers 2000' oscar-worthy in comparison.i have tried to remember watching anything as bad as this in my life and was unable to come up with anything even close.

i can't believe i bought this movie on dvd. i don't even remember it being shown on tv last year. why in the world couldn't they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made? damn and randy quaid looks like he's been on the same drugs as jerry lewis. i didn't know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated. boy did i make a mistake. if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation. well at least i didn't pay more then 10 bucks for it. maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records. then again maybe not. ps i still haven't watched it yet, my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie, the chronicles of riddick (unrated director's cut) woo freaking hoo.

first of all, i personally adore demons and demons 2, i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in russia when i was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. then i heard nothing about mr bava. then i saw his ghost son. well, it is certainly not a good coming back! why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul? why is the plot so primitive? haven't we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of movie production? it is clear that lamberto bava has nothing to show us so far. it is a shame.

"ghost son" is lamberto bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst. i suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. it's his best because it's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it's a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of bava's past efforts. let's face it: many fans, myself certainly included, wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title. the only motivation here was lamberto bava, who brought us large amounts of convoluted gialli and fun splatter films in the past. "ghost son" is a bit of his comeback film, alongside "the torturer", and although the latter definitely isn't a good film, it at least lives up to his fans' lines of expectations, with excessive amounts of sleaze, blood and sadism. "ghost son" is a weak and intolerably soft horror film, even talking in terms of mainstream ghost stories. the emphasis lies too much on sentimentality, and this badly affects the already limited number of horrific & creepily atmospheric moments. the basic premise might feature one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is overall dull and far too clichéd. john hannah and laura harring star as a happy couple, living on a remote ranch in south africa and breeding horses for a living. the joy and happiness couldn't possibly improve, so naturally something tragic is bound to happen, and it does. mark dies in a car accident, but the inconsolable stacey remains at the ranch where she's in constant contact with mark's spirit. she even gets pregnant with his child, but shortly after baby martin's birth mysterious events begin to occur. it seems as if mark's restless and selfish ghost 'possessed' the baby and uses him to encourage stacy into committing suicide. with all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and sub plots are underdeveloped and/or remains unexplained, like the whole background of the youthful maid thandi. there's too little action and the only real fright-moments are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as "the exorcist" and "rosemary's baby" (vomiting green goo, self moving furniture). purely talking in terms of horrific entertainment "ghost son" is a painful misfire, but it has to be said, it's a beautiful and enchanting looking failure. the cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive. the moody score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though there's nothing of any significance happening on screen. there are several beautiful images of the south african wildlife to admire but, if that interests you, i suppose you're better off watching national geographic instead. not much to recommend here. fans of atmosphere-driven ghost stories have much better options to choose from and die-hard bava fanatics are advised to (re-)watch "demons", "macabre" or "blade in the dark".

alas, it seems that the golden times of stylish italian cinema have sunk into oblivion. and the recent brainchild of celebrated filmmaker lamberto bava is yet another obvious proof to that assumption.i felt lucky to watch many films from this prolific director (like body puzzle, delerium, macabre and both demons). albeit not entirely satisfying they have never been that dull.a suspicion that this new entry to my dvd collection was money thrown to the winds arose shortly in the aftermath of the car crash scene exhibiting an awkward and unlikely position of the body under the flip-over car.and the sense of shallowness grew up in the course of the ponderously narrated chain of events that followed.dumb dialogs, suspenseless script and a total waste of talents from the international cast. the only character that provided more or less passable performance was the mischievous mark's son juicing up the entire boredom.unfortunately, mario's son job on all accounts could hardly be hailed.i look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully expected to be an improvement.

i started off being interested somewhat in the movie. it appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. alas, it didn't hold up.i need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. look, i know this was not supposed to be shakespeare, but come on, i need some quality in script and characterization.the acting was alright, the writing not so much. at one point, james brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed. he states that ordering him around will not work. his new wife says that if he goes home and changes she will rip his clothes off later. that is a howler. this movie had a few unintentionally funny lines.it was hard to care about jame's brolin's character. when he so readily gave his first wife's things to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be snubbed, i lost most of my sympathy. who really cares what happens to him. i must confess that i did not finish the movie. if it did a 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. it was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable i felt there was no need to finish it.

to start this movie was sick. here your wife is dying and you go strutting around town with this blond chic by your side. then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. hank (james brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout this movie. i called him fast hank. fast hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends. the part that gets me is when she is "doing it" in the barn with kevin and gets caught by another one of hanks friends. kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her robe and bam!! right into the arms of this other guy and they start "doing it" right then and there. i guess he is finishing up what kevin started. how gross!!!! i am like this is lifetime movie??? its a typical old man young woman movie that says you can have my body if i get your money...

stunning blonde natasha henstridge is the young, not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a tv reporter in monroeville, virginia. and among the community's well-heeled horsey-set, she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband. that's james brolin, trusting as a babe-in-arms. flashback teledrama made in canada, based on an article that appeared in vanity fair magazine. it must be true! whatever, it's far more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. leggy species star henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse? it could happen, i guess. and it's good to see brolin in a sizeable role after his titchy turn in antwone fisher, even if he doesn't make it to the end of the picture. the end of the picture? he doesn't even make it to the beginning of the picture. which is why flashbacks were invented, of course.

somehow, this documentary about miles manages to include very little music and no complete tunes. though miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other folks, not miles. there are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood prodigy, his drug addiction) are skipped or glossed over, and you'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. skip it.

first the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. it reminded me of norman bates in psycho or ed wood in ed wood. the jokes are lame and old, you've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. the whole cast is wasted. i bet people signed on just to be in a shirley maclaine vehicle. please, would somebody tell shirley she did her best comedy in two mules for sister sara. see it...if there's no reruns of andy griffith on.

this movie was terrible. the plot was terrible and unbelievable. i cannot recommend this movie. where did this movie come from? this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including: gary sinise, kathy bates, joey lauren adams, and jennifer tilly.

*****spoiler or two, not that is matters******two things stand out about this movie. first is it's been titled both "bruno" and "the dress code," and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. the adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in. shirley maclaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion, which probably opens up an even thornier can of worms--what was she thinking? yes, there's some humor and it's not directly offensive, but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing. it doesn't do much except repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or maybe excepted?) no matter what. which is fine----but in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along. bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress, he wants to show up looking like a miniature gladys knight on awards night, and his final costume makes him resemble a cabbage patch cowgirl doll. yet all the other kids dress and behave, well, like regular kids. so what gives? if it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like, and the result would be total chaos. this accepting of people who are "different" is also pretty narrowly defined, i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls, hunt geese, and go to tractor pulls, and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is. "bruno" is one stupid movie, and a complete waste of time.

absolutely the worst experience i have ever been through. i think my eyes started bleeding. i actually got sick the night after watching this. i don't even consider this a movie. movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining. this fails horribly. i could not make it through the entire film, so because the ending could be greatest phenomenon in motion picture history, this gets a 1 for that small chance. otherwise it would be a flat 0.i can't see how national lampoon, or let alone any organization, would sponsor this atrocity. renting this dvd is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. only watch this if you want to make ever other movie you will ever watch seem great. without question this is the worst movie i have ever seen.

brainy, cross-dressing little boy finds success on the spelling bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. shirley maclaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother, and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors getting their chance at directing a film, the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with. here, the only person well-cast in "bruno" is maclaine. the child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness, and squishy-hearted maclaine holds their close-ups for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubs seems natural, not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. as the boy's disgruntled father, poor gary sinise hovers around the edges, in mock shame, always with a pained look on his face. towards the end of the film, maclaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes, and even concludes with the kid hugging the pope in rome! another ungodly treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who, much like sally field and her film "beautiful", cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience. shirley uses ethnicity for shtick, and childhood innocence as a punchline. the children in this cast roll their eyes, crack wise with mature comments, use big words--but when one mealy-mouthed boy calls our pint-sized hero "gay", maclaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out (in front the media!). how's that for progression? * from ****

this is a horrific re-make of the french movie ma vie en rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). the only scenario that i can imagine in which anyone (sinise?! bates?! butler?! what were they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is maclaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for american audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid. then she enlisted other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends -- certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink script.i'm not a knee-jerk fan of french film, but ma vie en rose is a subtle, thoughtful, and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. i would love to see it get wider exposure among english-speaking audiences -- and if that means an american re-make, so be it. but puh-leeze! a little respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience -- and better direction for the actors, who couldn't seem to decide if they were working for tennessee williams or jerry lewis!

this odd little film starts out with the story of bruno (alex linz) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday. he likes to wear dresses and his obese mother angela who is a dressmaker doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes. angela complains to mother superior (kathy bates) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs. bruno's father dino (gary sinise) is divorced from angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him. bruno meets a new student at school named shawniqua (kiami davael) who is a free spirit and dresses like annie oakley with cap pistols. angela has a heart attack and bruno's grandmother steps in to take care of him when dino refuses.the film starts out with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved. angela has a great deal to do with bruno wearing dresses as she practically encourages him. dino was told when he was a young boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help bruno when he needs it. the catholic school that bruno attends is very unruly and all the kids run rampant and even call shawniqua the "n" word. once shirley maclaine steps in the film shifts and becomes more family oriented (so to speak). ****spoiler alert**** the ending after the spelling bee is incredibly contrived and "feel good". hugs and cheers for bruno as reporters follow him and take his picture for their papers. all the while shirley maclaine is acting like the "tough old broad" who snaps at everyone. there is one thing about maclaine's character in the film that no one has mention in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of her. i think the character of helen might be a lesbian! she's very tough and strong and at one point in the film she shares a shot of whiskey with bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. i don't remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married at all! this is why i think her character might be gay. lots of other good actors appear in the film as well. joey lauren adams, jennifer tilly, brett butler, gwen verdon and lainie kazan all should have taken a better look at the script before they signed on. i guess when they heard that maclaine was directing that it would be an honor to be part of it. very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject matter is probably impossible for most to relate to. the actors are not bad but what exactly was maclaine aiming for? tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? we get that in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time i was trying not to cringe.

this movie was disturbing, not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled. the extremely overweight mother (angela) did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did. this is not fair but is a statement in itself. i also notice her picture is missing from imdb (maybe her own choice) and it looks like this is her only film ever? the language in this movie was crude beyond necessity. watched with my 10yr old son because it was rated pg in canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful & disgusting. never did appreciate shirley maclain like so many others seem to.love kathy bates and always will. sinese's part was annoying.the little boy alex is a great little actor. i'll have to see what else he's been up to lately..

the recent documentary "the adventures of errol flynn" is an in-depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero. bogart,cagney, wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. if he hadn't been under contract to warner bros. he would've of been perfect in the cary grant role in suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator. and he could've starred with his best leading ladies sister joan fontaine. that was flynn's trouble he was the ultimate screen hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him. grant and flynn in a way are similar but flynn was the more macho of the two;it is possible to see grant as captain blood but flynn in the philadelphia story mr. blanding builds his dream house,or monkey business,or operation petticoat would've turned those roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would've brought naturally would've made the story lines wobbly. but this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of flynn and his era. there are times when i half expected a laugh track or an audience to go "ahhh" at some point. it doesn't go deeply into flynn's life just the screen magazine view. it also doesn't delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring-doer. like the cleaned up biographies of lon chaney( the father,not the wolfman,or lenny"of mice and men) and buster keaton done in the '50's this is just a time killing piece of fluff

after watching this film, i thought to myself, they really glossed up errol flynn's life! the movie is really nice eye candy. they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right. the costumes were great. all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair.is this a serious film about errol flynn's life? nah! it's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life.why am i critiquing this film? this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver. duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn. he was not as good looking as the original, but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously, but as a man who, although gifted with great talent, was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside. flynn's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages. he also lost a lot of good friends during his life. he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland. the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away. he is shown in his tux, looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool. it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle.this film could've had much more depth, could've been better well-written. sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynn's human center. surprisingly, duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didn't put any depth there.i'll probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film, "gosh, this could've been so much more.....!" i give this film a d+.

if you read errol flynn's autobiography, my wicked, wicked ways, you will see that this film is full of poetic licence. not that that makes much of a difference, because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic licence in the autobiography anyway. no need to worry about spoilers, since there is nothing there to spoil.to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a fictitious hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than duncan regehr to play him, and you wouldn't have to worry about the audience saying things like: "but he didn't have a moustaches in captain blood." another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a two-dimensional character. flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. this film only concentrates on his funster image.regehr is a disaster. the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts. hal linden is ok as warner, and barbara hershey makes a believable damita, although lili damita herself did not think so.the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion. so what i am writing this for, i can't imagine.

they said it would be a film greater than turks fruit. how darethey? it's not even 10% of this classic. bad acting. the only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by angela schijf. her acting was the best in the whole film. the story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.i really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.

actually i'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie i like. as for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. the acting was too bad in my opinion. not very likely that antonie kamerling will get a rutger hauer status. some folks will expect it anyway. first let him work on his english pronunciation. if you watch the 'trip' to paris of these actors (dvd-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. advice to beau dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... to the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please. being generous, i'd give it 4 out of 10.

if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years, my worst fears have come true. i have never, even in dutch movies, seen worse acting. i couldn't get myself to watch it for more than 40 minutes, so if that's the cause of me missing the genius, so be it.

i watched about the first 30 - 40 minutes of this movie on television the other night and can agree that this is by far the worst of the series. not any of it is funny, even randy quaid can't save this mess. eric idle wasn't funny in n.l. euro. vacation, and he's even worse here. the only funny scene is where they're at the airport and some guy dressed as santa walks by the camera yelling "did anybody lose this?" as he holds up a prosthetic leg...1/2 a star out of ****

as a fan of author gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which ik ook van jou is not the best one), i was looking forward to see this film. i didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv i'm terribly happy i resisted buying it on video. out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in dutch film history. all the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. all humour has been cut out. what's left is a bad-acted, over dramatic, non-consistent film that i do not want to watch again ever.i condolate giphart with this result, and am happy that robbert jan westdijk did a hell of a better job on giphart's topper phileine zegt sorry. go see that one!

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a while. the acting was just soooo bad. anthonie kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. especially his voice over was extremely wooden. beau van erven dorens was completely over the top as frat boy fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. it all sounded way to bookish.some of the situations were very badly visualized. example: somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid. this bit is just too incredible to be true. you see an obviously rather shallow bit of river, with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface (hence the rapid). we hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there's danger ahead. a canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid. our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl. girl swoons in his arms and utters the words 'you saved me...' vomit!it actually was so bad, that it became funny. this is sad, because it really wasn't intended. at the intermission i overheard some guy behind me say 'o god, there's another part!' my feelings exactly. what scares me is that the end credits of 'ik ook van jou' were in english. does this mean that it will be released abroad? just when the netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like 'antonia' (antonia's line) and 'karakter' (character)...

one of the movies i just didn't want to see. i got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! at the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.

yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. we picked "ik ook van jou" more or less at random, but we were interested to see the state of current dutch filmmaking.the film is based on a book by ronald giphart, and i must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. the film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap-operas and/or afternoon talk shows. at least one of them (kamerling) has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world. so we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.and what a mistake that was. this movie fails on all fronts. bad acting (the best performance is actually by a guinea pig, which very convincingly pretends to be dead). flat, uninteresting story with unexplained and uninteresting sidelines (why france? why tell the story to a girl from uganda?) mistakes (black people dont have to use sunscreen, as far as i know, and heating systems in the netherlands do not produce clouds of steam like in new york, even if this looks great on film, people do not wear t-shirts outside on new years eve in northern europe). there's one funny moment which involves two little dogs, and that's it.so that's what i think, but more importantly, it seemed that none of the people leaving the movie theater afterwards had enjoyed it. i overheard one of them saying that he was extremely disappointed, because he liked the book so much. i did not read the book, but my advice would have to be: read the book, don't see the film.

from 2002 on dutch cinema finally got better again. this movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of dutch cinema.the story is needlessly told in flashback style. all of the 'present' sequences set in france are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. for some reason european filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. i never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.the story self also isn't exactly the greatest. it isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell. the story of a young unexperienced boy falling in love with a wild young girl, who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to paul verhoeven's "turks fruit", to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release. however the end result is far from comparable. the story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors. the way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling. i lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie.at the time this movie was made, both antonie kamerling and angela schijf were promising rising stars, with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much dried up by now. angela schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (that is not a bad thing of course), while antonie kamerling tried to start a career in hollywood. he never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 renny harlin flops. to be honest i'm not surprised. it's not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his english just isn't good enough, to put it mildly. just listen to him speaking english in the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what i mean. they are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie. it's probably also due to the poor dialog. i still kind of liked beau van erven dorens. he's been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural. he always keeps the characters close to who he self is.it by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it's not exactly one i would recommend either. bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie.4/10

i'm a big fan of the "vacation" franchise, and i love randy quaid as cousin eddie, and at least a couple of the behind-the-scenes names were involved in this project (most notably matty simmons, who produced or executive-produced all 4 of the theatrical releases, as well as "animal house"). for those reasons i figured this made-for-tv spin off might be worth checking out, even without chevy chase.for the record, i did not expect it to be very good; i just thought it might be a slightly amusing diversion. therefore, my high level of disappointment goes to prove just how bad this utter turd of a movie really was. it was mind-numbingly, jaw-droppingly, heart-stoppingly, head-explodingly terrible. yet, somehow, i could not stop watching it. it's a sickness i have; i can't seem to walk out on a film or give up on a tv show before it ends. nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie.

i knew this would be one of the worst movies i could have imagined...but in just 20 short minutes it actually exceeded my low expections by being possibly the worst movie i have ever seen.i have already wasted too much time typing about it...trust me, it sucks.

i loved the original, i watch it every year. but the second is a piece of garbage and it never should have been made. the second could have worked if there was a different location. the son was not an original or didn't even act like one of eddie's kids. third was too smart for eddie which downplayed his father role. none of the other kids where in it. it just could of been a lot better. i don't know why they even tried to make this movie. there was no continuncy from the first movie. i will pretend that this one doesn't even exist. it is sad that the actors didn't even see that they where made fools of. a really bad movie. i just think that i wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and i really love all of the national lampoon films.

i sat through all 2 hours. i do not know what was worse, the awful plot, the lame characters or the hawaiian hottie that eddie's 11 yearold kid and 80 year old grandpa made sexual advances toward. the money spent on this was just flushed down the throne. matty simmons should be ashamed. the original idea for this movie was "a swiss family griswold" and it somehow turned into this mess. the only bright spot is that it's ratings were so bad we will never see this on tv again. avoid at all costs...rent ernest saves xmas or something else.

i am a fan of a few of the vacation films, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the tv screen, you know it's out of steam. made for tv national lampoon films do not do well on tv. this movie is another reason.i think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out, but we also had to face the reality...it's a tv movie. randy quaid is fine as cousin eddie, but is better in a supporting role than the lead. dana barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the griswold kids. she is just as pretty, but it doesn't help a thin script. why was this movie even made? it was probably because nbc recently picked up another few years of presenting x-mas vacation. there is nothing wrong with the acting. it's all in the script. it's just not that funny. people need to think before they write stuff like this. it is one christmas movie i do not recommend.

i just watched national lampoon's christmas vacation 2 on dvd, hoping to see something at least close to the original, great holiday comedy, 'christmas vacation'. i saw nothing of the kind. you can tell right from the start that this movie just wasn't going to measure up. it's too bad it has a title that links it to the original christmas vacation. it's really kind of sad. the film can't stand on it's own merits. i think too many people will view this film on the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy. other than the title, there is very little connecting the movie to the original 'christmas vacation' and even less of a connection to christmas at all. the comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor. children might find some humor here but most adults would only get a chuckle here and there. this movie is a flop. don't waste your time with it.

why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest christmas movies of all time. the movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made. randy quaid's portrayal of cousin eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous outings as cousin eddie. also, the eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie. even "eye candy" sung hi lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap. please do not waste your time on this move, just watch the original again.

arthur miller has always been known as one of america's great playwrights for works such as "death of a salesman" and "the crucible". "focus" is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen. however, knowing what a great playwright arthur miller is, i doubt that his original play was very much like the movie. the movie comes across as empty and formulaic, with william h. macy as a non-jew mistaken for a jew by anti-semitic neighbors in wwii brooklyn. don't get me wrong: the acting is ok, and i presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism, but the movie just doesn't work. macy, laura dern and david paymer just can't create an effective story with the material here.

did the other reviewers watch the same movie i did? this was poorly written, poorly acted, and just overall boring. i made it well past the halfway point in the movie and then just gave up. i can't possibly imagine an ending that would have made the rest of the movie worthwhile. don't waste your time with this dog. seriously.

i had the unlucky experience of stumbling upon a preview for this movie and thought it might be interesting. i am a fan of the two main actors, and i even find meatloaf to be oddly appealing, but that couldn't compensate for the droning plot of this movie. this movie attempts to make social comments and be artfully intelligent. i am sure the audience gets the sociological message clearly, but has to suffer in the process. personally, no matter how bad the movie is, i can't stop it in the middle. something drives me to finish the worst of movies, but i often regret it. this is one of those...

let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of jews. that said, the problem with this movie is that it views the united states - probably the most welcoming society ever to jews outside of israel - as a not very different place from nazi germany. set in 1943, the movie is about a man (william h. macy) who gets confused with a jew after he starts wearing glasses!. a number of very nasty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, his neighbors shunned him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). from one of arthur miller's self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name.

i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd. i was immediately intrigued by everything about it: the actors, the title, the cover, and especially the author. arthur miller, you can't go wrong with him, can you? yep. i haven't read the novel, but i'm going to guess it was a lot better than the film. i had high hopes for this movie. i love macy and dern, and it looked interesting. unfortunately, this film never really rises above cookie-cutter messages about racism and bigotry. if you've never seen any other films that deal with this subject, or if you never knew that america was founded on bigotry, then maybe this film will wow you. others will probably find it predictable, stale, and overall bland.

if good intentions were enough to produce a good film, i would have rated the turgid, ponderous, obvious "focus" a bit higher than 4. macy does his best, but as an earlier poster commented, miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often. perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on newman, so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him. i agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in america during this time period, then this movie might be an eye-opener. i grew up in the fifties, and the "good" pastors of my lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach, whose sign prominently indicated that no jews or blacks would be admitted. it is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm, and not just in the south. as late as 1964, when i graduated from a somewhat racially integrated (but sexually segregated) public high school in baltimore, my black classmates could not attend the traditional "father and son banquet," as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks. sadly, it was an establishment owned by a jewish family. the subject matter of "focus" is important, and we should never forget, despite the lingering signs of racism in modern america, how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were.(the "greatest generation," indeed). so, perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of steven spielberg and tom brokow. but in the end, as in "far from heaven," the filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time.

most likely "cleopatra 2525" will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it was broadcast; and i don't think that many people did. but if you are still somewhat intrigued it is a "buck rogers in the 25th century" premise without space ships and with no budget for wardrobe or production design. in this case the buck rogers part (cleopatra) is played by jennifer sky. which one might expect to be a good thing as jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented; and has a nice comedic touch. but a quick glance at the promotional material will show that she is somewhat the worse for having a bad haircut and a salvation army thrift store wardrobe. if you remember how fetching jennifer was during her time on "xena" her dowdy cleopatra look will be a huge disappointment. with a target audience of "teenage boys looking to burn their eyeballs looking at "hot fetish-attired girls" it is not a good idea to skimp on the exploitation value of your heroine or her costume. and they wonder why some series don't attract much of an audience. love it or hate it, "buck rogers" had hotter costumes and much better looking guest stars. the other two exploitation elements are cleopatra's two female associates; hel (gina torres basically playing her stock "firefly" character) and sarge (victoria pratt-another "xena" connection-an extremely wooden version of natasha henstridge). torres does a good job playing off the cleopatra character, providing most of the show's comic relief. torres sings the theme song, a somewhat lame parody of rick evans' "in the year 2525 (exordium and terminus)" (1969). you remember the one that opens with the words "in the year 2525, if man is still alive, if woman can survive, they may find..."i suspect that they gave the series its title so that they could butcher this catchy little song although who knows, perhaps the title is a homage to "buck rogers" and they thought of using the song later. so, the premise of the show is that the earth's surface has been taken over by aliens called bailies (not the wkrp one) and the humans have been driven underground. our three heroines fight against the bailies under the direction of a disembodied (presumably) female voice (appropriately referred to as "voice"). unlike buck rogers, cleopatra is kind of a wimpy third stooge, still dazed and confused from her cryogenic sleep or maybe just disoriented from the creepy haircut. there are a lot of nice close-ups of sky wide-eyed and bewildered. like "buck rogers" the running gag is cleopatra using a common 21st century expression and everyone finding it either totally profound or completely baffling. unlike "firefly" the action is more of that hyper edited "xena" garbage which is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining. one good gimmick is that the girls travel around "spiderman" fashion, a sort of web slinging through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. strangely (or maybe not considering the budget) these are only half hour episodes and except for one two-part show there is not enough time for any subtlety and nuance. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed. a few shocking, funny moments (fisting the hollow carla, a urinating harpy in the dreamland) and two competing interesting premises (similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head) but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development. just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state doesn't make it lynchian. you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances.positive things: dr. maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute. carla's father, chalmers, and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun. and tom savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we couldn't see if he was just reading cue cards.i get the hammer references, but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together. but they don't work because they're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone. condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short, but at feature length, skip it. it's not "so bad it's good" it's just "so bad it's boring".

i am a big fan of horror movies, and know a lot of info on serial killers. obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating, because half of the movie was fictional. more than that, the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light. i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica. i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story. this movie was awful, the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasn't too bad. acting= horrible actors= sub par movie= waste of time.a big upset all around, but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie.

the story of ed gein is interesting, very interesting. this movie, however, interesting only in the fact that it was actually made. kane hodder's portrayal of ed gein is so far off, it's not even the slightest bit funny. ed gein did not behave psychotic in public, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen, this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience. but the biggest mistake of this movie, side from even one frame ever being shot, was that ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother, whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave. he killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was god's will, and he was very remorseful about it, though that didn't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing people's flesh. i officially gave this movie a rating of "1" simply because "0" wasn't given to me as an option.i highly advise all to stay clear of this movie. if you want to see a movie that accurately depicts ed gein and doesn't try to put in a sub-plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed, i highly advise you see the original movie, which unfortunately seems to not be on imdb.com though i could be wrong, but i have yet to find it here. the original doesn't stray from the actual events and doesn't try to twist the story. i can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself, something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9/11, but gave it a twist that canada was behind it. or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the nazi's.

michael feifer writes and directs this fictitious story based on the arrest of edward gein in plainfield, wisconsin. gein was responsible for a rash of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950's. his evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous lutheran mother. ed was given the nickname "the butcher of plainfield". he would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before 'dressing them like a deer' in his garage. severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark. after his arrest there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home. in this movie, a young deputy bobby mason(shawn hoffman)makes the search for gein(kane hodder)a personal one, when his storekeeper mother(priscilla barnes)goes missing. the acting is a whole lot better than the ridiculously liberal telling of the documented events concerning gein. also in the cast: adrienne frantz, timothy oman, john burke, michael berryman and amy lyndon.

ed gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like norman bates, leatherface, and buffalo bill. he is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time, i watched a documentary on him, so i know his story pretty well. when i saw this, i was curious because i thought it was supposed to be like a documentary re-enactment, but i have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. first off, the facts are completely wrong, with a few minor exceptions, and secondly, this was just a stupid hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck. not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie, this was poorly acted! ed gein, he lives in a small town in wisconsin called plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by, he digs up dead bodies, as well as brutally murdering people. bobby, a deputy, is on the case to get ed gein, only, no one knows who the killer is at first, just finding crime scene after crime scene. but things get "personal" when ed starts messing with the policemen's family and friends.of course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story. i always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick, but for this story, it should have been a better acted film, not to mention, it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid cliché'd horror film. please, stay away from this film, it's completely pathetic and untrue to the story of ed gein.1/10

please people! do not bother with this poorly directed joke. the direction was totally wrong from the outset. where is the history of his mothers' emotional interference and the general madness in the original family? why is ed portrayed as this large, overbearing imposing figure full of anger and hate? what is this crap? the writer and director obviously did no research into the history and just wanted to cash in on the infamous gein name. the fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth, it's ridiculous. if you want t see a brilliant gein film. go back to the minor classic "deranged" to see how ed really was. there is humor in that film, and ed is portrayed as more of the sad, lonely slight man he was, according-to history. where is the background story here? there is just poorly set-up shocks (that are not shocking) that we've seen before, and more accomplished as well. take the worst texas chainsaw massacre ripoff, and add this one to that list. had to give it one out of ten because rating wouldn't accept zero. i want my money back. if anyone regards this film as 'stunning' is possibly getting a financial kickback to do so.

"mr. and mrs. smith" is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock's movie. but if "lifeboat" (wich unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time (the early 40's) are really worth seeing. and to tell the truth, not discovering this film isn't really a lost."mr. and mrs. smith" is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it's rather hard to find the hitchcock's touch. maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow (wich isn't much) in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of (but it's well hidden in an impersonal package), in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction, and maybe in the character of the mother. and that's about it ! even for the hitchcock fan, there is little to connect with.and for the screwball comedies amateur, there isn't very much more: none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny, and we're far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance. and if one or two scene are quite amusing, there're not even the funniest in hitchcock's filmography, who created comical situations in almost all his movies (even "psycho" could be considered full of very dark humor). so, there is really little to save in this movie, that can without annoying anyone (or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy, who are in love with carole lombard), stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcock's movie.

the big problem i had with this movie was that lombard's character is, as another user put it, "unnecessarily cruel". lombard plays the role of ann krausheimer smith, who believes she is married to david smith, played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling robert montgomery. the movie has some funny moments, especially when montgomery's character goes to great lengths to try to get his "wife" back. understandably, she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal, but she only finds out three years into it.lombard's character seems quite cold to her "husband's" sincere attempts to woo her back. while not being highly adept in that effort, montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving, and yet lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice. there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie, and it is hard to see any sort of comedy- even dark comedy- in that aspect. to some extent, the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone, with lombard's character getting a "kick" out of her husband's feeble efforts. while one might consider this another 'battle of the sexes' type of movie, the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle, if that: montgomery's character, while certainly flawed, is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinist/misogynist (an excellent example of that is michael douglas in 'war of the roses'). in fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed by not only the sharp dress of montgomery (which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort in attempting-but failing- to play the role of a womanizing bachelor. his only major flaw is his vanity, but that fault does not balance out with his partner's excessive cruelty. and there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love. this is what makes it so cruel, and sad. montgomery's character simply looks weak. in reality, no wife would want a man so weak unless she "wears the pants" in the marriage. but then again, a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on. hence, the whole theme seems weird. this movie is neither a champion of feminism (lombard's character does show some signs of the sort of independent-oriented woman of the 60s, but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s), nor an even-sided battle of the sexes (as montgomery's character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause).this movie is, on the surface, a slapstick, but beneath that veneer it is really much darker, with sadistic undertones. all of which makes its resolution appear, well, odd. (maybe that oddity was the whole point?). in any case, slapstick this movie is not.

this movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting. straight from the coke-filled gutters of new york's arty farty incestuous drama scene.how so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie?get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job. otherwise, kill your self with a real gun.

after sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film, and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another james toback-directed mess called "when will i be loved", i've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. how else can these horribly written, painfully-directed pieces of trash get made in the first place.i like robert downey jr., but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse.heather graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance. half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze.such a crappy script. prepare yourself for hollywood name-dropping galore (example: five minute meandering discussions on denzel washington's acting....etc.)there's a great character in joseph heller's novel catch-22 named dunbar. he spends most of the time in the novel shooting skeet, which he abhors. when asked why he shoots skeet all the time if he hates it so much, he replies that it makes time creep by, and he'll have a longer life. well....if you really want to feel time creep by, watch this film! i swear...the 82 minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour david lean epic. it goes on and on and on and on...i hope i never watch another james toback film again. if i could give this no stars, i would.

at my local video rental store, they have a special place for two girls and a guy. it's a long running joke really. the clerk lets people rent it for free. they value their customers too much to let them waste their hard earned money on it.i was extremely surprised to see that people gave this movie a good review. maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes? did people involved with the movie write them? perhaps the mother of the director/writer?)maybe i've just seen so many good movies that this one fails in comparison.

i am being in no way facetious when i say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made. worse than "batman & robin". worse than "manos, hands of fate". seriously, it's that bad. when people tell me that a movie is terrible i use the "two girls" scale to figure it out. if the movie is comparable to "two girls" then i won't watch it. if it's twice as good, maybe i'll watch it, but only to laugh at the retards who paid somebody to make it, because a movie twice as good as this one would still be a piece of garbage.

the storyline seemed fine, the actors seemed fine, the movie shouldhave been fine. but it sure wasn't - it didn't lead us anywhere, thescenes are weird. maybe it was meant to create something new, to makeus think. that atleast it did: where is the rest of this film? to me itwas waste of money, time, and talent. someone might want to see thisfor curiosity, to see if they can figure it out. other i personallywouldn't recommend this to anyone.

the movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. to what purpose, one may ask? the problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.it starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the naxalite movement. affair, rejection and separation follows. people go their own ways, seemingly. only till the heroine forces herself upon them. not once but twice. after a pause in the 'movement', the next hurdle for these 3 is the emergency imposed on the country by indira gandhi. lots of political figures roam around for no obvious reason. the sub-plots are too contrived and don't add up to make a logical whole.the movie tries to impose a false pace but never reaches a true rhythm. barely coherent at times, there is no maturation and growth whatsoever in the arcs of the 3 ex-college buddies. even after they are presumably married, engaged, settled or whatever, they are ever too eager to just ditch it all and head off to a village to have sex with the ex-lover or ex-flame. what fertile imagination the screen-writer possesses. so many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that its downright abusive!!chitrangda singh has a horrible american accent that she doesn't try to hide. its hideous hearing her mouth cliché-ridden dialog like 'whats up? i didn't think you'd come' (this, after the hellish nightmare she's just been thru) or, in the beginning, 'i appreciate your concern but i can take care of myself'. yikes. what kind of clown wrote the dialogs for this? she invites her friend in to have a cup of 'south indian' (no less) coffee, wishes someone good morning and then is wished good night by someone else in the family. now whats up with that?!?the countless uncredited villagers and tribals are the best actors. the editing is really erratic with too many cuts. obviously trying hard to make a bold statement, sudhir misra screwed up big-time on this one.

this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the naxalite movement and blah blah. it is really just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who they should bed next; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop. literally, as we don't hear the villagers say a word, never mind learn anyone's name, thus they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in old hollywood films. the movie is also dull, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms. we are apparently supposed to admire the artsiness of it all, which merely means no good song and dance routine, which would not have saved the film of course, but might have at least alleviated the boredom.my friend japna was annoyed at the immorality of the whole story, not the bedroom bit but the whole pointlessness of the story. the message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing.

this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some indians who speak in english and were looking at the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north indian plains. the message - the educated english-speaking indian tried to save the poor beggars of india in all earnestness. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.as a love story its okay. the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics.

i rented a copy of this one from netflix -- big mistake. the dvd version titled "the one-armed swordsmen" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the dvd is still a mess. don't rent or buy it. not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. much as i liked seeing wang yu in his prime again after all these years, this one is an utter waste of time. i've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. what the chopped-up dvd version shows us is that no matter how silly a chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out.but "the one-armed swordsmen" does offer you do the chance to see both wang and shaw brothers stalwart lo lieh beating up smirking pretty boy david chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. lo plays a sort of second-string villain here, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. he film is also graced by the participation of taiwanese actor chang yi as the magistrate. another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where wang and chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making bruce lee noises while they fight. none of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity or common sense. it was fun to watch anyway.another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. there are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action or the plot.if you can find a copy of the original shaw brothers one-armed swordsman movie, the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.

as far as asian horror goes, i have seen my share of disappointments along with some of the creepiest sh*t imaginable... "acacia" doesn't really qualify for either of those categories. it had a few moments of tension and was interesting to watch, yet i couldn't help think that there should have been a tad more to this story. the film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a kid who appears to have a fascination with trees. he develops a bond with the acacia tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it. then, during a fight with his mother involving their new birth child, he storms off after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree. when he doesn't come back, the parents send file a report and wait, while the neighbor girl believes he somehow inhabits the acacia tree. the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird, but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort, though the story feels a little flat. hell, i can't really make up my mind on this...

in terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen. the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea...julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats, taking the side of "the people" against "the nobles." this is patently absurd. the caesars were as noble as you could get. their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war. there had been reformers, notably the gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens.there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous, if you know anything about the period. "cleopatra", with richard burton, will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded, fanciful though it is.historical accuracy is one thing. acting and dialogue are something else, and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production. i burst out laughing several times, especially when julia, the daughter of augustus, meets a lover. they clutch passionately, as she breathes: "my father..." "ah, your father, your father.... your father would disapprove." peter o'toole is at his worst, forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines. the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it's impossible to envision him as the cunning, crafty, machiavellian politician who created the roman empire. here, he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time.charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia, augustus's wife, with dignity. had she been given a fuller role to play, she might have rescued this production from absurdity.there is some nice photography and battle footage, helped by plenty of standard issue cgi. oddly, this was made for british tv (and appears to be a british-italian co-production) but is labeled with an "r" rating.the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice, although you only notice it during the few action sequences, as the movie is mostly talk.almost any roman movie, even "cleopatra" or "the fall of the roman empire", has more historicity --- to say nothing of compelling drama --- than this bizarre classics illustrated, jr. adaptation. this one gives new meaning to the much-abused phrase, "based on a true story." in this case they could have said, "suggested by real events."

this is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film conveniently takes off where rome ends. if you find rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy imperium: augustus. but, if you feel rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome. i especially disliked rome's image of cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict. there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress in imperium suits the part much better. o'toole and rampling are good, and so are some others. but then... if you have come to know - and love - atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find the depiction of her in imperium - as a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in imperium, but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more. you'll find no interesting female characters in this epic. there's also the painfully comic maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals).the interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés upon clichés. cleopatra's big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an egyptian theme park. there's a looooooooot of really poor 3d graphics, not up to 2003 standards.the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving. so we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, whereas some are not. an disproportional amount of time is wasted to show livia as the "eternal flame" of augustus. this affair doesn't sizzle for even a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score. whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture, every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most of the actors are non english speakers).everything is lukewarm in this epic. true, there are more historical accuracies than in rome, but dramatically speaking, it's plain boring. the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness. camera-work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye.there's really no-one to love and no-one to hate in imperium. regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome, there are much better films and miniseries around. ancient rome: the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend.

my wife and i couldn't even finish the film. truly, it was rather painful.first, the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. for instance, augustus takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. indeed, he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy.second, the camp! my lord, the dialog is horrifically bad. i recall the soap opera my mother watched when i was a child having better dialog than this. the constant exposition and pontificating grates upon the ears like fingernails on chalkboard. ugh. (okay, i exaggerate a bit, but the dialog truly is bad.) the hbo series rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least believable, regardless of their historicity.rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't stage epic battle scenes. the creators of this film did not. when caesar attacks munda, the battle scene is practically farcical.i will grant that the costumes are perfectly good. the sets are fine, though their cgi backdrops can be a bit jarring at times. the sound is bad, thoughboth in terms of the music, the foley work, and the dubbing of so many of the side characters.anyway, it's completely not worth renting. as a history major, i was hoping for an alternative approach to augustus than hbo's rome, which, i feel, failed to capture his overall "feel" quite as well as they did caesar or antony. instead, i should have just stuck to my reading.

dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the louisiana purchase lumber company.everyone in the state of louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. a member of the college's english department can only sign his name with an x.when it appears that a straight laced senator (victor moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish bob hope character.is it any wonder that vera zorina did not get the part of maria in 1943's "for whom the bell tolls?"naturally, the corrupt officials along with hope try to show pictures of zorina with moore so as to ruin him politically. moore marries the head of the restaurant who he had insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. he thought the reason that she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. this is the extent of humor is this absolute mess of a film.when hope tries to defend himself in congress, he does a take-off of james stewart in "mr. smith goes to washington." by then the film is too far gone for any good response.the music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible. that song praising louisiana, sung in various ways, is absolutely terrible. irving berlin had something to do with the music of this utterly terrible film?

this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century brazil. the story is interesting and edifying. however, this film -- as a film -- is terrible.the soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. it is afro-brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves' heroism. the special effects are absurd. rather than invoke the mysticism of african religion and atavistic beliefs, they merely make the film look cheap. they are completely unbelievable, and i don't mean merely in a sense of verisimilitude.life within the commune of palmares could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film. for this society, as shown in the film, is one-part kibbutz, one-part afro-pop festival. moreover, it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. he portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of '80s pop music. on the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful food, but the viewer hardly sees any work being done. the king inveighs against private property in a hackneyed and clichéd way. when a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months, the king says, "what comes from the earth belongs to everyone, as the earth belongs to no one. if they need food, they have a right to take yours."i am glad that i learned about this episode in history, but i am relieved that a film with such low production values and that trades upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today.

ham-handed homage to honest hacking. felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography, until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.basically a muddled '90s remake of '85's "real genius", with fewer and stupider geniuses, and a cynical bad ending.perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental. or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself. the movies closing credits song is more interesting than the movie itself.

computer savvy john light (as john elias) goes from stanford drop-out to successful young dotcom-era tycoon. but, mr. light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like ambitious jeffrey donovan (as robert jennings). mr. donovan used to bed down with light's girlfriend, megan dodds (as lisa forrester). donovan wants light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. after reading a naughty internet sex session, ms. dodds shines light on. he may lose is "digital dreams" internet empire, too! veterans unsuccessfully trying to lending dramatic gravitas include red lollipop-sucking mia farrow (as anna simmons) and quick-drawing, computer-hating hal holbrook (as tom walker). ms. farrow looks sweet with her lollipops.*** purpose (2/21/02) alan lazar ~ john light, jeffrey donovan, mia farrow

that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising. in our post-enron era, do we really need any more reminders of america's obsession with the greed creed? the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort, but will respond with barely concealed rage. it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces.what's really irksome with these kinds of films, including "purpose", is their pretense that behind the glitter, there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile. in "purpose", i found no such meaningful message. what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth. the two main characters, nauseating in their glibness, do very little actual work. instead, they party, they play golf, they strut their coolness, they sound "hip" with dialogue straight out of mtv-culture-speak: "rock my world", and "now get back to partying; that's an order". john is smug, self-important, shallow, and smirks a lot. robert, who wears funky little glasses, is even worse.the film includes two youthful garage geeks, who look and sound like they're right out of the film "antitrust" (2001). stereotypes are played for all they're worth, and in this film also include chic-looking computer equipment, and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can-do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy-duty partying. and with the time-bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates, can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years?about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco. the film would have been a lot more enjoyable, a lot more entertaining, if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story, and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration.

i was forced to watch this film for my world reigonal geography class. this film is what is wrong with america today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault. this film goes through the downfall of flint, michigan and blames it 100% on general motors. in the process of doing so moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of general motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society. moore films several evictions throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a gm layoff. additionally, he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed. moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda.

during university, our philosophy professor, mr.r, played us "roger & me" in its entirety. this was at a time when the obese misfit was still pretty much unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a soon-to-be-household-name who was still busy honing his fact-bending skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless, and the laughably gullible among ye.as we finished viewing it, i thought: "yeah, it was somewhat entertaining - in a totally daft bugs bunny kind of way - but what an ultra-biased, anti-capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity whatsoever this is; its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the film's creator has pet-peeves for. this isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination." however, our beloved marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with r&m, and we ended up not only not criticizing any aspects of it, but mr.r actually spent the remainder of class praising its "qualities". just so we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "left-wing extremist", or "selective fact presentation" never exited his perpetually smiling mouth... and just to remind you: this was supposed to be a philosophy class, not indoctrinate your students with your own political b.s. course.anyway, now i get to the really interesting aspect: this professor, mr.r, is now a highly successful screenwriter in hollywood. he has written several left-wing scripts with a-grade stars in them.the moral of the story: those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in hollywood.michael moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond a smidgen of a doubt with "canadian bacon"), but being a marxist liberal opens doors to just about anyone. tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-chavez extremists, hence why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part-and-parcel of the hollywood experience for many decades now.embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever.

leni riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda moore tries to call "humor". that this movie, and moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.let's see if we can bait foreigners. let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. let's see if we can pretend we're funny. let's see if we can out-isolationist charles lindbergh. the only thing moore lacks in comparison to lindbergh is a medal from göring.admittedly, in this film, moore had a bit of self-deprecation to his schtick. in this film, moore mocks roger smith, ceo of general motors, as an aloof, uncaring elitist. moore could do that in 1989, but now that moore has surrendered himself to aloof, uncaring elitism, this characterization of roger smith has an ironic twinge. who really wouldn't rather be roger's buddy than michael moore's?

blake edwards tried very hard to change julie andrews image in this film. he tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was. i think they were both still a bit irked that julie had not been chosen to film her broadway success of camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough. unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief. it gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing rock hudson, who we all know now was gay, kissing julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. it seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that julie was a femme fatale but that rock was straight. sadly, they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out. the other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making. it is almost three separate movies. there is the drama of julie as the german spy trying to get military secrets from rock. there is an air war movie with lots of footage of wwi vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that blake edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not, in this case, it was not. the only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely dame julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano. of course if you love her, you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her. you can always tell yourself, afterward, that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through star!

childish storyline ripped off of a lame hollywood movie, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and not quite "up-to-par" sex scenes. that's right another great softcore parody! i enjoyed this film greatly! sure the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! the storyline is ludicrous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. and because it's only softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a little bland. but it's like the great god of softcore smut russ meyers said "who really cares what goes down beneath the waist." i don't know if i'd agree with mr. meyers on this one but what the hell... the flick entertained me for an hour and a half. i give it a c+, it would've been a solid b if they coulda cast more of the girls to look like russ meyers actresses. vavoom! vavoom!~

***tip: have it read to you, heres how***1) copy and paste this to notepad (not word) 2) go to. start>all programs>accessories>accessabilty>narratorhaving your testicles ironed.when jonathan ross started his career he was on a show call "the last resort" now a days he is the first resort to host anything and anything. tv award shows that half the time he is up for nominations in, comic relief, chat shows, quiz shows, game shows, charity shows, brighton. just when you at you wits end and think you can find salvation in the wireless the lisping twang of good old j.r. hits you like a freight train going none stop from texas to downtown n.y. that has lost a hour and is trying to make it up.about this show (fnwjr).its a normal chat show format with j.r. as host and a house band that concisest of four gay men (ha ha ha, ow my aching sides.) and season one had andy davis, but he left or was fired to give way to ross's ego.ross will more less use his guests as props and you really don't hear them speak because of his "its my ball and i'll take it home" attitude, you also see that the bigger the guest the more he is willing to lie and suck up to them, to get in with the big boys (like the weak kid at school who hangs round with the bully).however when a small reality t.v. star comes on he'll happily humiliate them, asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their lack of talent to get the laughs. sometimes he will under estimate the popularity of a guest, say something to belittle them and then when the audience act shocked, he will quickly turn and start making himself the fall guy, the best example of this was when "life on mars" star john simm came on and he said how does someone like you get work, your ok looking but not hollywood good-looking (bare in mind the hugh jackman and halle berry was in the green room, he was really only trying to suck up to them before they were even on the couch). when the audience acted shock ross quickly said "what, i'm bit light headed from wearing that corset, i don't know what i'm saying". if he don't have any low forms of tv life on he'll just dig at the four gay men on the piano with jokes more out of date than his fashion.its very much a different story when a hollywood a-lister or big tv star comes on the show in that he'll tell them stories to humor them. when some actor explains that he was in a support band then jonathon ross will say something like "wow, well he ever i go to see a band i was try to look interested for the support band, to make them feel as though they are wanted" with an underline message being "please like me, i was probably one of the people that cheered you when you was in your band". top this off with an audience of ross fans so hooked on every bad old joke and bulling, it really makes for a poor show.your better off watching us chat shows instead, they are more scripted but not anywhere near as hard to watch.

any evening with jonathan ross now means to me his wit in first hassling and upsetting with carefully chosen words a 78 year old man by phone and then suggesting he and russell brand should house-break and masturbate him while he slept as a way to say sorry for making obscene phone calls to him. kinky! and illegal. for a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well, like his boss? or a follower of abu hamza? would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters?over all the years i've perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of bbc star man ross's chat show because i find him so loathsome, some of the guests i saw were ok though - probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know. as a chat show it seems pretty poor though  what's so chatty about asking tory leader david cameron on this tv programme whether he ever masturbated to photographs of margaret thatcher? he chatted up gwyneth paltrow by simply asking her if she wanted to f*** him. however, ross's yob mentality was finally totally exposed with the above revelations, and i thought i'd take the opportunity to warn the few decent folk around the world who might not know just how vile this man is and to steer clear of him and his - unless you think all comedy should be "edgy" ie obscene/vacuous. we're not yet all the same here, although bbc and channel 4 are jettisoning all standards.in october 2008 ross with fellow tosser russell brand made a series of premeditated sexual obscene phone calls to andrew sachs' answer-phone (manuel from fawlty towers), had it broadcast as intended on bbc national radio against sachs' request and then tried to get sachs' granddaughter to burn the evidence in case they got prosecuted. a significant number of people over here (probably most of them non bbc license fee payers) found it hilarious and/or that the national scandal had been overblown, but many people apparently still knew right from wrong and 42,851 eventually complained to bbc about the incident. many unrighteous media fools and others snickered about these 42,851 never having heard the radio programme (and never wanting to) - using their argument they presumably also consider an event such as the holocaust justified because at the time relatively few people complained to the media, and none of us here now should be horrified by it because we weren't there. the 2 bbc producers initially involved in passing it for broadcast thought it was "very funny and brilliant" comedy and only 2 people complained about brand's radio programme at the time - which i'm afraid only indicated the moral level his 400,000 weekly listeners had sunk to with the help of bbc expertise. highly moral bbc tried and failed to use it in mitigation in the later ofcom investigation. roll over aristotle, tell lord reith the news! sachs' agent complained to bbc but was ignored by them until a tory national newspaper got hold of the story. the penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally be sacking and prosecution, maybe even prison, but while brand and the head of bbc radio 2 were both eventually ordered to resign the multi-millionaire ross was given a 12 week holiday by bbc's boss (i suppose that he asked ross's permission first though if he could dock ross's pay by £1,500,000, to prevent him from suing) to come back to this programme afresh in 2009 before his contract runs out. all that time to think of more smut and/or more insulting witlessness for his 4,000,000 viewers to admire - but at least he could still chortle his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up. some people think that his position will be untenable and he won't be able to carry on. i think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back unbowed and re-energised with pent up vitriol. (update 23.01.09: i've just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series - the "most enormous cock-up" - to use his referential phrase - is continuing to allow this sniggering unrepentant law-breaker to take the public's money like this.) but who knows: maybe in the future after the slimy british film & tv industries have comforted him for the moral stance taken by the 42,851 and showered him with awards he will become a sir for his services to perversion by the perverts in government. at the least i hope this pair of edgy deviants sign up with other perverted commercial tv and radio stations and stay there, so i won't be paying for their flouting the law and spouting illegal obscenities in the future. in 2009 ofcom fined british tv license-fee payers £150,000 for this "sorry" affair - thanks ross for offering to pay! not.to the apologists: get a life/sense of humour/sense of proportion! it's not the end of the world having a pair of talentless perverts as your heroes and there's far more important things to worry about in this world, like the price of real cheese! to sum up family man dross: a comedy genius to apparently millions of people (especially himself), merely a nasty obscene phone caller receiving an obscene wage packet from an obscene multimedia company to others. so much for our society of political correctness and respect! as you should've guessed, it doesn't apply to the rich and famous and never will, but only to the poor. to sum up bbc: stumbling blindly on from huttongate, campbellgate, dykegate, springergate, crowngate, phonegate now rossgate i hope its next crisis will be abolitiongate. i also hope anyone who thinks comedy should be always challenging and pushing back boundaries ie offensive aren't challenged or offended by my opinion of this particular law-breaking pervert, his perverted programmes and his current perverted employers.

friday night with jonathan ross must have those in charge of ross rubbing their sweaty little palms together. they know the bbc lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows so when they have jonathan ross at their disposal they are quite settled to just sit back and let a half wit command this primetime slot.ross spends most of the show grooming his ego and smiling about how much the bbc is paying him. the show is a complete copy of many us chat shows - leno, letterman, conan o brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the uk also.the unfortunate situation - he has no competition? parkinson has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except grooming a celebs ego. can't we have someone funnier and slicker on british screens instead of jonathan ross? once ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room - so trying to get on with each other. if an a-lister is present (which is so often the case these days - as there are no other chat shows they can turn to - to promote their latest movie) - he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe. sqeamish when he had ringo starr on - a man that cares nothing for licking arse - ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number (as common policy on this show is for jonathan ross to get everyones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working). of course ringo said it how it is - and simply said no i don't like you - dead pan serious.ross needs to be axed from all awards and tv shows - the masses will get over it.

i loved so much last bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece "l'ora di religione". it had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.well, buongiorno notte is a different story. ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...). poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!). bad use of music: what's the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of brigate rosse?and to all the people who claimed the main prize in venice, i answer:"are you nuts????" maybe the russian film was bad but not as bad as this.i'm down with the p.e. don't believe the hype!!!!

most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! it takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film, one supposes. some have merely called the film "contemplative", meaning slow and devoid of plot, however, one dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene. here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on. so does just about every other character!the only silences in this picture are dream sequences--1930's soviet propaganda snippets--and they are also its most interesting parts. this tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is.the device of filming most of the scenes in extreme closeup--as if one were looking through a crack in the blinds--gets old fast.

unfortunately a boring flick, and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg public domain version, which is so blurry and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is. the leading actors are a nuisance. the man spends most of his screen time trying to appear nonchalant, charming and sexy, forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a goose to start with. the dame herself merely walks through the flick, being dignified if she's not busy appearing cute. it's a rather badly written stuff, never interesting or witty. no good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets. it only scratches the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this totally missable flick.

low budget mystery. a shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. a young architect jimmy mcmillan(chick chandler)discovers a dead body that goes missing. the woman in a hurry, mary(june clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is mcmillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. all the atmosphere of film-noir; but not quite the real thing. this flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape. other players include: george meeker, michael raffetto, milton wallace and rebel randall.

think jumanji but with a death curse. a bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the spanish inquisition and carries a nasty curse. okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before.frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. far from the worst thing that syfy has run but certainly its not the best. there are better choices out there but if this is your only choice you won't completely hate it.

i have to say this is better than most syfy outings, but that isn't saying much.the plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the spanish inquisition (and nobody ever expects the spanish inquisition!) he and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.what then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the final destination movies. it has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring back his family... but otherwise, it's just a mess.

ok, so i know better than to watch movies on scifi . . . er, sorry . . . syfy. or shifafa. or whatever it is now. so sue me. i spent my whole saturday doing advisory-board brainstorming for a nonprofit. i can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie i'd never seen, rather than read proust in the original or learn how to play the oud.which is to say, i didn't deserve open graves. of which i saw none, incidentally. were there any? did i fall asleep? why is it called this?some icky visuals. not many scares. as with too many films in modern horror films, no reasons are given--apart from shared humanity--to care about any of these people. half a point, though, for the legless entrepreneur, who was clichéd but did have one good scene.it all sort of plays like final destination delivered via a board game. the game does have an intriguing look to it, and it involves one of my favorite old conundrums. i'll give it that much. the drawback there is that the game possessed more personality than most of the characters.as for the end, if you didn't see it coming, then i think you fell asleep. somewhere back around the dawn of the genre.

the plot of "open graves" is very simple:it's about a board game called mamba,where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game.laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes.the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense.i liked eliza dushku in "wrong turn",but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here.the climax with cgi-witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid.the only reason to see "open graves" are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushku.if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up.give me any 70's or 80's low-budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap.a generous 3 out of 10.

this movie was terrible. the acting was lame, but it's hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad. this is one of johnny depp's worst movies- i highly discourage anyone from watching it.if you must see cry-baby though, i recommend muting it and simply ogling at mr. depp for and hour and a half.

maybe i was to young when i saw it. perhaps i have not grown up with grease and elvis movies.i failed to get it. i get "black" comedy (black adder etc.). i get irony and spoofs. i don't get this one though.i made it a quest to find out the name of this movie (enlisting the help of people on usenet and the most excellent imdb message boards) so it could be my first 1-pointer. awful!

john waters owes me 2 hours of my life back. i saw a sneak-preview screening of this way back in 1990, and i'm still in pain. not before or since have i seen such a terrible piece of filmic waste spewed upon the screen. there is nothing positive i can say about this film. acting--awful; plot--ridiculous; music--atrocious. following the movie, my friends and i demanded our money back from the manager of the theater. he explained that, since it was a free screening, he couldn't give us anything in return, no matter how much agony we were suffering through. how johnny depp's career survived this trainwreck of a movie is anyone's guess.

this movie was pure genius. john waters is brilliant. it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago. the acting is great, although ricki lake could have been better. and johnny depp is magnificent. he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. and seeing most of johnny's movies, this is probably my favorite. i give it 9.5/10. rent it today!

waters's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope, and then when/if something is found (by sheer chance and lots of luck) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.and after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's "rubbish bin for totally useless things". one single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.cb is etremely campy, and intentionally so. the usual jw stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, chewing-gum pop, overacting etc. waters knows that he is incabaple of making a movie of quality, so he hides behind the mask of the "intentionally cheesy film-maker" - which supposedly makes him a special kind of "anti-artist". but in the world of cinema, being an anti-talent often gets mistaken for talent, which is exactly what waters had hoped for - and eventually got. it's a con act. charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art; it's a plague.perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring baz luhrman to make all those horrible, dumb turkeys. it's like a virus: one waters creates five new bad directors, and then these five each create more, and so on. where will it end? with "dancer in the dark"? can that bomb actually be topped?

1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (dir-john waters): corny waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. john waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with johnny depp playing the title role. this movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled "hairspray" but this one is not as effective. some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone. the storyline is similar to the movie "grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. the guy from the bad group, cry baby, wow's a girl from the good group. the good girl then joins the bad group but once cry baby hurts her -- she falls back to the good group. this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back. now, one difference that is expected in water's movies is that the bad group doesn't appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you-know-what. i definitely saw this in hairspray, as well. the wacky and goofiness isn't really all that much fun in this movie, though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better. the prime appeal of the johnny depp character is that he's able to make one tear roll down his cheek(thus his namesake) at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him. this is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is ok, but not that great.

heh...i'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! this flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the t&a and the cheap laughs. the story line crosses a bit of "texas chainsaw massacre" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of "psycho", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy! looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of quebec pass off as southern u.s. bayou land is sad, i tell ya! funny thing for me is, i was actually at the premier of this flick as, at the time, i was pals with ratchford, the film's "star". it was painful to watch on as jeremy sank into his seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wings.i'm happy to see that ratchford, after this sham of a first flick, has grown into one hell of an actor. he can be seen regularly on the canadian cop drama "blue murder", has appeared on "csi", not to mention his role in the classic clint eastwood film "unforgiven" - we forgive ya, jeremy! it was a rocky start, but you done good, man! ~t.paul

we've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. i've seen that junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and i was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to texas chainsaw massacre, so i thought i'd get it. mistake! junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. in other words it's really bad. although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. avoid!!

up at the villa fooled me into thinking i`d be watching something similar to gosford park . the film opens at a ballroom in 1930s italy which is populated by vulgar americans and uptight upper class brits , but in truth up at the villa plays out far more like a merchant -ivory production which is very bad news because it`s a very slow , and i do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely . if you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie . i didn`t

can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again. i got to just where they are in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiles. what happens after that? is there anymore dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better. i love kristen scott thomas does anyone remember the uk tv series she was in about some nuns? i am wanting to know the name. sean penn was brilliant madonna eat your heart out! everybody else in fact the film a bit predictable, it was a 'spot a star cast'. the ending took me by surprise i really thought she had burnt her boats.....if you are a fan of any of the stars its worth watching.

boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.it's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent kst movies (e.g. the english patient), but have far less appeal.after the first half-hour i started checking my watch, wondering if i'd make it home in time to catch leno on tv.i passed up "gladiator" to see this!?!

up at the villa (2000) **1/2warning: you may find some spoilers aheadit's hard to know what is the point in up at the villa, a gorgeous but shallow period piece, one of those made with the only objective of earning oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). it has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her. she has many difficulties but ultimately finds her happiness in the arms of a man that is not the one that she had an accomplishment with. in this case, our lady is in florence, some time before world war ii. she is an english widow engaged to a rich-but-old man (whom, obviously, she doesn't love). one day she meets another man, who has not a good reputation but for whom she falls in love. of course there is her friend who will help her for better or worse and a third man- who commits suicide here, in the lady's room, setting up a risky situation for her. guess how the story ends...?up at the villa is not a bad film. i was always quite interested in the story, but never got excited. the problem is not the slow pacing, but the screenplay. adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and suspense. every time you think the story will get warm, it gets cooler again. if you think there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of florence, well, there is, but it doesn't change almost anything in the story. it just keeps going and going, till the predictable ending.as i said, up at the villa is not bad. if it is a bit bland, it never gets sappy and too sentimental. the acting is half and half, but surely convinces. kristin scott thomas made some really bad choices after the english patient (the saaaaaaappy romantic drama the horse whisperer and the dull/irritating random hearts). up at the villa is undoubtly better than those pieces and kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. sean penn is good as always, even if his character is a big dude. anne bancroft is a terrific actress (the graduate, my god!), and here she doesn't let her character become ridiculous. now, the supporting actors are pretty bad (jeremy davies is sooooooooooo irritating!).the directing is good, but not audacious. it was interesting to know that the director is the same of angels and insects (also starring kristin scott thomas), another so-so period drama, but more audacious than this. what matters here are the visuals. florence is wonderful, the costumes are great, the scenery, the music...in the end, up at the villa is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. it is watchable and interesting, but don't expect a suspense film- it is not! this film kind of fails because it wants to have some mystery, something to behold... however, there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow screenplay. now, about the oscar nominations, don't worry- it will probably get them.

let me be clear. i hate these kinds of movies. i do not like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeoisie english. i find this kind of literature and film awfully pretentious. you will never get me to read a jane austen book willingly. that said, the only reason i read w. somerset maugham's book and watched the subsequent film was for a class.mary panton (kristin scott thomas) is a beautiful english woman living in a borrowed villa in florence before world war ii. one night after dinning with some of her rich royalty related friends, she willingly picks up an austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then he kills himself. as the movie gets further and further, you really want to dislike mary.what a load of crap this movie was. first of all, there were many subplots and characters invented in the movie that weren't even in the book. i doubt very much the late mr. maugham would've appreciated them. the characters, though wealthy, were some of the most superficial and self-centered people i have ever seen.the only reason i didn't give it anything less than three stars was because the acting was the only thing redeemable. the always talented kristin scott thomas is perfect for the role of mary. in fact, i couldn't picture anybody else filling her shoes. sean penn and anne bancroft also had supporting roles, that were just as good as the lead.save yourself the pain of watching this movie.

well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for pre wwii italy. but what happened here? great actors...kristin scott thomas, sean penn, anne bancroft, james fox, derek jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `a list' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. i rented this on dvd after having liked "angels & insects" (1995) also directed by philip haas. yipes! i can hardly believe how dull this thing was. it just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing. this is not even a good intriguing-foreign-dudes-and-young-things-in- pretty-clothes chick flick!"tea with mussolini" gone amuck!

i grew up watching the "bowery boys" on the weekends and even at young an age i could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. still it was fun to watch satch (hall) get the better of muggs (gorcey) after muggs would beat the crap out him. the east side kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. enter the year 2005 and i am repossesin about my childhood. i can't find any bowery boys on dvd but i found the east side kids on disc and also on a public domain website. thankfully i saved my dough and saw bowery blitz on the web for free, and it really really blows. now i can see there are some bowery boys and maybe monogram bad movie lovers here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 of 10 but c'mon folks, this ain't even trying to be funny. it's an east side kids drama, not a comedy so it's no good. the best part was seeing muggs fight at the end, he reminded me of my grade school days flayling away like a girl when i would get in a fight, it was kinda abusin. leonard maltin said in his mini bio that this flick is one of the better ones, so you can just imagine the rest. if you wanna see some halfway decent east side action see ghosts on the loose maybe but the bottom line is usually a comedy team starts out strong in their career and tapers off, these mugs blew chucks early on then slowly picked it up until hall's antics dominated than they were at best. still 2nd tier stuff way below the 3 stooges, who they imitate but amusing for those who grew up with them. this feature won't bring back pleasant "bowery boys" memories and is best left to monogram fanatics.

"the final comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and inner-city violence; unfortunately, the message is invalidated by the nonsensical script, the amateurish production, and the heavy-handed polemics. how heavy-handed, you ask? to give you just one example, a black doctor comes out of his hiding place, unarmed, with his hands up in the air, ready to surrender to the police: one of the (all-white) cops says "don't shoot him, he's a doctor", to which another cop replies: "so what? he's still a n****r", and proceeds to shoot him in cold blood. the cops are portrayed as ignorant, racist killers, even though at the end there are just as many dead people among them as there are among the black people who staged the riot. and this whole event was meant somehow to "sensitize" the white folks to the demeaning treatment of the black folks, when in fact something like this can only breed more hate and violence on both sides. pamela jones, as williams' girlfriend, briefly lights up the screen with her smile and body, particularly in a tender sex scene, and elevates the rating of this movie from 1 to 2 out of 10.

first of all i dunno if i was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! here we go....basically there were so many years and gaps that i don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? i think this is a big flow. forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws. so most of the people keep saying watch this in cinema you will lose all cinematography like rivers, deserts etc.. thats true they are beautiful thats why i waited for bluray release 1080p. ok! beautiful scenes but whats the point of that? i turned off the movie after 1 hour and half, i just lost interest. the movie kept on doing the exact same things jumping in years ( at least mr. director put for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) i mean i couldn't watch the movie i lost understanding of whats going on! anyways i wish i could include spoilers but when u decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how did this happen? you will know what i mean! don't watch this movie its a waste of time.

for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. used too many non native speakers especially jamukha. too many diversions from the actual history. terrible terrible subtitle!!! i wonder where and who did that subtitle. it was both in english and thai. i wonder how bad the subtitle was in thai if the english subtitle was soooo bad! described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting. there are better films made by mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's. honestly, i'm wondering if the film critics of academy award is that lenient or what? only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately... not over the top cgi

this film did not excite me. while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. the action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.one thing that i did not quite follow is how borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of khan's life. it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long. overall, i rate this movie a (4) because i enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed...

please -- if you haven't attempted to sit through this garbage and are considering viewing this flick/mini-series -- do yourself a favor and find anything else to do. floss your teeth, start learning to play the cello, beat your dog -- anything you choose will be time better spent than watching this junk. this is not a bad movie that you can get a few chuckles out of -- it simply sucks in every way possible. just boring from beginning to end.and for those animal lovers out there that feel my comment above is insensitive -- if your dog could speak, he or she would beg for a beating rather than suffer through watching this mess.

i remember when this show came out. it was originally advertised as a mini-series. at the end of the last episode it said "to be continued" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. it ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. the plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more. quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public, when the truth is that for this show that is not the case, it ended the way it was actually planned to end, it is just a lousy ending.

firstly, this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book, short story, novella, or anything else. from ew's web site, and their review on the show when it first aired, "...he never writes down to his audience, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. his first original work for television, stephen king's ''golden years'' (cbs, july 16, 9-11 p.m.), is no exception."the series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on. but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all ends??when the series came out on videotape, it touted itself as having the "never-before-seen ending!" it should have said, "the should-never-be-seen ending!" *** spoiler ***the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video (though parts of the whole were left out), and that changed ending was what destroyed the story. for example, rather than our two intrepid fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop (as originally broadcast), jude simply walks up to them... and they shoot him. bang, dead, and no real emotion to speak of in the scene. ditto on the bit with harlan and his wife going poof. whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff-hanger, on the video, they simply get out of the cock-a-doodie car.*** end spoiler ***it was a sad ending to a rather well made mini-series, and makes the video completely not worth buying, or even renting. sincerely, save your money and your time.

when this series aired i watched most of it. i think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of "the fugitive" and "the incredible hulk" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. in this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. i liked what i saw of these shows. the acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. problem is: they cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or i missed the last episodes).they never got a chance to wrap up the story either, knowing it had been cancelled. poof it was just gone. however, like i said before i might have missed the last episodes. but my proof to the contrary is this: i rented the tape. where i left off in the series. the lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving king's famous organization the shop. while getting away hero is kidnapped. it ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the shop. the end. last episode. on the video: his wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. right when he should get nabbed by the shop, he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. they just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. they might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. almost pythonesque.the show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the david bowie song of the same name

dreadful. i hope i can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this. i just finished watching the film, btw.i love good cross genre films. this isn't one of them. show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, i'll watch them all. but you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock-horror fest and draw my applause.i love philosophical films. this isn't one of them. anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately. or ever. the "thought-provoking" dialogue is trite, at best. perhaps it lost something in the translation.i love a good horror-comedy. this isn't one of them. laugh! i thought i'd never start! squirm? only when trying to think of a polite way to phrase my feedback of the film to the friend who recommended it.rupert is incongruously good in the setting of this film, but even he cannot resurrect it. i only wish he had shot the director instead if the zombies.for shame, that the land that gave rise to the inferno should also give rise to this. dante would be spinning in his grave.

in michele soavi's confusing art-house zombie film, dellamorte dellamore, rupert everett plays francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long. aided by his simple assistant, gnaghi, francesco deals with the cemetery's zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade.however, soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently interred, francesco finds himself busier than ever beforehaving garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of imdb's more respected horror officianados, i decided to see what the fuss was all about. i've just finished watching the film, and i can honestly say that i haven't been this disappointed by a horror film for quite some time.with its dreary, muddled pseudo-philosophical plot, and an extremely bland performance from leading man everett, dellamorte dellamore is an irritating and plodding mess that not even some splattery gore (courtesy of sergio stivaletti) and welcome gratuitous nudity (from busty anna fialchi) can save. i am at a loss to understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious bilge has received from its misguided fans.

i am utterly astonished at how over-rated "cemetery man" is among horror fans! now, i usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre-styles into one and i love just about every zombie-comedy i have ever seen. to my dismay, this italian cult-classic really didn't show me a lot to get too pumped up about... it follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery care-taker and his retarded, man-child, curly joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death. he meets a widow whom he "wows" with some grisly grave-yard atmosphere and develops a quick romance, soon having sex with her on her dead husband's grave. the husband's corpse springs alive and bites her, triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the movie. "cemetery man" attempts to incorporate every element it can, like horror, romance, comedy, action, and fails entirely in the long-run. it plods along, never able to focus on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer, such as the paunchy sidekick's relationship with a living severed head, a motorcycle riding zombie launching out of the ground, the main character deciding to gun down random people on the sidewalk, etc. this thing is so convoluted and dull that it's nearly impossible to take it seriously. sure, it's stylish and often "elegant", but even the most "artsy" kind of films need the right kind of lineage to allow it to make sense. "cemetery man" plods along, appearing unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes which becomes very tiring after a while. people argue that "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie". frankly, when it comes to zombies, i don't want anything more "sophisticated" than romero... there's a little bit of gore and nudity - mainly in the scenes where it wants to play "horror movie", but not nearly enough to make up for it's uncompromising lack of structure. terrible film.

the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style, because there's absolutely no substance. a bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.it's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. there's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. these elements undermine each other. just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex. to keep from screaming with boredom, you clutch at the minimal story line - and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic. it's like someone took several half-baked b movies and tossed them in a blender.what comes out is mostly a film *about* meaninglessness - and *not* a good one. clearly, it will impress that category of art-house fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess.

the script is very weak & there is no depth in the characters. the story telling is not the importing thing here. the unnecessary action & scenes does not really help this one. one of the worst movies in sweden´s history of films.

if this movie would have been in english, all critics would have trashed it. the language is extremely bad, the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny. after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, on dogs as well...) the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. of course the public chose jalla! jalla! while vingar av glas got little attention.what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad. that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it, for fun i suppose. the result, however, is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them. this was very frustrating. maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master.another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together. at several times in the middle of the movie, the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable. and then i have not mentioned the 2-dimensional characters, especially those in the supporting roles. even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated, it is kind of understandable that the public liked it. i mean, bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses...i'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it. they should have known better...grade 2 of 10

lame. lame. lame. ultralame. shall i go on? there is one, i repeat *one* funny scene in this entire, drawn-out, anti-amusing amateur hour special of a film: fares fares' fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut. that's it. the rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored-looking swedish "actors" delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other, a banal story, sloppy direction and, well, little else worth mentioning. nepotistically cast fares fares is as charismatic as a chartered accountant and his nose rivals even that of adrien brody in terms of sheer ridiculous hugeness. torkel petersson should only work with lasse spang olsen. the rest of the cast is, luckily, easily forgettable, whereas fares' humongous, titanic nose will forever haunt me in my dreams.josef fares helps ruin swedish cinema. don't support him and his nonsense. jalla jalla is to comedies what arnold schwarzenegger is to character acting, kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a no-budget youtube video, and zozo was simply the most pretentious, pseudo-touching garbage ever unleashed by a swedish director. wake up and smell the roses: swedish movies can be so much better than this, so stop pretending fares' flicks are worth watching simply because they're "good to be swedish". please.

secret service agent jay killion (charles bronson) has been assigned to protect the president-elect's wife, the new first lady (jill ireland). she is a very difficult woman and killion has his hands full. she is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the president's chief of staff, who wants the first lady dead. this movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line, but also with the lack of realistic locations. for example, in the scene depicting the inaugural parade, the first lady is in a rolls royce convertible with agent killion and without the president. also, we know what washington, dc, is like weather wise in january, and not only is everybody "top coat less", you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather! (obviously filmed in hollywood, not washington, dc). this movie is a joke. it is not worth your time.

charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen. but this movie lacks everything that a thriller/action-movie should have. there are a few action scenes in the movie, but they're really crappy. and when the action scenes fail, does the story save the film? not at all, is my answer to that. the story is even worse than the action scenes. it's very straightforward and boring, and even though i'm a big movie fan, i almost fell asleep several times. i don't know how they came up with a failure like this. a low budget, maybe? regardless of that, it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all. when that happens, the result is really bad.

as much as i love the story of david copperfield, i cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen. one problem i see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. it is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. i dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. it was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp. also, i don't think the filmmakers interpreted copperfield's personality correctly. the idea of him strolling around on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive, forward-thinking nature dickens gave him in the novel. agnes also bothered me. she came across as a ditsy household decoration, rather than a strong woman. dora was perfect, however. this movie was fraught with problems, and i wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version.

while killing time on a saturday morning, "looking for lola" came on hbo. i decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. it was even worse than i could imagine. the movie was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no on-screen chemistry between the lead actors that i found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. between mike greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes in which he skips the bill at a fancy restaurant and where lola (lead actress) allows him to use her boss' house to fool his parents into thinking he's rich, it was almost as bad as him "daydreaming" about people around him doing the macarena (it was horrible!) and the two actors ultimately falling in love. i kept wanting to change the channel, but i was trying to give it every chance into becoming a cute love story with a few chuckles. it never did. in fact, it became so bad that i decided to finish it just so i can claim that i watched one of the worst films ever made in it's entirety, instead of being criticized for not "giving it a fair chance". the last scene where lola tries out for a dance part was the culmination of the movie. she comes in late after getting married (even that scene where mike tells the priest to hurry up and then just snatches the papers away claiming that it's done was in tune with the believability of this movie), and then somehow "convinces" the judges to give her a look. the two male judges are already put-off with how late she is. but after watching her waif around the stage (ok, she dances fine, but not overly impressive), everybody joins in including lola and mike's families, other dancers that were there, and *cough* even the judges. bad, horrible, terrible. it was so bad i had to write a review. watch at your own risk.

this movie was so frustrating. everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time. i at least thought i'd be able to stand it. but, i was wrong. first, the weird looping? it was like watching "america's funniest home videos". the damn parents. i hated them so much. the stereo-typical latino family? i need to speak with the person responsible for this. we need to have a talk. that little girl who was always hanging on someone? i just hated her and had to mention it. now, the final scene transcends, i must say. it's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. what crappy dancing. horrible and beautiful at once.

james marsh's the king is a film that mystifies me. i can't think what its meant to be for. it's a story about a young man called elvis played by gael garcia bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years navy service and then goes off to find his biological father and behaves dishonourably with him and his family. it's all rather sick really. elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister malerie (pell james). it's rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in middle england. preacher father and bouncy joyful christian congregation; i couldn't work out whether the film is meant to be deriding them for their mindless beliefs. or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that's unviable. or is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction. it's shallow. we all know that bad things happen; the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever unravelling the thinking that has led to it. "the king" is such a lost opportunity. there are some really interesting questions about honour; the warrior code; the changing concepts of valour; honour killings in indian families and so on. honour is a very varied concept. but this film just adds nothing to the notion. however, paul the projectionist did more than his meagre role suggests. the dvd projector showed all films in a green-only hue and the only way to repair this was to get it sent to belgium. he did this through christmas. i think those postal workers and repairers and paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dismal film. but you might see it differently?

i am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of christian fundamentalism.that said, this movie is reprehensible, vile and transparent. it only works on the level of the currently fashionable (and tired) hatred motif of white american christian fundamentalism. had this movie been made about a fundamentalist jewish or muslim family, or even a black christian family, the outrage would have been palpable, and the movie would have been roundly panned in all circles. as it stands, though, it's "ok" and "artful" because white christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage such as this.and garbage it truly is. if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent, find and watch or review "badlands." nothing good was done in "the king" that wasn't done better decades ago in that masterful film.as other reviewers note, the characters are almost completely undeveloped in "the king," the lines are a snooze, the cinematography is lackluster. we've seen the tale of the sociopath done better 100 times. this movie doesn't cut it for thoughtful viewers.

if you are an insomniac and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie. if you are renting it for whatever other reason....dont!....this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen. the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason. i cant even write about this movie anymore...get it away from me!!!!!!!!

negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. everyone in this movie should attend overactors anonymous. you would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the pearl harbor bombing. it does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. the typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included). i could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and cliché characters. upon the completion of the movie, i had to throw the dvd in the trash. stay far away from this dud! you won't get the 90 minutes of your life back!

there was nothing remotely funny about this movie. it makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny. most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. non the main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film. also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage. thank goodness i only spent $4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on. only watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.

sometimes, things should just not be made. and while the set-up seemed good enough, it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror. but the problem is, its not another saw film. its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from jason voorhees.i lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film. and generally, it flopped in its attempts. true, telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first, but that grew tiring to watch. that and the joke about "radio" and "ipod".overall, i can't stand to watch this film again. even trantasia is worth more than this. "d-"

if it would of had jack black listed as the leading actor i would of stayed away from this movie right away. it actually makes some of his movies look good compared to this movie.this movie should of been filmed as a cartoon for ages 3-8 and it would of been a lot better. it is nothing but a bunch of the stupidest skits from other movies put together to make one big mess.the movie looks like it was shot in about one day with no thought at all behind it. there's a few times where it looks like maybe there's gonna be a turning point and the movie well actually have plot to the movie or at least a storyline would develop but the stupid skits inserted just ruin the whole movie.

im sorry to myself, you know why. i feel pained from the viewing of this movie. i went to the theater with some friends to see this movie, and still did not give it the satisfaction of watching it in entirety ( i left with about 20 minutes left... hoping to god it might make me at least comfortable for a moment. ) most movies now, even this bad ones... when i watch them, there may be a small part in the movie where i feel some joy at times because of maybe a quirky joke or a good line... this movie on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and mad at myself the whole time, especially since i wasted money on it. it was poorly written, poorly directed, poorly shot, and definitely poorly acted...please, for the good of humanity, do not see this movie, even if your some guy who wants to say he has seen like every movie ever... just don't...

the comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a good one. tom brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from gridiron gang, invincible and even miracle! to the longest yard and dodgeball-yes dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since airplane! well, he was wrong. they did such a slipshod job, you'd thought it was written in a week. i have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good. obviously, brady does not love the genre he is spoofing. this movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing, so don't see it!

when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie. i was wrong. all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others. some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.i feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as varsity blues, friday night lights, stick it, etc. and if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one. even the adult humor in this movie was dry. do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don't rent this movie

the spoof genre, which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already, gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent. no point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers. it takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. any clod can pick up a cam-corder, and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies, there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways, to get you to laugh hysterically. it doesn't work.that's not comedy. however, the same old worn out sophomoric "jokes" ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. if that's not enough, there's a running "gag" of a bus running somebody over. so funny, right? also, one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than michael bay; again with the same unfunny results. a musical bit flops miserably. pity carl weathers, once apollo creed in the rocky series, now stuck with roles in swill like this.lousy beyond words. watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. probably a lot funnier, too.

this movie is a nonsense/spoof comedy, in the lines of the airplane or naked gun, but it doesn't even come close to this two, because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes, rather then just throwing you with the same old easy jokes.you can figure out some references to other movies, from the top of my head i identified dodgeball and rocky, so you can have some fun with that, trying to find out what movies are spoofed.the movie also offers you an occasional laugh, but nothing that can cause you injuries, thus nothing really funny.i liked the character ipod in some ways (even though some of the jokes with him are standard comedy 101).i think this movie (and like most of nonsense/spoof comedy) depends on the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh to any joke watch this movie. if you are in a serious mood forget about this (re)watch the airplane instead, it will definitely make you laugh

with so many horrible spoof movies, this is sadly a breath of fresh air to the genre. compared to classics like airplane or the naked gun, this is awful, but compared to recent spoof movies like meet the spartans and disaster movie, this is very clever and original. don't get me wrong, though, this was not a good movie in any way. i laughed a few times, and there are a few inspired gags, but any pop culture reference falls flat on it's face, as does most jokes in the movie.lambeau fields (david koechner) was a bad coach in the past, but now he's brought back to teach college football, and this time he'll do a good job. his wife (melora hardin) is feeling distant from him and his daughter is dating a football big shot to spite her father. spoofs of various recent movies come into play, as do a lot of sight gags and nonstop stupidity.the best parts of the movie are the gags not relying on reference to recent movies. spoofs of radio, rocky, dodgeball, friday night lights, invincible and many other sports movies are not funny in the least. it's mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs, like a bizarre crotch scratching scene, or a chewing tobacco spitting joke. these little throwaway giggles cannot carry the movie, and by the end, it's hard to watch. the last 20 minutes are grueling to sit through.the characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie, however, i'm sure the characters were built on clichés from the genre. nonetheless, they're not too bad. david koechner can pull lead actor in a movie off. too bad they gave him so much crummy material to work with. matthew lawerence has fine comedic timing in a not always so comedic role as a ballet dancing football player with a cross dressing father. carl weathers rounds off the cast, once again playing in a sub-par sports movie (not the rocky movies...happy gilmore!) overall, this is a goofy comedy. at times, it's funny, but more often than not, it's just very annoying and predictable.my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.

spoof films have come so far since mel brooks in 'the producers' (1968) said "don't be stupid, be a smartie. come and join the nazi party". it brought us delightful films, such as 'young frankenstein', 'airplane!', and even 'naked gun'. but the good die young. luckily, the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's. and then... the wayan's brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'scary movie'. suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes. most movies claiming to be spoofs since then have followed suit, including 'scary movie 2', 'date movie' and the film to kill the genre 'epic movie'. sure, there have been some reliefs. there was 'shaun of the dead' and 'hot fuzz'. will ferell has become a vehicle spoofing close to every sport imaginable. also, the wayans brothers quit the 'scary movies' and they have been made by the dependable zucker brothers. while these films have held some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically doomed to be films only loved by prepubescent males who just discovered what an erection is. people who haven't explored the term 'spoof' and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh. no heart, no brain, just cheap glue. sadly, 'the comebacks' has been added to the list. dave koechner (who starred in 'anchorman' alongside ferrell) leads a teams of underdogs to win against a coach (carl weathers of 'happy gilmore' fame) who got him back into coaching. koechner has shown promise as a supporting actor, but as a lead in this film, he just sounds scripted. he sounds too much like he's doing a cold read passionately. also, the jokes about being a washed up coach, who through the course of the movie encourages the team to fail in school and later runs from the police in his underwear, have been done before. yes, this is a spoof film. but let us remember that even spoofs can have quality. give the characters dignity and a sort of sophisticated view on modern society. also, the reliance on stereotypes is not going to get us any more laughs (who knew one movie with jive-talking people could lead to gangster stereotypes (not really, but you see)). while i will admit to laugh at least a few times... it wasn't on par. the football team within itself had a lot of stereotypes, including a mexican, a cocky jock, a fat guy, the scrawny nerd, and the mentally handicapped aid. even the only female on the team got reduced to stereotypical female humor, being mostly scantily clad and giving off innuendos. in fact, her character, as well as most of the others, never developed. it's a sad state of affairs for this movie. if only it wasn't so reliant on stupid sex jokes, it could've made something for itself. in fact, this movie will probably be the butt of jokes alongside 'epic movie' for time to come. koechner really deserved better. the script in general was poorly conceived, even naming the championship 'the toilet bowl'. so yes. spoof movies are dying. there is a movie called 'meet the spartans' (be ahead of the trend, boycott now!) coming out that includes a spoof on britney spears' breakdown. so let those kids keep getting erections... but people grow up and lose them. we need sustenance. one day, they will learn to stop spoofing spoofs and restore them. hopefully, one of the heroes will be 'get smart', made by the master mel brooks, coming out next year. rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)

i lay the blame for the comebacks on anyone who enjoyed date movie and epic movie. you people encouraged the fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films, and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. the comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. this is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. no one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie. director tom brady (the hot chick) has made something truly wretched here.the plot, if you can even call it that, centers on a man named lambeau fields (david koechner). right when i heard his name within the first couple seconds of the film, i knew i was in for a long movie. funny names are seldom funny, and become even less funny the more you hear them. lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but he's been given another chance by his best friend, freddie wiseman (carl weathers), to coach a ragtag high school football team called the comebacks. lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them the ways of inspirational sports movie clichés. he expects his kids to have poor grades and problems with alcohol, and ridicules them when they don't. when it looks like the team has a chance to play at the big championship toilet bowl game (did 10-year-olds write this script?), lambeau is shocked to discover that freddie is the coach of the big rival team that his team will be playing against. turns out freddie only encouraged lambeau to take the coaching job, because he wanted the comebacks to lose.the comebacks is a movie so forced and pathetic, i almost had a hard time believing what i was watching. spoof movies have recently turned into a game of "spot the movie reference", and this continues the tradition. it tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports movies as it can, but it either does absolutely nothing with them, expecting us to just point at the screen and laugh out of familiarity, or it attempts to be funny and falls flat on its face. some of the films referenced include field of dreams, bend it like beckham, rocky balboa, friday night lights, stick it, radio, miracle, remember the titans, gridiron gang, invincible, and dodgeball: a true underdog story. but wait, wasn't dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies? so, in other words, we're watching a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies. if that makes any sense to you, you're just the audience this movie is looking for. some of these films are referenced in the plot, and some (like the rocky one) are just thrown in for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many films as possible. there are some that the movie even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue, just in case we've missed the obvious reference. you know a movie is in trouble when it has to spell out its own jokes to us.the worst thing is that the screenplay by tv veterans and first time screen writers, ed yeager and joey gutierrez, doesn't even know the first and most important rule of parody - you have to play it straight. the actors have to pretend they're not in on the joke. the reason why the classic zucker brothers movies like airplane, top secret, and the naked gun are remembered so fondly is because they cast serious actors like leslie nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before he turned to comedy) and robert stack, and then threw them into ridiculous situations. what made it funny is that they acted like they weren't in a comedy, and kept a stone face to the weirdness around them. those films wouldn't have worked if they played their roles broadly. the comebacks proves this, as all the actors are forced to play their roles so goofy, it's like they're screaming at us to laugh. david koechner keeps on flailing his arms, bulging his eyes, and screaming at the top of his lungs to the point he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a dead-end comedy, and just tries too hard to pretend he's having a good time. the movie also doesn't understand the art of celebrity cameos (also an important factor when it comes to parody films). what kind of cameos do we get in the comebacks? andy dick and dennis rodman.by the time the movie throws in an out of nowhere and extremely pointless cast musical number to journey's "don't stop believing" for absolutely no reason whatsoever, i was just about ready to walk out the theater door. i was the only person at my screening, and the thought of this movie going on its pathetic way to a completely empty house kind of appealed to me. i did sit through the rest of the comebacks, and i was not rewarded for my efforts. the sad thing is, fox is not yet done killing the spoof genre. they have a parody of 300 coming out next year called meet the spartans. i'd say it can't be much worse than this, but i've seen the trailer, and i wouldn't want to get your hopes up.

this film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the kennedy assassination. the are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out. it is a film of the kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been altered. there are missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limo passes the sign, don't fit in. both kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them. next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up, such as the texas gov. and his, along with the ss men in the front, lunge forward but you can see that the limo is not stopping or slowing down, in fact is is accelerating. this film is clearly an attempt at a cover up.

this is the worst hindi film i have ever seen. it conforms to all the stereotypes of bad hindi films. the plot is ridiculous, the acting over the top, and shah rukh manages to fit in a couple of song sequences even though he is playing the character of a dumb man.

there are times when, less than halfway through a movie, i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind. and i mean any kind. this movie doesn't even hold up as made-for-cable porn. in fact, heaven's tears is completely and utterly boring, and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete. the girl, who is, as i recall, eighteen, masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a car--the "bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves" syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films. then, on their second or third meeting--get this--he is the shy one, the one who is resistant to the girl's sexual advances, and yet, all she has to say is, "i'm old enough. i'm want to," and he takes her to bed. then, after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows, he feels completed, as if he could die right there in the bed with her and he'd have lived a full life. it's like "lolita" without a shred of social and personal commentary.the cinematography is the most boring part of the movie. no interesting angles or originality at all, not even for the sex scenes, which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies. the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girl's bed (very fake looking, as if it's on a stage), and it's interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall. the "i am completed" scene is just a close-up of the girl's right side (head down to her breasts) with the guy on top of her, and it's the same shot for the whole time, even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazi's older sister, who has some kind of incestuous crush on him (she's ridiculous and silly, so it doesn't matter). i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes, and it's neither enlightening nor arousing.

i chose to watch this film because i am a stephen nichols fan. unfortunately, i am unhappy with mr. nichols' choice to do this movie. the film was slow, badly acted, and included some very graphic sex scenes of mr. nichols' character with a very young woman. watch at your own peril!

your idol will deceive you in this movie. stephen nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. this makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. the character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. nichols, who is one of daytime tv's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl. it's like watching two animals going at it. if you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects, don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way. if, on the other hand, you want to see stephen nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera, you might like it: stephen will show you his naked butt, lots of tongue work, his groaning range, but not his talent as this character who's obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera. he may have found it kinky but i didn't - a big deception!

dictated by thin experience (of both life and industry) and no cash sofia coppola's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus. the cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b&w (it's difficult to tell the characters apart). the sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance.yet there are one or two things to note. inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots. the editing-to-music also creates an interest and momentum (without descent into the netherworld of the music video). coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film. the dramatic turn is cut fast and to-the-point and the second act is almost non-existent; we recognise it's actually been played out in tandem with the first, which is the point of the narrator-on-crutches trope (who is an otherwise curiously appended character in that first act).despite these notes it's an awkward short. 2/10

well, i must say, i initially found this short to be quite average, but having watched it nearly 5 times since (its constantly shown on ifc), i've developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented. sofia coppola contributes a solid addition to the category.

although this has to be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted. it's just that most of us looked to the x-files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made simpsons' halloween specials look like great thriller tv.in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker. however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town.there's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none-too-sophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks. it's nothing you'd want to see more than once!it's hard to figure out season 6. x-files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole 'syndicate conspiracy' story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers.

ok, this simply is the worst movie ever made. period. horrible acting, sets and music. ok, everything sucks in this movie. i almost forgot! the special effects are "great" also. so if you like bad movies, watch this, it can surely make you laugh!!

prey aspect ratio: 1.37:1sound format: monoa lesbian couple (sally faulkner and glory annan) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man (barry stokes) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion...despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing, norman j. warren's follow-up to satan's slave (1976) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff (apparently, his only writing credit): faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v. browne's eye-catching cinematography), though annan's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and 'left' under mysterious circumstances. stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. there's an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to 'emasculate' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, though stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery.in the early scenes, at least, the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner. the closing sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially annan's final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!). excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by warren's unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings. originally released in the us as alien prey.

a genuinely odd, surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page; just what drew robert redford to the project, one may never know. sidney j. furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing; the kid looks up to this anti-hero, and eventually begins to ape his amorality. disjointed and off-putting--though for some, the sight of redford disrobing, about to disrobe, or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention. lauren hutton gets naked too, however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient-minded; there simply is no story. perhaps furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970. if true, then this pre-blank generation approach backfired, as the film was not a success. *1/2 from ****

this appears to be two movies spliced into one. in the first, zasu pitts is a renegade in a small town. she wants to help the romantic life of marjorie woodworth. ok: i'd never heard of her before either. but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoction.before we know it, pitts is no longer miss {polly. she is emmie. i had to rewind to see if i'd fallen asleep somewhere. i hadn't. she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destination.the movie has some cute moments. the first part is better, with roles for what seems to be every third-rate character actress working in hollywood at the time.and what of ms. woolworth? she sounds a little like betty hutton. she sounds a little like marie wilson. she's pretty, certainly. but she's no comedienne.pitts often was used in very small roles. here she has the largest role. she's always fun, though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn't go quite a long way. (as a comic. when she was a tragic actress in von stroheim silents -- "the wedding march" and greed" are the two i have seen -- she was brilliant.)

it looked cool from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest. the film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film. may god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what i can only describe as my new one and only reason why i never will want to see (or trust) an australian made film again. i have to write more so i will again say that the actors were so bad that i'm positive i could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of trojans. please don't see this movie for your own sake.

i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got. the acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. it took a lot of something i don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. an example of the acting is when paxton's character, vann, is upset the south vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the "sand map". it was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic. to make things worse, i have no idea how i'm supposed to feel about vann. he's obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to vietnam he starts an affair with an vietnamese english teacher. the only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasn't particularly boring. i give it 4 stars out of 10.

shame to see an interesting story diluted into standard "vietnam made for tv" fare. usually hbo movies are a substantial cut above tv. bill paxton was a pretty good choice for the lead role, but wasn't given much to work with.

mild spoilers below.the prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when tfw was filmed. from the opening scene of european refugees to the final prediction that naziism will be the death of millions of germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after pearl harbor. there isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. the rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the herr docktor coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into america with wayne's help. other than the dust bowl scenes, the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight. coburn's speech comparing naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and varno's dr. scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant nazis justifying their actions.when viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of tfw are interesting. if you look at it for entertainment outside of the wwii perspective, you'd have to say this is one of wayne's less successful efforts.

a cbs radio program entitled "we the people" assists in finding an american home for vienna refugee charles coburn (as karl braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. he arrives with beautiful daughter sigrid gurie (as leni), who is "studying" to become a nurse. relocated to a small, dusty midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly john wayne (as john phillips) and his uncle spencer charters (as 'nunk' atterbury), a veterinarian. ms. gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. immediately. but, the prospect of romance with mr. wayne might change her mind...god answers the citizens' many prayers for rain, but it may not be enough to save the farming town. the entire town is advised to relocate to oregon. wayne wants to stay and tough it out. coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic. and, gurie learns her fiancé, presumed dead, will be arriving to claim her as his wife. she feels duty-bound to accept; but, he has a dark secret... this film does not flatter wayne, who seems way out of his element. being paired with gurie, promoted as another garbo, doesn't help. they do have a cute scene in wayne's car ("jalopy, an italian car").**** three faces west (7/3/40) bernard vorhaus ~ john wayne, sigrid gurie, charles coburn, spencer charters

tony curtis and skip homier both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up. must have been too hard on the young stars feet.if the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots. in the first scenes they took off their leggin's just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer. when they went to the area where they dug the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots, then later when lovejoy and curtis run into the framer and his daughter tony is wearing the "tennis shoes " but hey have been blacken. the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest??

this movie is very violent, yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters. it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder. this is where the killings start. from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper. this movie also co-stars richard roundtree.i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good. i would not recommend this film and the action is very, very bad.

essentially plotless action film has two good guys (fong and roundtree) pitted against two bad guys (mitchell and pierce). fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s, roundtree's small part is a far cry from his "shaft" days, and cameron mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in "the toolbox murders" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet). only stack pierce acts with some dignity. as for the violence, don't worry: most of it is too badly done to offend anyone. (*1/2)

i had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory, non stop action, great movie..these people were obviously watching a different movie. killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! i kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but i can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this, i mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny!! i guess the best way to sum this up is it probably should've been rated pg by 1984 standards and now in the year 2010 there is no doubt this would be pg!! bad, bad not in the fun cheesy "b" variety movie!!

one of the worst movies i've ever seen!!! absolutely awful. poor acting, poor story, there isn't one redeeming quality about this movie to recommend. amistad is much better. avoid this movie like the plague!

one of the worst movies i've seen this year. everything about the film screams "amateur". for a movie set in the 1800's, everybody speaks like it's the 1990's. the acting, particularly the people playing the white slave masters, is horrible. after about an hour into this movie, i walked out. what a waste of time and effort. for a much better film on this subject, see steven spielberg's far superior "amistad."

this movie was in one word. terrible. first of all the people who invented that thingie that puts you in the tv, are slightly insane! secondly, the three teens are so obsessed with the show, it's scary! the movie was stupid, and no effort or thought was put into it!

1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10(dir-brett thompson): silly, juvenile-focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment. the script left much to be desired in this hanna-barbara like rip-off of some saturday morning 'live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around. nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either. i'm just amazed i found this at a blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old vhs movies. i guess they couldn't even sell it, so back on the rental rack it went.

adventures in dinosaur city, though a creative idea, was a nauseatingly atrocious attempt at filmmaking. being sucked into a tv and into a new world is interesting. three teens obsessively enthralled with half-animated dinosaurs is not. don't waste the time or the brain power to see this sure loser. i wouldn't even let my kids watch it.

this may be all you need to know in order to decide whether you want to see this.the movie is bad. really, really bad. and sometimes it seems to be aware of that and make fun of how bad it is. it aligns cliche after cliche and even manages to grow worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously funny.if you can laugh about really poor quality in script writing and production values, you might enjoy it. otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage.3/10

okay,i had watched this movie when i was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet i see this!i thought,"i have no idea of what this movie was like,"so i went ahead and put it in.oh my god!!!!!this film is so darn bad!i never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but i did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!!so much stuff in this movie was funny,because it was so stupid!!!!this film is not anywhere near good.i would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it,trust me,i feel your pain as well!!!!

if you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall film making as me and my friends, you need to rent this.from simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content through out. its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen tv to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends. not to mention a hilariously serious scene where t-rex becomes a father figure for one of the kids. yeah...it should be in the comedy section but you'll find it with kid movies if you find it at all. so call your friends over, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh, and enjoy. you will be quoting the laughably horrific one liners in this movie for weeks. "whats with all the ruckus?!"

saw this at the video store and thought i'd give it a try. sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. that was it. the characters looked good, and the actor who played "noel", was the most convincing, though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie. i find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. as the movie went along i kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. asthetically, it was good. the sound and lighting was good, but the acting in this film killed it for me. it was like watching a low grade soap opera. i just kept saying, "i can't believe they released this move like this". i paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad. there's so much i want to say but i'll just say this, everything else, for the most part, was good, it was the acting, as a final cut, that really did this film in.

i'm sorry, but i cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought "ethan mao" was. i have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! warning: i am going to give away a key element to the "plot". after holding his family hostage overnight, ethan lets his vile, evil, hated step-mom go to the bank - alone!!! - to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants. guess what? she calls the cops! wow ... what a twist! i couldn't see that coming at all.the only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes.pure, unadulterated rubbish!

i'm very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. while it had some good features, for the most part i found this movie to be heavy handed, predictable, and, worst of all, not in the least bit scary. the first 30 minutes of the movie were promising, the actress did a nice job in her portrayal, and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. unfortunately, from there, the movie entered into a downward spiral. i went into this movie with no clue as to what it would be about-- didn't know anything about the actors, directors, genre, etc. at a certain point, my wife made the comment "is this supposed to be a scary movie?". well i suppose so, as the boiler-plate "horror movie" score full of squeaking violins and extended vibrato could mean nothing else. there didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the second half of the movie descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous. a movie like this walks a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path, or to jump off and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. for the final 30 minutes, i chose the latter.

this was the first feature film for just about everyone involved, including director teck tan, so they deserve credit for pulling it off. but this film was awkward in its direction, preachy in its style, exaggerated in its acting, and overly politically correct. the plot was all over the place, preventing any aspect of it from developing well. gangsters get involved in the story, though i'm not sure what their presence added to the movie other than making the film even more unrealistic. they could have been completely left out and the film would have been better as a result.the plot is about a young ethnic chinese malaysian who returns to his home country after studying in the west. his studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of malaysian charts (a rather juvenile premise). the beginning of the film hints at conflict with his traditional father, but once the gangsters get involved this part of the story is dropped unceremoniously.the film tries to take advantage of malaysia's wondrously diverse ethnic mix, but unfortunately the manner in which these aspects were put to film either seemed terribly contrived or downright preachy. there is a pretty scene of malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural.the acting came off as somewhat amateurish, and the male lead was particularly unconvincing. the female malay lead was a notable exception leaving the most positive mark. the film also has an openly gay character, and though he is a bit of a caricature, he provides some of the funnier moments in the film. but the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television soap drama. sadly, this film, which is not in the least offensive, has been banned in malaysia. 3/10

to call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement.the acting was unconvincing to say the least, especially from actor craig fong, who couldn't have acted stiffer. as far as story goes...well...what story?! the "film" is nominally about harry lee, a malaysian of chinese descent who comes back to his home country after flunking out of every course he took and tries to start a band.the film has ever cliche you can think of -- sex, tension among band members and a little bit of racial tension thrown in.the problem is that even with a subject that's been covered adequately by even the most amateurish directors, this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels contrived with parts that would make even the most hardened reviewers' hairs stand on end.

oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. if you can even call it a film. this looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.the "talents" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.the film in no way reflects malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. i live in malaysia, btw.spinning gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. and unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked. some reviewers would no doubt describe it as "exotic", but a more accurate word would be "atrocious".

yep. those of my generation who grew up watching those old sunbow cartoons were spoiled. the 80's joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. well written stories, well developed characters. granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. fast forward almost twenty years later and enter valor vs. venom. the animation was average at most. the movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. the movie felt more like a small soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force. then we have character development or lack there of. dusty likes to be all dusty? slice and dice like to do things together? what? did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of jar jar binks? as for the story. i like a bit of sci-fi. but that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the joe universe. mega monsters or toxo-zombies anyone? but i give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes. i'm not a huge fan of se and ss but i did like the fight scenes between the two. if you can appreciate vvv for what it is you will enjoy it. i admit to not being able to appreciate vvv as i should. again everything joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's, and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of gi joe. if you can appreciate vvv for what it is you will enjoy it.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. unless you're into masochism, never see it. it was an insufferably long, pointless, eye-harming, depressing movie and will forever top my list of bad movies. whoever wrote this movie is a sadist. i almost cried at the end, that's how bad it was. i'd like to give it zero stars, but since that's not an option, i give it one.

11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on imdb. there is a reason for this utter lack of interest in across the moon. it is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. see this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. the opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. the ending features michael mckean staring out a prison window saying "there's lots of mysteries out there." followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. julinana hatfield. everything in between is awful. i struggled to find any value in this movie and have come up empty. though it is hard to believe, even a cameo role from burgess meridith (always a crowd pleaser) only disappointed me further. this movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies. on paper the movie is below average. women living together in a trailer. but what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable. the movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any. the unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved. no conflict is ever resolved. there really is no conflict. the women attempt to become hookers, but that never happens. instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf stocker. sound exciting? it wasn't. it was stupid. and the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and generating contrived conflict. the women are capable actresses, but the script was beyond poor. useless. this was a terrible movie, but it is even worst that they borough burgess meridith out of his retirement home to make it. bad from start to finish. like the lion without teeth, this film has no bite.

the movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. clayburgh's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to rome and sing as a diva. matthew objects but comes along. he connects with the young girl again but this time, matt is on cocaine. his superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. she doesn't know how to handle matt's addiction. the movie drags on in search of a plot. clayburgh is in the wrong role and bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture. the moon has great symbolism.save your time. i am perhaps overly generous with 4*.

for the first forty minutes or so, luna is a real pleasure to watch. the characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and locations are beautiful to look at. then jill clayburgh discovers her son matthew barry is using heroin and the movie starts to unravel and then becomes outright laughable in its sickness.clayburgh asks him why and when he started using the drug and she nor the audience ever get a straight answer, which would be a bit helpful. he mentions not caring about anything but that's not right because we see clearly in the amazing early scenes that he has a good deal of interest in his mother's singing, baseball, sex, and apparently cared enough to turn down marijuana. this movie is for people who think junior gets into hard drugs because mom and dad were workaholics who missed his piano recital. i think such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug like heroin was chosen as some sort of intellectual catalyst for the later scenes of incest. there's a lot of discussion about the mother's love for the son but it's really about bernardo bertolucci being pretentious. luna would have been great as a quaint little family drama.how old was matthew barry in this movie? i was more concerned over the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this film than for anything his character was going through. ** out of ****

a friend and i went to see this movie. we have opposite opinions about fujimori but after watching this movie we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened, no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film. if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history, watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble. and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really abusing their power. to make it even worse, the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with fujimori's regime. she decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to peruvians. but this is not surprising because, both, the director and the cia are violating the sovereignty of peru by trying to affect the democratic processes at very different levels of course.if the director was really interested in helping peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary. in any case there are numerous peruvian made documentaries, films and books about the subject. such include "ojos que no ven", "dias de santiago", "montesinos-fujimori: las dos caras de la misma moneda", "montesinos: poderoso caballero", etc. the director of the "fall of fujimori" should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations.

i was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as frontline or "fog of war" (by errol morris). instead i was appalled by this shallow and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: alberto fujimori. this movie should be called "the return of fujimori". the director presumes she made a "perfect" movie because alienates both pro and anti-fujimori factions when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional piece of work. the movie has few crucial facts wrong: 1) she uses the so called "landslide" election of 1995 in which fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote, as an example of the massive popular support of fujimori. but we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud.2) the movie states that sendero luminoso (shining path) killed 60,000 people. in fact, the truth commission's final report states that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in peru. 33% of those were caused by sl. that leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, military and other groups. the fact that she uses the same misleading information that fujimori has been using for 10 years it is another example of how terrible this movie is. for any person with some education on peruvian politics and history, fujimori is clearly a consummated manipulator, a delusional character and remorseless egomaniac. his regime was very far from being democratic. he is still a menace to peruvians. despite these facts the director lets fujimori tell the story. not only on how he wants the camera to be positioned but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. he always seems to have the last word. there are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and unchallenged remarks. where is oriana fallaci when we need her? the director, when questioned after the screening, didn't hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by fujimori, his charm and intelligence. yes, she has been definitely charmed by him, and you can tell by looking at this film. it's obvious she has a very hard time to digest the multitude of facts that point towards his responsibility on the corruption, murder and deception that took place. she assured the gasping audience that fujimori was really a "patriot" when few moments earlier, one of the leading peruvian journalists was very adamant in telling us that fujimori was, above all, a "traitor". she went on to say that despite all the accusations not "a single dollar" was found on any bank account on his name, etc, etc. it was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs that ruled the country for 10 years defending their master. it was a sad moment for journalism.this film makes injustice to history. it is an insult to hundreds of dead people, disappeared or unjustly incarcerated by fujimori's regime. no wonder she later confessed that all the peruvian intellectuals she befriended while making the movie felt betrayed by it. unbiased? the words "oportunistic", "naïve" and "denial" come to my mind instead.

all the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced. that is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. but a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. the director herself admitted to this at the first san francisco film festival showing. she justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to fujimori. that might be true but by showing so much of fujimori's take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro-fujimori and unbalanced. i dare any of the other commentators to prove this wrong tips 1: claiming harvard professors, intellectuals, and latin american diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). tip 2: disagreeing with the director doesn't help your argument either (the director says she thinks fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore she portrayed him that way)

not a balanced point of view. the director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. the movie has some criticism of fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. so few critics of fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. but that is not the case.the movie barely shows one of the massacres that fujimori is accused of. and it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the mrta insurgents that took the japanese embassy. it is well documented that the cia did the planning. there is even pictures of a well known cia strategist on the site published by caretas magazine and other newspapers.the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions: the director is pro-fujimori and purposely and falsely chooses to give the credit to him; the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and fujimori worked together; or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not peruvian and was not present in peru at the time the events occurred.the explanation provided by other commentators, that fujimori is still fairly popular in peru, does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations.also, the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of fujimori were the highest i have ever heard of. most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower.another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of sendero and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by ketin vidal and he had complete autonomy from fujimori and montesinos.the first government of fujimori did experience an improvement in overall economic trends (gdp) but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial for the country in the long term. also, the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during fujimori's regime. in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and by the end of fujimori's second term the economy was about to collapse.in terms of investments in infrastructure of fujimori's regime, they fallow the paternalistic pattern. they were created to raise support for fujimori but were not meant to last long. these structures needed continued maintenance but fujimori did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment. in fact, fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizing such as unions and grass-roots groups and the increase in informal unorganized labor was immense.finally, the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favour of fujimori (the media, business owners, the military, etc) that were so wide spread it was impossible that fujimori was not aware of it.

i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seen.completely unfunny, low budget, boring, rubbish script, terrible acting - the entire audience (young and old) sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it... there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire moviemany people left halfway - can't blame them... i stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and i wish i'd left. the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen. i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all - it just wasn't funny. the people who made this movie really don't deserve your money, so please don't pay to see this film.this isn't even funny enough to be shown on tv, let alone cinema...i wanted to give it 0 out of 10, but the system won't allow it...

rabbit fever is one of those film oddities. it's an enjoyable 90 minutes, demands little of the viewer, and delivers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received. which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator. the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product. the narrative is 100% tongue in cheek throughout.the storyline is strong, an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters, some enjoyable back-story, peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story, and pleasing conclusions. sadly there's nothing that feels clever or new. rabbit fever has some sharp moments, a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of, and all credit to them it's not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo, i could probably watch it with my mother. but there's a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back, those moments went you are up for it, when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a dollop of sit-com.i chuckled, i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters, but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv, light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema. i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do, it's a quirky subject, a rounded storyline, a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. but there's nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment. quite the opposite - a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack.

rabbit fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of sex and the city (the latter half of 1998, rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women). from opening statistics that make rabbit fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to solitary pleasure.men, as germaine greer rather arrogantly explains, have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. the rabbit vibrator (which some statistics suggest accounts for about a quarter of all vibrator sales) is so called because of little rabbit-like long ears which vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while rotating pearls inside the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina. the film interviews characters that attend rabbits anonymous to help overcome their 'addiction', as well as known people such as tom conti posing as a professor or richard branson (amid scenes of rabbits being banned on aircraft) saying he would like to provide free rabbits to his first class air travel passengers and ultimately to all of them.the main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of cinema, the sketches don't have the writing skills of say a charlotte church or ricky gervais to make them funny enough and, while it might make desultory late night tv, doesn't have a hook to get people to queue up in public at multiplexes to watch masturbation jokes.lines like, "it's been nearly a week since you used your rabbit - how are you coping?" wear rather thin after five minutes. the film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word 'rabbit' will get a laugh . . . and another one, and another one. frantic midnight drives to buy batteries might be amusing in real life, but here they look rather laborious, and the special emergency delivery service outstays its welcome.strangely the bbfc gave it an 18 certificate in spite of zero violence, hardly any explicit sex, and sexual references that are less 'perverted' than any late night comedy show. the company protested the decision, but the bbfc didn't budge. at first sight this seems overkill on their part and their consumer advice now simply says, "contains frequent strong sex references." one might think that youngsters would find masturbation jokes funnier than the most desperate of hen night parties, and the topic one worthy of debate; but rabbit fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to its subject matter.the best part is probably the rabbit song by ruocco (who play a band called thumper in the film). for those who have dozed off and woken up at the end credits, there is a bonus scene at the end of them to reassure them that they haven't missed anything.

gotta add a comment to this one!!!first, ironically, one needs to add the "spolier alert" to conform to imdb's parameters, but there is absolutely nothing here to be "spoiled."there are six characters: the good-looking gal whose the a-list mountain guide in the area of the "climb," and apparently among all guides (including mt. everest sherpas) on the planet; her lost love, who disappeared from the titled pass two years prior, whom the party is purportedly seeking, but never find; her store-owner friend, also a guide, who may be better than a sherpa but no match for her; the weird lead actor who engages her services, and says they'll find her long-missing love in the bargain; his one associate, a computer hacker with purportedly limitless expertise, of a level sufficient that gates might seek advice from him; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who apparently has an iq not even near three digits.there are, of course, nefarious goings-on, and the secret quest of the lead actor is to gain recovery of a satellite which has fallen in the "pass," and has world-altering and unique data to bring them untold riches. exactly what is never revealed.overacting abounds, the script looks like something which might get a c- in a freshman writing class (but an f if submitted at a higher level), and the thespians gnaw every piece of scenery like a horde of beavers.the most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposing portions with three other flicks or roles i've seen.first, the mysterious, undisclosed secret data makes one recall "the spanish prisoner," an a-list/mamet film, surrounding a valuable corporate "process," never specifically clarified, but better for it. definitely not so here.second, the lead biscuit proved perhaps even more resourceful then "rambo" in dealing quickly when menaced later in the presentation.third, i remember a steven seagal flick (don't recall the title) where he was semi-conscious and abed for about 1/3 of the time, and fully-comatose for another 1/3. although i've not sought viewing a lot of his work, i've seen enough to have noted that while comatose, he provided the best work he ever has, and most in-line with his laconic persona. in this opus, while awake, the young hacker may have been the most engaging personality on-screen, but while indisposed and incapacitated during the latter portion, and unable to emote, he provided the best acting during this seemingly unending two hours.take the thin, silly basis for a plot here. imagine it being compressed into, say, a lbit on snl, with gilda radner, bill murray, dan aykroyd and martin short in the four roles. they could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog here.the most interesting aspect in the last analysis is contemplating what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth "even billions" to any of many nations, and yet rendered worthless (according to the guru hacker) if simply placed upon the internet, with no apparent consequences thereafter? even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere. this one is totally devoid.

spoiler alert.this movie will spoil your afternoon or "wee small hours of the morning" viewing slot.i like marc singer. he has portrayed good characters in the roles i have seen. until this movie.what starts as a promising movie soon disappears up itself with the disastrous cgi'd background and the extreme close up on the person about to die...then it gets worse.a lot worse.to describe it as hammy acting would insult pigs. this movie goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and scrapes the acting off there.apart from marc singer's overcooked hamming it up, mike dopud stomps and plods around the scenery looking as if he is afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide-eyed 'manic' bad guy just makes him look like a moron. he isn't menacing at all.george stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. he claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character would have been threatened by a cashier offering him "paper or plastic".this is really a vehicle for nicole eggert as an independent woman getting her life back despite attracting the wrong sort of man... she was unremarkable.this is not a remake but this is remarkably similar to "cliffhanger" - seasoned guide, loses someone in a fall, conscience pricked to help out someone else, a missing treasure worth oodles of money and a gang of n'er-do-wells who exploit the guide. except cliffhanger was a great vehicle for stallone and lithgow. i must admit, lithgow stole the show.even the unintentional comedy was poor. there were times when i wasn't sure if they were using a rubber-faced model as a stand-in for singer as he tried in vain to storm the weather station (no pun intended). pressing his face to the door post and his clumsy manner in general did nothing to help his character.avoid.no, seriously, avoid it. save 96 minutes of your life and do something else more constructive like watching paint dry or grass grow. or just close your eyes and examine the backs of your eyelids for 90 minutes...

i saw this on a boring sunday morning just this morning. well i was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie.. i was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited.. they just go back and forth in the same spot all over again.. i hate it when they're using this so called hi-tech stuffs like the this motorola blue-tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny.. they look like amateurs. and they where like advertising those badly designed alien-ware laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people.. i couldn't say more about this tv-movie.. the ending was bad that it looks like they cut it short eliminating the use of rescue helicopters and etc.. */**********

i caught this film -- under the title of "what lies above" -- on lifetime movie network last night, and just had to comment on it. designed as a resourceful-woman-in-peril, action adventure yarn, it is so unintentionally funny (thanks in large part to marc singer's scenery-chewing hammy performance)that i thought i was watching a cross between "cliffhanger" and "home alone 5." heroine nicole eggert makes her devious but dumb as dirt male pursuers look like the three stooges succumbing to her ridiculous makeshift booby traps (somehow she manages to devise a swinging battering ram with rope and a log in a matter of minutes, which temporarily takes out one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her). worth watching for a hearty laugh.

so i caught this one afternoon as "what lies above" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. the heroine, diana pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé brian gets hurt on a climb. when she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.two years later, diana is still a climber...but she won't go near snowman's pass. that is, until curt seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program. she agrees and they take off up the mountain with curt's two assistants: his "bodyguard" hugo and the computer whiz tyler. from the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.the major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition. the object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how snowman's pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie. but what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. the majority of the movie revolves around the search for brian, that's why i can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie. this was the major plot. this was how the movie started! how do you not wrap that up?i wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...

the limited scenery views were the only saving grace to an otherwise uneventful and boring movie. the acting was borderline absurd which i blame on the script and screenplay. nicole eggert didn't look the part, didn't act the part, and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide. after watching this i was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie. it must have been produced on a budget of pocket change. the plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of acting at times it begged the question to be asked, "why are we doing this?". i managed to sit through the entire movie but also asked myself, "why?".

somehow, i really thought that i was going to enjoy this film because i love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot. i must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention. i thought that nicole eggert,(diana pennington),"thank you, good night",'01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain. marc singer, "angel blade",'02, played a very unconvincing weird guy and over acted in many scenes with a bad temper that looked comical. this film was a big disappointed and not worth watching, unless there is nothing on the tv to enjoy!!

eight legged freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'attack of the giant [insert animal here]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. so, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like gremlins, jurassic park, starship troopers and flavor it with some parody like scary movie. gremlins is probably the best comparison, but eight legged freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like scary movie. it was way too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes.for a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting, and that is just the way it was. the story though was extremely thin, with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes, leading up to an easily spotted and corny ending.i rate eight legged freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious.

i'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. i'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is. i'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie, because i'll be here for ages if i do. the storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. this is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (as most of us here are) little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience. if your a casual movie watcher, who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick, then this movie is perfect for you, lots of fun. it would also be a good movie to take a partner to. just not for us movie buff's. 5 out of 10

movie title - tartdate of review - 5/26/02year of movie - 2001stars - dominique swain, brad renfro, bijou phillips (barely), melanie griffith (barely)necro's rating - 4 skulls out of 10may contain spoilersplotan "outcast" dominique swain wants to be with the "in" group and so she abandons her real friends and joins them.......much annoying rich people talk occurs. actingugh, i guess i got what i wanted in that dominique was ok, but man, the rest of the cast besides maybe brad renfro were bad or at least not interesting or likable at all. i know some could say that the others were good because they made me hate them....trust me....i like unlikable chars but this group is unlikable because they can't convincingly be bad people.it figures that the only other people i got this for were barely even in it and that is melanie griffith and bijou phillips, but the little time they had they were ok. melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least bijou had a good character although small.violence and goremy mind was constantly under attack from horrid dialogue and very very annoying characters, that's violence enough!! ok there was one bludgeoning with a rock which was ok.t&a nudity factorhahaha, they couldn't even add in any nudity to help spice up this movie, probably because no one would want to bear their body for this crap. if they are going to expose themselves they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for "oh hey i heard she gets naked in this one."overall view of the movie (review)ok ok i know i pride myself on being the person who can like most if not almost all movies or at least find some good in it. well this movie is one of the few i really struggled to find anything worth while in. the problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying. i already have a deep hatred for snobby rich people attitudes and that didn't help either. all this movie really is, is just a bunch of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid. i can't stress the annoyance factor enough. this movie tries to rehash the tried and true "in group" plotline which can usually be done ok with little difficulty.why do i not have a pic from the movie or the box cover? well i felt this movie didn't deserve that glory so i decided to put a pic of the reason i rented this, and that reason is none other than dominique swain. yes i too was wooed by her in lolita and thought she was so good that i decided from then on to check her out in any movie in which she acts. at least i keep my promises and yes i have seen the majority of her movies, minus a few hard to find ones. she herself is a great actress and i would defend her actively, but man she chooses some of the crappiest movies to star in. this movie and smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness, but at least smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some real good scenes.also the dvd box tries to fool you into thinking that this movie has stars as well in it by putting melanie griffith and bijou phillips names on the front of the box. if there's one thing that p****s me off it's a movie that plasters the names of stars on a box to make you think "wow it has ____ i wonder how good ___is in this one i saw ___ in that movie and thought she was great!" only to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2. bijou actually had a part that semi-meant something. melanie on the other hand, only has 2 lines about.... granted i don't like melanie that much, but this is about ethics and not star acting.out of all this mess though props must go to brad renfro for turning in an ok performance along with dominique. brad may be one very messed up kid in real life, but at least he can act. so the only reason this movie gets any skulls is because i got what i basically wanted which was dominique swain and brad renfro. also i had the added pleasure of seeing underrated actress bijou phillips make me like her even more. so even though i was annoyed throughout i still came out with some positives, although this was pretty hard this time.i recommend you to only see this if you've seen lolita and know how good dominique is or if you are some offbeat fan of brad or bijou. uber melanie fans will be sorely depressed. also if you're a fan of crappy movies like me, please do not assume this be a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty alright, for the money spent on buying or renting.some movies are "so bad that they are good" as the saying goes. what they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (to pass up)."necro

tart is the worst movie i've seen this year, and that includes both the affleck/j.lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses. i don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 corpses. regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction.*** spoilers *** (although i honestly don't think there's anything to spoil)tart is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids. most of them reside in super-sized apartments along new york's hyper-expensive park avenue, thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents. the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students (cat) as she discards her only true friend (as frivolous a person as she was) in the pursuit of the "good life" with the in-crowd. that, of course, leads to sex, drugs, and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll. everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are. cat's first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose. no heavy-handed messages there, he said sarcastically.that's mainly what the "seen it before 100 times" plot entails. other minor, and even less interesting, plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others, a wild child who lives life on the edge (and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons), an anti-semitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father, and cat's strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has. the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife. the "wild child" is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters. the british girl disappears from the film after the break-up. the mother/daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film's final schmaltzy scene, where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts. *yawn**** end spoilers ***about the cast and crew.... dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly watchable lolita and face/off. her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few "ones-to-watch" lists at the time. she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career. if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart, it very well may be.i've only seen bijou phillips in one other film (bully) and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here. i'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar. my guess is that the former is true. i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned. here, she is the actress tapped to portray the watered-down hilton sister. that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with, and remains friends with, the real-life hilton sisters. she's essentially playing a version of herself in this film, and doing a damn poor job of it.as for writer/director christina wayne... i know nothing of her other than tart was her first, and only, film project to date. with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short-lived.

an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake. let's see. where do we begin. she is a traitor during a world war; she redeems that by falling in love; her friends (who are presumably patriots because they are german citizens) are expendable and must die; and she winds up as a heroine. ok. the scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for french intelligence can't even be described, and we won't even mention rock's romantic scenes with a female. (by the way, when they visit a museum, look at his gaze - i reran it on video and it's priceless). is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? i don't know and you won't either.

i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad, it's 4:3 aspect ratio film, and it just keeps getting worse, the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable, i was like watching the movie and said to myself: this going to happen next and guess what happened? right...if you want to see a good action boxing movie, don't watch this one you'll end disappointed on this low-budget movie like i did. go and see ali its way better!

it's about time for a female boxing flick, but this one ain't it. though the acting isn't too bad, the predictable storyline and silly dialogue pretty much ruin this one from the get go. to top it off, the boxing scenes display zero tension. come on! how hard is it to make a boxing match seem exciting??!!

well, i fell for it. i saw the box for this at the video store, and mistook it for "girlfight", which i'd heard was great. in my own defense, the titles are similar, and they re-did the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical. anyway, to sum it up, they obviously re-did the whole cover packaging/promo to capitalize on the buzz/success of "girlfight". i popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straight-to-video flicks, and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie, which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature. when i saw the first few minutes and maria conchita alonso showed up, i knew i'd fallen for it. (don't get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but i knew she wasn't in "girlfight", the movie i'd been under the false impression i was renting).so, apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer, the movie was ok. the plot involves belle, a young latino woman who is the daughter of an ex-champion boxer. one of her close friends is a female boxer, who--and i could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a drag--gets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named "the terminator", who resembles a female version of a bigger, more pumped up ike turner. of course, belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. she lives with her caring, supportive yet protective dad (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who just happens to be a cop. her love interest, also caring and supportive yet protective, is also a cop who works with her dad. hmmm, they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty...wonder what's gonna happen? she starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course, pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her. the actor they hired looks like a very low-rent cary eweles and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache. his acting was also really, really bad. i'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen rocky, or almost anyone, knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end.this was not a completely terrible movie. most of the acting was ok, and the lead actress was very good. there were good, strong female latino role models. the final fight scene did get me sort of interested, even though i knew everything that was going to happen long before it did. the actress that played "the terminator" did a great job of being unlikeable enough that i really did want belle to kick her a$$, and rooted for belle-again, although there were absolutely no surprises. my favorite moment (maybe the only moment where i wasn't mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake) was when belle slaps her sleazy manager after he's shown his true colors, yells at him, and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear, showing that she is really the one in charge.the dialogue was really, really bad, my main complaint. one of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying "size doesn't matter" and the female replying wryly, "now where have i heard that before?" other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are "the doctors told me i may never walk again!" "come on, you know you can trust me!" and "your mother would have been so proud of you". i could go on and on. nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or movies-of-the-week. maybe i'm being too mean-the filmmakers did make an effort, and i did sit through the whole thing voluntarily...but only because there was nothing else to watch while i worked out. you could do worse (especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters) but you could also do much, much better.

this is, in simple terms, one of the worst films ever made. the story goes way beyond being tasteless and judging by the actors performance, they know it. there just in not one single redemming quality of this film. patrick swayze will have to overcome some major obstacles in his career, before people forget about this turkey.

updating of the clare booth luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment. the cast of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together. there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common, but at the same time its just as timely as ever, i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot. wait for cable.

no! no - no - no! my entire being is revolting against this dreadful remake of a classic movie. i knew we were heading for trouble from the moment meg ryan appeared on screen with her ridiculous hair and clothing - literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging. meg ryan playing meg ryan - how tiresome is that?! and it got worse ... so much worse. the horribly cliché lines, the stock characters, the increasing sense i was watching a spin-off of "the first wives club" and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room. how many times have i seen this movie? only once, but it feel like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh about it. for shame!

saw this movie last night. i don't usually comment good or bad, as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. this movie was bad. by the end i thought, oh my, this is testing my patience. how many women really look and live like this when they hit "rock bottom" and if i could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams - gosh, life would be great! i was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my darling hubby likes watching movies together and i knew this wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but this was one bad movie. we are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasn't that. annette benning is a great actress, she held her own. bad. bad.

it doesn't take balls to make-fun of retarded people. having to listen to mencia insist that he is brave to make "retard" jokes is intolerable. also, it doesn't take balls to bite off of the chapelle show. the racial game-shows, the racial olympics, it seems like a lot of the skits are merely reworked chapelle show skits, that are just way less funny. but the most irksome thing in the show is his insistence that he is just marching to the beat of his own drum, when he is actually marching to the beat of many over-worked, over-done drums that have been drummed many times.i hate this show. i hate that it presents itself as a voice for latin america.and no carlos, i am not trying to censore you. if people like it, then keep it on. but i personally think that it's a bad show.

carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action, racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas. he's there because of his race and then denigrates it. he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican, and i would also contend he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell he's not the sharpest tool....though he is definitely a tool of some sort. he is a hack comedian who, even with a staff of writers, can't put together 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show. i can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy (not too surprisingly, he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubt.if you ever see the greats, jerry seinfeld, chris rock, jon stewart etc. talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice. all that work was completely skipped by mencia; his comedic voice is, in part, stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe. mencia's show is beloved by some of the "at least i don't suck that badly crowd" who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society; unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic.

i've only seen most of the series since i leave the tv on as background noise in my dorm.i've been a fan of mencia but this show really doesn't do much for me. occasionally he'll say or do something to pull a chuckle out, but he has this aura of smugness that completely ruins it.i've always thought he was funny because of his raging angry-man routine that's not terribly prevalent in this tv series. instead, he's just smug. i guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when he isn't in the proper mode of delivery. i've seen him get into it sometimes on his show, but for the most part, he just sits there smiling and looking smug, and it doesn't suit him well.just my opinion though.

carlos is perhaps not the most original comic, but the first series was amusing, his forthright comments and observations were fresh. i missed a couple of seasons, but after all of the allegations of stealing material i caught a couple of episodes of the mind of mencia at the end of july 07. a bit of a change i see! carlos is much more into toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations. in one episode he sort of implied he was in the same league as chris rock and dave chappelle. i think not. perhaps comedy central will give him one more season, but episodes i saw sounded tired and samey with more words beeped out than the osbournes. carlos, go back to stand-up for a couple of years, get some fresh material and try again.

occasionally i accidentally leave the television on after "south park" and i end up catching some of the train wreck of middle school humor that is "mind of mencia". it's the only time i wish my room was cleaner because i'd be able to find the remote that much faster. the truth is comedy central was in need of a replacement "chappelle's show", and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss dave so much they'll cling to any minority variety show, or are satisfied with the plain "mexicans love tacos" jokes that carlos mencia shovels in every week. i am to understand, though, that there are some people out there that actually find mencia *shudder* funny. i firmly stand by my words when i say i believe these people to exist only in myth. however, if you are indeed out there, i ask only that you never enter into my housing district, and read these major differences between carlos and "chappelle's show": 1) dave was funny. you may want to highlight this one. 2) "chappelle's show" was five times as edgy as mencia could ever hope to be. yet every time a promo for his little show airs, it's all about him, tooting his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before. you've got that right, carlos. and not in a good way. chappelle didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny. we all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselves.3) chappelle actually had race jokes that dove into some depth of the different cultures- things that some people didn't know about. like his "i know black people" game segment. the grand prize was some hair cream that black people use. that's deeper than mencia would ever dare to dive. so how dare he call himself edgy? if mencia were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid. and my accusations have some merit. i saw a promo for his show (which i have affectionately come to call 'my t.v. monitor taking a s--t for thirty minutes') a few days ago and it was some stereotype olympics sketch, which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept. then i saw that the mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize. that's it?! that's as close to the fire as you wanna get? who couldn't think of that- back in 7th grade? for you fans of the show, if you're ever watching and you miss one of his punchlines- perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how "duh-de-durr" never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say- just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway: green card, tacos, border jumpers, lawn mowers, and of course, duh-de-dur. just remember-whichever it was, it was screamed. enjoy!4) kind of relating to number two. every time he says something that gets a laugh, he'll pause to tell people (while laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with that last one". then don't say it for god's sake. or let the people decide by themselves. he and comedy central keep shoving this tripe down my throat that he's this tell-it-like-it-is show that is more controversial than "the da vinci code". you're not. you never will be. i've never been offended by the show's content. i would never give it that much credit. i'm offended that carlos mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. yeah... i'm literally offended by that fact.

carlos mencia is not funny. from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series, carlos mencia is not funny. i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians' jokes, and as far as his comedy material goes, he is a regular "johnny-come-lately" with far less than sub-par results. psycho astronaut jokes? britney spears breakdown jokes? i hope this is only a scheduling error, but come on carlos and comedy central, those topics, and many others, have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts' opening monologues, saturday night live, mad tv and many, many others. lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes? comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around. perhaps people, especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this week's issue of "new york" magazine accurately labeled him: "carlos mencia, unrepentant joke-filcher."

i'm a huge comedy show fan. racial humor is always a little risky but the greats like george lopez, dave chapelle, lisa lampanelli etc. pull it off perfectly.they don't go overboard, make the audience uncomfortable or *cough cough* steal jokes! but i won't harp upon that.carlos makes racial humor totally unenjoyable. his jokes continually scream racial humor to the point were it's not funny or clever, but it's insulting. i'm not one to turn cold towards racial humor. but his execution of these jokes is sloppy that cause people to recoil at his comedy.his humor is only surpassed by his stage presence in annoyance. i feel as though he's screaming at me constantly! and he runs around the stage like a maniac. it only comes off as annoying!

besides the fact that this guy is a liar, he is also a total idiot, and a thief in the comedy community. once when i attempted to watch this excuse for a television show, i believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little. i can't help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while i am enjoying great comedy central programs like reno 911 and american body shop. it shows like this that make me worry about the continual existence of mankind. it's hard to believe that even joe rogan can make someone look like an moron. please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible. haven't we suffered enough?

okay, i like to give the benefit of the doubt. i watched his show.it isn't funny to me. all i remember was a lot of "weird" noises and yelling. i don't think i even cracked a smile. the only thing that somewhat resembled humour was his anjelina jolie/jennifer aniston bit. i think you can get dumber by the minute watching it though.also, what's with the "ask whitey?" section? is that a ripoff of "ask a gay dude?/black man?" from chappelle's show? isn't it that obvious? but when chappelle did it, he was exposing the ignorance of the subject. like borat. but what's up with picking random white people and yelling stuff at them? that's not funny, its just plain dumb.and i'm pretty sure i heard certain "jokes" of his somewhere else... it seems abit like he's 'plagerising' bits & pieces, throwing in some "loud" yelling.anyway, it wasn't funny. seriously. don't even waste your time.

the tagline for this show is, "he's speaking his mind. we're hiring extra lawyers." if you look back in time, any classic raunchy comedian never prided himself in being controversial. richard pryor's tagline wasn't, "i'm crude, racist and daring." that's basically how comedy central is marketing this show - in your face, non-pc and "honest" - but how can a television show pride itself in being this way? where's the humility and humbleness? and what suddenly has made carlos mencia this huge figure for comedy central? let's start at the beginning - dave chappelle cancels his show (which became unexpectedly popular and controversial) and comedy central is looking around for someone new to push. they hire this guy named ned who claims to be a mexican, even though he isn't. they splatter his face on a few tv ads and make it look like they're being "daring" by unleashing him upon the public.i've seen a lot of hateful topics on the forums for this show, and i don't agree with "mencia's" detractors. this is not an awful show. it had me crying in laughter a few times. when it's funny, it's very, very funny. yes, it's juvenile - but so was chappelle's.the problem with carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over. and he's too obvious. the overt marketing put aside, "carlos" has now said beaner so many times i have lost count. he's trying to make it the next famous line (like "i'm rick james, b****!") but it's way too obvious.in terms of repeating himself, carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over. for example, on one episode he said he'd love it if all mexicans disappeared from america overnight. he'd wake up and an american guy would be saying, "room ser'vuce!" in a southern accent.he used this exact same joke - verbatim - when he appeared as a guest on adam carolla's talk show. it was a great deal less funny the second time around, because he seemed more desperate.is "carlos" funny? i think so. there are some outrageous moments on his show. but he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and letting his comedy naturally progress. repeating silly little catchphrases over and over again coupled with goofy faces and loud vocal screams does indeed get old quite fast...i just hope carlos - or his writers - can give a new edge to this show, because right now it's starting to dwindle in repeat hell.

there's been a whole lot made about carlos mencia's (mr. holness, excuse me) theft of other comics' material. heck, even before joe rogan had a blowup with him on stage i knew that carlos mensteala was swiping material from cosby and kinison and a host of others.to compound the crime of his theft, he retold these comic geniuses jokes badly.and that is a crime he continues to perpetuate on this show. i'm sure the series writers have to share some of the blame - it's got to be hard to write jokes day in and day out... but that's why people get paid so darned much to do it! these series writers need to go back to their day jobs of flipping burgers or whatever it was they were doing before they decided to embark upon a career of intellectual theft.not to say that he steals all of his material. you can tell when he has devised a joke on his own when what you are watching transcends the merely awful and goes straight into the territory of horrifyingly bad.because he likes to call people b***h on his show, ten year olds call him a genius. they're gonna grow up one of these days, carlos, and when they do, you're gonna dry up and blow away.

thats right i can't watch comedy central anymore just because i can't bear to watch the repeated commercials for this show. i'll tell you the truth, this is a terrible show not because i'm offended by it, but because carlos mencia is one of the worst comedians i have ever seen. i rather watch carrot top do a george bush impression than watch this no-skill hack. and to believe he calls himself the greatest. even if he didn't steal the jokes, he is still bad at telling them, he's way off-timing and unoriginal. i remember in one joke he said "why do white people go camping? to pretend there poor for a week?" now what is that suppose to mean? that all white people are rich? another one i didn't understand was when he did a skit of the price is right and he told some fat guy "you should know how much a fridge cost, you're fat" and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face. but what does that mean? that "fat people" are always looking for refrigerators? those are just the two i seen in his commercials, god knows what his show is like..this show falls in the likes of epic movie and date movie..

to put it simply, mind of mencia is the worst, unfunniest show on comedy central, and quite possibly all of television... ever. i love comedy central and watch many shows and movies there all the time, but every time the intro for this show even starts after some good comedy, i can't find the remote fast enough.mencia tells used, worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial, then will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say 'they liked it, so all of your race likes it, and by extension me too'. give me a break mencia, i don't know if those people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes, doesn't mean he thinks you're funny, it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do, smack you on tv? he gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful, and thought provoking, which is apparent in his commercials, but when you actually watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. he also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you don't have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that, maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade carlos. the guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking, but i think you'll find that if anyone was thinking what he says, they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous, and that's why they never said it in the first place.all in all, watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must, because after you've seen 1 episode, you've seen them all. why comedy central keeps renewing this horrible show is well beyond me. if you're looking for good comedy, look elsewhere, because you will find very little of it here.

did you find the title funny? oh, you didn't? well that's because you're uptight. learn to laugh because if you're not laughing, you're not living. so please, lower your standards regarding to what you believe is funny to that of a mere infant. now do you find it funny? still no?! ok, that's because you're full of yourself and get offended too easily. if you're not laughing, you're not living. and if you don't like me then send me hate mail so that i could write another review and state how much hate mail i get and try to twist this into making it seem as if i am a bad ass. are you laughing at my hilarious title yet? still no?!?! ok that's it! you are a racist! you have to laugh or else you are a racist. why else would you not laugh? oh, it's not funny!?! no, this can't be why. i want it to be funny so therefor it is!! laugh damn it!!!! please!!! deedeedee!! durdurdur!! please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok that's it. where's my notepad and pen? and where's my richard pryor dvd's? i need to write some jokes for my show.and...... scene. thank you, thank you.this is basically what you'll get from mencia for about 23 minutes. please, do yourself a favor and change the channel when this bum's show comes on. even basic cable channels have things 100x better than this. i'm not even saying this because i hate him. i'm for real. this show is like watching grass grow. not sure though, at least grass doesn't steal jokes. i'm honestly trying to save your time. i even tried watching his show. i told myself "maybe he isn't that bad.". but no, he is. i completely zone out when i watched his show. i tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show but i couldn't. i zoned out again, i think i was thinking of something more interesting like re-making my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. before i knew it, the show was over. yeah, it's that bad.here's my final thought - there's so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour. don't watch a show that tries to shove racism in your face in vain. i can support shows that try to ease the tension of the race wars but this guy just provides more racism rather than stop it.

some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not. a college professor, david norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. he pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named adam. as it turns out adam doesn't have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold stress and turmoil for dr. norwell. this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around adam's inabilities and seizures. why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out. personally, i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. bypass this yawner.

this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life. rod steiger who stars as the ornery grandfather, charlie, is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is, the better his performance (cue buzzer sound). rod steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film (although end of days is the 2nd worst film i've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. from the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction, it becomes abudantly clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producer's last name ended in delaurentis. the only good thing about this film is that it is so bad, it's truly hysterical. look for the flashback scene where rod where's a jor-el wig from superman and a big black porno mustache. one only hopes that his follow up film, i believe in america, from uber-producer kevin arbouet will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouths.

a trash classic! basically what we have here is a story about a couple of american teenagers (one male, one female both beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychically linked, in that every time both of them fall asleep, they can inhabit each others dreams and express each others innermost desires... think mills & boon meets x-files and you'll be somewhere near the mark. actually, its more like an unhappy hybrid between one of ed wood's famously bad b- movies and a particularly silly episode of melrose place, so tacky are the special-effects and so amateurish is the acting. the actors who inhabit (i wouldn't say act in) this flick say their lines like they're reading from cue cards and pout when they're supposed to be showing an emotion, and it comes as no great shock (or loss to the industry) that they have since faded into obscurity. the whole thing is just a laughably misguided mixture of styles that don't go together at all, and the end result is a intriguing curiosity that no doubt will be lapped up by purveyors of so-bad-they're-good films in years to come. i'll probably be the only person who ever comments on this film, but if you are reading and have seen it please get back, it gets kinda lonely round here...

i was stan in the movie "dreams come true". stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) the acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the fox valley, wisconsin. i saw the movie on the big screen. it played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. i may be bias, but overall, i enjoyed it. also the soundtrack was the band spooner, who later became garbage. my brother, steve charlton was also in the movie. he played swenson the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police.

one of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end. there was just something about the movie that made me zone out. i think because i keep looking back and thinking "yep still in that tree...still looking at the water". poor character development. i felt nothing when they were in danger. i was voting for the croc. i found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat i find that really unlikely as well. the croc seems too supernatural at times ('all knowing all seeing'). also when the croc attacks it's behavior seems very unrealistic. it's a killing machine and wouldn't be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.

perhaps it's about time we declare 2007 to be "the international year of the cinematic crocodile"! the ridiculous "primeval" came first, about a croc named gustave (!) ruling the swamps in burundi. then there was "lake placid 2", a low-profiled and made-for-tv sequel to a forgettable original. thirdly, there's this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of aussie horror and, finally, i have yet to see the promising "rogue". the last one is likely to be the best, considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg mclean ("wolf creek"). "black water" certainly isn't a complete waste of time and film, but it's another pretty pointless survival flick that confuses real-life agony with horror. pardon my bluntness, especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal, but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense! three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas. it doesn't take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide. grace, lee and adam barely manage to escape the reptile's hungry teeth by climbing up a tree. even though he remains unseen most of the time, the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. yes, it does sound an awful lot like the plot of "open water" indeed. replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable aussie swamp, and there you have it. oh well, "black water" at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster. it has to be said, the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water. the three-headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time? the based-on-true-events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions, like limited images of the fantastic filming locations, dialogs and amiable character drawings.

yes, the movie was that boring and insipid. after a certain point, i was wanting the croc to eat these people just so we could get the movie over with.the plot is that three aussies take a fishing tour up a river in a little boat, where the fishing guide straps on a gun. he says he just does it for insurance purposes, all the crocs have been hunted out of this river. he is immediately eaten by a croc. the trio then get chased up a tree, getting picked off by the reptile in their attempts to escape. they spend most of the movie arguing over the best way to escape.predictably, the one survivor finds the tour guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. aww, they killed the movie's only likable character! where's paul hogan or steve irwin when you really need them?

there was some good build up of suspense throughout. the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget. we witness occasional spells of good acting, however, this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines. understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had, sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. silence would have been golden here. there could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering, "i sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother..." something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. you decide. throughout the film i can't seem to find a connection or for that matter, sympathy with the characters, perhaps thats because they don't develop one throughout the film, character that is. there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters, overshadowed again by some questionable scenes. in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated, limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger. a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic.

the presentation is very shabby. (to my notion) as documentaries often are. michael moore's "documenatry" - farenheit 911 is far more convincing but has far too much media and political influence. cant wait till saturday when i get to see the docudrama "the game of their lives" . ifc goes right of center. i have started a collection of ifc movies from off the internet due to "tgotl" *** out of ********** on "decade". wanna see good documentaries? stick to the history channel.. or try docudrama. you cant go wrong with them my friend. cant go wrong. the seventies were ten years of reruns. or so the old times would have you to believe. disco died and it is gone forever. when elvis died o yes we all did grieve

like many western pennsylvania history buffs, i had been really looking forward to this much-heralded pbs program that was produced by pittsburgh's wqed. however, i must say now that i was somewhat disappointed. on the positive side, i believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called french and indian war. in particular, its presentation of the indians' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. also on the positive side, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of "experts" interviews and picture stills (a la ken burns). on the negative side, many of the battles did have a somewhat "staged" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. most of all i was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to forbes's successful campaign of 1758 against fort duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by washington and 1755 by braddock. in particular, i was somewhat incredulous that there was no mention of colonel henry bouquet, the swiss mercenary in the british service who was most responsible for forbes' success. finally i could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 battle of bushy run that started as a re-run of braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of pontiac's war thanks to the wiles of the same colonel bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful british commanders of this war.

few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has. the movie is pretentious garbage. it does not achieve anything at an artistic level. the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india. if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable.now that i've got my distress out of my system, i am more able to analyse the movie: * from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english. the director, of course, did not make the movie for an indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true.* next we get regular glimpses into radha's dreams. these scenes are not very effective. they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. i felt that the surrealism was lost.* the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. in any case, they do not achieve either of the two.* the names chosen for the women, radha and sita, are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. however, since the film wasn't meant for indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd.* the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.* the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role, the others were wasted. i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. the male leads were outright rubbish.in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director, stay away from this one. please.

there's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'murder by numers' because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. however, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. the whole thing is pretty much blown by the "cop side" of the story, where sandra bullock and ben chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. although bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. ben chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'birthday girl') as well as chris penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. it's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. bottom line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks.

having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock's performance in miss congeniality, i decided to give murder by numbers a shot. while decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, ms. bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see hope floats, speed 2, 28 days) leave much to be desired. her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character). the two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream "we did it!" chris penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is ben chaplin's token partner/love interest character.***spoilers ahead*** mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid errors (vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene, an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys hanging out together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc. etc) cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers. the ending was strictly "by the numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion. a somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way. * out of ****.

hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do "by the numbers" hollywood thrillers.this is very lightweight john grisham material, crossed with the plot of a tv movie. bullock is cass mayweather, a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers. ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo. not good, when two unbalanced college maladriots (gosling and pitt) decide to send them on a wild goose chase - by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene.fair enough, but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also have to endure a several dull overly-melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history. then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff-side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set. oooh... the atmosphere.watch any episode of csi instead. it's to the point and far more exciting.

the worst film ever made, bar none. give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it. except for the bit where the hard-luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should...that's all.

i've already commented on this film (under the name thelegendarywd). but i see there are others who have commented since. all i can say is: what the f**k!?". i cannot believe that a whole 16 people have commented on this film or even seen this movie. add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews (probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review - seeing as how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet provider... just look at their movie). although i still admit i got a soft spot for this movie. i thought that some of the other people writing about this one might have it confused with another... until i read the reviews... especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box: "the ultimate in frontal lobotomy" (what the f**k is that supposed to mean anyway? "frontal" lobotomy?)... i totally forgot about that until i read it in the review. people, we are a select few... i say we meet once a year to view this film... wait, does anyone still have it? if anyone does have it please contact me... i'm dyin' to get drunk.

i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like 15. i hated it then, and watching it again, just for the hell of it, it's even worse now. you can hear the director and cameraman in the background yelling commands like "zoom, zoom, zoom!!!". the are no special effects, just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain. this is utter crap, and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought. but this was distributed elsewhere and it's just really weird to know that other people have seen it. whoops i need 10 lines....well....this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how no-budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. this sucks. actually, yeah do watch this just to see if you can sit through the worst. if you can make it through this you can make it through anything.

i remembered this awful movie i bought at camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when i was visiting my grandparents. it was a time when i had just discovered movies like re-animator, from beyond, the return of the living dead, and dawn of the dead. i was ready for all the horror/gore genre had to offer.... or so i thought! i was only about 12 years old at the time so i really don't remember it all that well. i remember a psycho running around with a corkscrew killing people, and a couple of cops (i think) who were riding in a car that wasn't actually moving, but being rocked side to side to look like it was... true cinemagic. i also remember it being the worst film i had ever seen up to that point and i promptly threw it in the garbage.something tonight made me think of that movie (i can't believe i actually remembered the name), so i jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. to my surprise... it was! and a full other 5 people have seen it.... amazing. even though i remember hating the film at the time i sort of wish i had kept it hidden away somewhere because i'd love to check it out again for a laugh (it would probably make a good drinking game movie). anyway, i'm glad i'm part of the elite few that's seen this little "treasure". i would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks.... but beware, this is not a recommendation... it is awful... it's just for nostalgia.

for a while it seemed like this show was on 24/7. then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed. all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish, haggish, airheads perfectly. not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said.i doubt these two ladies have souls, and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series. may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls!

well, the episode i just watched had the older "gastineau girl" whining about why people keep mentioning her husband (mr gastineau, a famous american football player apparently). she seems unwilling to accept that he's the only reason she isn't flipping burgers, she married someone famous and that's why she has cameras pointed at her.when challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does, she gave a wonderfully circular reason for why people should pay attention to her: "i work really hard on my reality tv show". then she said "i'm not a celebrity... i'm a personality."i'm not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to, except people who've had all their intelligence removed. it's certainly no role model to anyone except gold-diggers as the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems.

1940's cartoon, banned nowadays probably because of the 'black beauty' gag, in which daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse.the whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters of the books come to life every evening. so we have, among others, the ugly duck (daffy) and the wolf of wallstreet. they wind up in a chase after the wolf tricked daffy with a phony duck (hence the title).and chase is all there is in this little cartoon, that doesn't have any real appeal nowadays. only fun if you're a true fan of the looney tunes i guess...4/10.

i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings. it totally sucked! i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie - even an ok movie. none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind. to varying degrees they were each selfish and mean-spirited - or abused and damaged personalities who hadn't a clue about the spirit of christmas (when this takes place!) i know canadians and like them - but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie. i'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. a colossal waste of time and money. do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was "worth watching." this person probably would enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia, too. don't mean to be unkind but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking. unless they had ulterior motives. maybe s/he was the director or the producer. if so, i'd like to ask them to give me back my money. if your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece of drek - or rent something (anything!) else. i'm running out of good reasons not to rent this film. if i were canadian i'd be ashamed that it's supposed to be a favorite canadian flick. if so, i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great quantities of powerful drugs. yeck!

i had to watch this one for my canadian cinema course and i was told that it was considered to be the "best canadian film." when i watched this i really did not agree, considering i've seen a lot better ones. i understand that there were canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me (as a spectator) it made me not really care what the film was trying to tell me. the plot was too dry. the characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is to emphasize the messages, not to tick off spectators. this film shows a little about the history of quebec. not a very interesting film; it definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal.

explores the frontiers of extreme boredom. life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation. absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank, deadpan, totally uninteresting protagonist. viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of "altered states".in a groundbreaking study, david snowden found that he could predict alzheimer's thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent. those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose. the essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy.now, why did i mention that? perhaps , my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable, autobiographical, contemplative film which shows, in simple direct style, the bleak and stoic life of a small community, living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos.this film became popular at the height of the quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims. tragically, its writer-director was soon diagnosed with alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide.

first, let me make it clear that i'm a big fan of bad sci-fi, especially when it involves gigantic, city-stomping monsters. but this one is so fantastically lame that i can't even like it for being bad. they apparently didn't shave enough money off the budget by skimping on the props (the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized novelty pencil, available at spencer's gifts for about fifteen bucks), they also decided not to outlay for concept or plot. the monster does look okay, in my opinion, but it doesn't have enough interaction with the backgrounds, i.e. not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. the general rule of giant monster movies is: if you don't have a lot of fake-looking buildings to smash, then you'd better have another fake-looking monster to wrestle with. this movie has neither. i can't make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending, but suffice to say the origin of the monster, and the method found to get rid of it, just don't hold water. not even as well as most of these movies. skip it.

this movie stinks. imdb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. the acting is either wooden or over the top; the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes, those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie. i want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole.

this is an utterly forgettable picture. a friend of mine picked it up in a bargain bin at a local rental place for $.50. he should have demanded a refund. or at least a discount.the plot is something like this: a giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth. thus a tiny holographic space alien appears before a postal worker and tells him that he's "it."the devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie, and on that count zarkorr! the invader fails miserably. the monster zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen, totaling maybe 5 minutes tops (with a generous estimate). the cute alien hologram has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at, and only because she's wearing a "teeny bopper" stereotype outfit, complete with a teasingly short pleated skirt. the climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say "whiskey tango foxtrot, over." in the next moment you are left to ponder whether you've just experienced a train wreck or if someone just drained 3 pints of blood out of you.admittedly though, this movie did deliver one line that my friends and i to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture. as the cast of "protagonists" is being "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them responds to the questions with the statement "what are you, some kind of a question asker?" it is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if you're sitting with a group of friends (who won't be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this) you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter.while this is no manos or eegah (it's not even bad enough to be classically bad) this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog, unimaginative characters, and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom 100.1.5/10

zarkorr is one bad movie. this doesn't even rate in the so bad its good category. it's just bad. from the (lack of) set design to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie stinks. for starters, the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good. then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate. and to top it all off, there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage. the towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set. so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film. and maybe a decent script would have helped too.

aliens let lose a giant monster named zarkorr, then send down a hologram that looks your average stupid teenage girl to tell postman, tommy ward (rhys pugh, in the only movie you ever see him in) that has been chosen to fight. also if he loses the plant goes doom, so he goes off to fight zarkorr the invader! this movie is bad, very bad. so bad it you need negative numbers just to gave it a rattan. horridly written, bad directing, way below power rangers over-the-top wooden acting that you're just whiting for a horde of lumberjacks to come out of no where and cut them down! and don't get me started on the theme song at the end. the people who made this stemming pall of s$@# should not be aloud near a camera or any thing to do with films. zarkorr is a cool looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one. do your self a favour and don't see this movie, it's 80 or so minute of life. the actors that are in this never worked again by way.3/10

ok, so it's a silly movie, but i think they knew that when they made it. and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired, overdone "godzilla"-type genre. borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it, but i did loan it out to a couple pals, who also kinda liked it.

edge vs. michaels-boring in general (loved the sweet chin music into the chair) 4/10 taker vs. heidenreich-one of the worst matches i've seen, predictable as hell 1/10 tripe threat wwe match-why do i watch them, nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble, its not the main event. liked it when show drove jbl through the wall. 3/10 world heavyweight championship-pretty ok match, kind of more a beat-down by tripe h than a match, but i was happy to see it after watching crap. 5/10 royal rumble-good rumble,liked the brand showdown,the hassan thing, and the end. 7/10 overall still crap. why does anyone watch the rumble???

the plot: four people are caught in an elevator. one is a business man, the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking-talking sample of distilled stress and hostility. then there's his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. a teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad, and an older guy who just stole 100,000dm make up the rest of the cast...the movie is all about how they cope with their problem, as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world, as the lights go out, and as the cables begin to snap one after the other....and yet, it isn't too exciting. the characters are stereotypes. the story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator?). you don't like the characters very much, you just hate one of them. and all the twists and turns in the plot are not contributing to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and ink on a full-length movie set in an elevator.let's just hope "phone booth" will be a better effort...

by strange coincidence i've started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice, so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop.unfortunately oss-117 again left me disappointed - i don't know, maybe it's just problem with translations, but since "diner de cons" i haven't seen any french comedy that i would call really good. even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss-117 high notes...for me this movie didn't really work - in some parts is as funny as real bond movies, in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny.

cultural vandalism is the new hallmark production of gulliver's travels an act of cultural vandalism? not literally. after all, not a single copy of the book is burned. but if this is the only gulliver people are exposed toand to many it will bethose people will not get anything like what jonathan swift intended. were jonathan swift alive, hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they'd lose. that's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas.swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. through his hero, gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel big, small, shat on and human. the little people in lilleput are small in every way. petty and stupid, they fight, the big-enders and little- enders, interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table. sounds a bit like us.i forget most of the rest: it's been years since i read it. the tv show reminded me of a few things and, on the bright side, it made me want to read it again.this gift to mankind has been shat on, like gulligan under the boughs beneath the vulgar yahoos, and danson, steenbergen and especially two great actors, peter o'toole and edward fox, ought to be thoroughly ashamed. some "creative person" got the bright idea to put the focus on "the star:" gulliver, played by ted danson, whose acting is just plain bad. he portrays gulliver as insane. all his travels were made up. weeeeel. yeeeaaah! of course swift made up gulliver! naturally, the lands he visited were imaginary: that's called fiction. his purpose was to talk about humankind and our, often awful, relations with each other. the travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method. but these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that hallmark couldn't turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect.i can sure see why hallmark would produce this crap. it's so bad that o'toole, always profound, seems as little as his lilliputian character. he's in character, of course, while commenting on the character simultaneously, as many, if not all great actors do. informing the character sheds light on it. our light completes the character. it becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. most actors do this very subtly, like hopkins in "the remains of the day." others, like nicholson, in most things in the last twenty years, play the two parts pretty broadly apart. nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too: with him it's all cat's cradle and he, chuckling away, holds all the strings. great fun, as is o'toole. but something here is lacking. he is shouting into a megaphone (as great as ever) and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him.that's because it is. look up "anodyne" and there ought to be the word "hallmark" as a synonym. harmless, bland, inoffensive: hallmark is the doll who can't pee because she has no genitals: it is the norm, the average, the person of no distinction. hallmark's hallmark is to have no hallmark. i never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much. suddenly, pound's "disney against the meta-physicals" stands out in bold type. or einstein's "men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds." indeed, anyone, to this mediocre type, who has an answer to any question other than "a)" or "b)" is suspect. who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? hence the act of vandalism. the taliban destroyed the buddhas in afghanistan, the palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are obviously vandalism. hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture; the one that feeds and sustains them. and us.please buy a copy of gulliver's travels wherever you live, and read it. or order it online. i like to use abe books.

someone told me that pink flamingos was, in a word, "insane". now i'm doubting whether this guy actually ever saw it, because that isn't the way i would summarize it in one word. disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting...would do it. every time you think it can't get any more filthy, it does. one of my particular "favorites" was when divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to bust it up, they were butchered and eaten by the guests. i admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away, but this is by no means a creative work of art. it's pure shock value.on the upside, it makes the jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.

alright, so not every australian movie is all that good. yes, maybe there have actually been very few with much merit. take away however is an absolute bomb, qualifying as one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i wanted to like it. i figured i'd give it a fair go. i've even met one of the screen writers dave o'neil so i feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review, but... the plot is fairly thin (i won't bother relating it... read the synopsis), which i can forgive: there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes. unfortunately, take away's jokes cover its plot up like a $2 prostitute's skirt. probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue. take away goes down like a week old dim sim ... you might understand that joke if you see the film but the joke's not worth it.

i usually can tolerate twisted movies, but this one is really a sick obsessive self-absorbed movie!firstly, the writer/director is totally a self-absorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all. secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons children's mind! i can't believe my ears when i heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kids!i really feel sorry for zane adlum and devon matthews. they are both very talented, but fell prey to eric schaeffer's dirty little-known movie!and what the hell happened to eric mabius' good looking face? i mean, he met this girl that he's supposed to marry, but he wasn't in the wedding! in fact there is this bald guy in his place! did time really fly that fast?anyway, don't waste your time to see this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick eric schaeffer!

this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named wirey spindell from age 8 through to 36 told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life. so for example, when he's eight, it's the eight year old's voice that is doing the narration; when he's in junior high, it's that one doing the narration, etc. that's about the only interesting thing about this movie. it looks like each actor playing wirey is a separate character. not only do they not look alike, their life experiences don't seem to match up.avoid this movie like a bad cold.

for years, i've been a big fan of park's work and "old boy" is one of my all-times favorite.with lots of expectation i rented this movie, only to find the worst movie i've watched in awhile. it's not a proper horror movie; there's no suspense in it and even the "light" part is so lame, that i didn't know whether to laugh or cry.i introduced my younger brother to chan-wook park and what a disappointment he got from this. for me, an idol has fallen.if you loved movies like "old boy", the mr & lady "vengeance" or even his short films on "three extremes", don't waste your time, the film's not worth it.

seeing as how i am a big fan of both "fall" and "if lucy fell", i came to "wirey spindell" with high expectations. i am not sure i could have been more disappointed. this had it all, weak dialogue, weak performances... you name it i was let down. oh well, better luck next time eric.

i've been looking forward to watching "wirey spindell" since having happened across schaffer's "fall". unfortunately, i found "ws" to be a wandering, unengaging, boring bunch of claptrap pieced together with, what apparently is schaeffer's signature, a mix of story, narration, and poetry. the film recounts the sexual and other experiences of a manhattan man about to be married through self-narrated flashbacks. like beads on a string, schaffer apparently has strung together every little sexual life experience, while neglecting to tend to the beauty of the necklace. the result is a disjointed rambling story about a boy growing up which fails to engender empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, unsatisfied, and with a bad after taste which taints the mechanical feel-good ending. a mediocre indie and a step backward for schaeffer.

i thought sleeper cell was interesting, and exciting to watch, up until the last episode, when nothing happens, its f****** bs, you americans portray muslims as terrorists, and the americans as hero's, its the other way around, i hate it when every american tv show ends up predictable, i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium, but i knew it would'nt, it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day, yet again, americans are the biggest terrorists, g bush the leader of them all, he is to blame for 9/11, and i'm p***** off that you keep throwing these shows at us, which are all the f****** same! i've a good show about terrorism, its called " the whitehorse" and bush himself the cell leader, its the same with 24, how ever 24 was good, sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2, its f***** joke! and so are you american producers.

yeah, there's a "sleeper" watching sleeper cell and it was me. after reading comparisons to "24" (like on the cover of the dvd), i expected a fast-paced action romp. but nope... this series just putts along. in my groggy half-awake state i would think, "he's gonna... " and, poof, it would happen... "guess that van is gonna roll off the... " and there she goes.and so on.and why would darwyn, in extra-deep cover, pursue a babe? could it be, perhaps, to provide a little t&a? hey, that works for me, hence four stars rather than three.this show is no "24". i've watched "24". sleeper cell, you're no "24".

very dull show. whats worse, its very racist. the white guys are dumb idiots and the only romance is between a black guy and a white woman. there is nothing interesting about this romance, it is not exciting, it is not fun, they don't even seem to care for each other at all, its more like the writers and directors wanted an interracial thing going on. why this is so popular in media today? it is social programming and will lead to no good, there is always tension when too many people want the same thing. this show is not worth the 20 bucks for the season, its a waste of time and harmful to society. at least when they use tv shows to sell products they are more discreet, selling whatever agenda here is quite obvious, and without clear thinking some may feel wrong to oppose it, but some of us know better.

i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic. it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it. i didn't feel the characters at all, is this americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates? the main character doesn't act like a fundamentalist at all, and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine. one of the members, a blonde all-american white boy, would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life. another member, a french ex-skinhead, doesn't quite fit in an islamic terror movement. on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american housewives, which i find very strange. this is just another stupid misguiding american tv show. it is about just as realistic as prison break.

the horror of this made for tv film was that it didn't end with this one. it spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot/movie. most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting. this had none of that. if the intent was to make in "camp" then it succeeded. it resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago and failed again. richard jaeckels performance as the master chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film. campier than the batman series of the 60's.

not only have i read the book and watched the movie, but i was stationed on the uss john f kennedy when they filmed this. needless to say, film crews and actors can be trying to people trying to do their jobs. now, about the movie. as a career navy man, i was pretty upset on how they showed life on board an aircraft carrier. i could pick apart the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone that has lived on a carrier could), but that would take pages. one scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the cic (combat information center) and they were watching a radar contact move across the screen. each time the contact moved, it beeped. unfortunately, that equipment doesn't beep like that (i was a technician on that equipment). the book was based upon fact, the movie wasn't. the follow on tv series was just as bad and the navy finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad. if you're a navy person, watch this to see how a movie about carrier life is seen from the eyes of hollywood. if your not a navy person, watch midway or top gun, at least those movies are entertaining and based upon fact.

it is so bad, i can not tear myself away. i keep asking myself, "why?" "why?" with every scene.there is no continuity, but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude towards all things big, big boats, big boys, big planes, then you don't have to worry about things like plot or character. i am baffled, and very concerned that the cag looks so much like richard pryor. it seems wrong to put a pryor look alike in such a terrible movie. but i can't tear myself away. this movie is the first movie i've ever reviewed. that is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is. it motivated me to join this site. i have counted 50 main characters. perhaps if i was stoned i could follow this, but as it is, i feel like i'm in some kind of never ending bad dream, where it is always 1988, and we were the greatest cocktry on earth.

i'll start by confessing that i tend to really enjoy action movies (military or other). i'm a guy. but this dreck was awful. i saw it for free, showtime or hbo and still feel i paid too much. it was a prolonged episode of general hospital. i gave it a 1, only because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. how or why 59 others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 boggles my mind. unless they are all family of the cast or crew. it might be, this movie was so bad many bailed out.......and as such, were too uninvested to bother.i'm sorry for repeating but the 10 line minimum seems silly, for what essentially boils down to a warning.........in hopes of saving others the 2 hr black hole, this movie represents. trust me, stare at a blank wall, they'll be more action.

the storyline of "the stranger" mirrors somewhat the 1969 film "journey to the far side of the sun" (made by gerry & sylvia anderson of 'thunderbirds' and 'space: 1999' fame). a parallel-universe earth is the premise of both films. but there is a difference. where the world in "the stranger" features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry, "journey to the far side of the sun" merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting, roads, houses, machinery of every kind, and of course internal organs were all in reverse (or mirrored) order. so, the similarity of parallel earths is the only connection of both films.similarly, the tv series "land of the giants" came before both of those films, having run from 1968 to 1970. it featured a world that was nearly parallel to the earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash-landed there. the idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the 'little people' was similar to the premise of "the stranger" more-so than the premise of "jttfsots". perhaps because of the similarly to "lotg", a series to "the stranger" was shelved. had it turned into a tv series it would have been a sci-fi version of "the fugitive," with star glenn corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week, hiding out in different locations, etc. btw, a stronger script could have helped this film along.

stranded in space (1972) mst3k version - a very not good tv movie pilot, for a never to be made series, in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on earth's evil twin. having a planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane as the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun, is a well worn sf chestnut - the idea is over 2,000 years old, having been invented by the ancient greeks. in this version the counter world is run as an orwellian 'perfect' society. where, for totally inexplicable reasons, everyone speaks english and drives late model american cars. after escaping from his prisonlike hospital, the disruptive earthian is chased around not southern california by tv and bad movie stalwart cameron mitchell who, like his minions, wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers - a stylishly evil combination which i fully intend to adopt if ever i become a totalitarian overlord. our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien world's three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home - thus setting up one of those man alone in a hostile world making a new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s ('the fugitive', 'the incredible hulk', 'the littlest hobo' etc.) the curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence. somewhere between 'stranded in space' first airing (under the title 'the stranger') in 1972 and the mst3k version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie 'prisoners of the lost universe'. so in 1991 the opening credits for 'stranded in space' run under a few shots of three people falling into a matter transmitter and vanishing. it's a sequence that has nothing to do - even thematically - with anything that is going to follow.just to add to the nerdy b movie confusion, one of the actors in this nailed on footage, kay lenz, later appeared in a 1994 movie called 'trapped in space'. knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and admiring looks from fellow trash movie enthusiasts - if you could ever work out a way of manoeuvring the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot...

a malfunction in space sends astronaut neil stryker (glenn corbett) off course and headed to something of a parallel world, called terra, circling the sun exactly opposite earth. as a being from space would pose a threat to this world's order, stryker is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him. stryker, however, gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes. with the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who opposes the government, stryker will try to board a spaceship and head back to earth.stranded in space (or the stranger if you prefer) is another of those 70s made-for-tv movies that was to be turned into a regular, weekly show. in this case, it's easy to see why it didn't make it. first off, there's nothing new about the show's set-up. it was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by the fugitive or the incredible hulk or planet of the apes. you know, a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter. it's a formula that's been done to death. the second strike against stranded in space is its lead, glenn corbett. could this guy come across any less likable? i was rooting for him to get caught. without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. finally, this is supposed to be science fiction. just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon i'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet? so it's a mere coincidence that they all speak english, dress just like people on earth, and drive plymouth furies? yeah, right.the lone highlight for me was the inclusion of cameron mitchell in the cast. sure, it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful, but you know the old saying - any cameron is better than no cameron (yeah, i've never heard it either).as with a lot of these 70s made-for-tv movies, i watched stranded in space courtesy of mystery science theater 3000. i wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination, but there are a few good jokes along the way. so in the end, while i rate the movie a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my mst3k rating scale.

this movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick "doppelganger" (an astronaut from our earth crashing on a 'counter-earth' on the opposite side of the sun, and the cold war totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a tv series. however, the whole thing sank without a trace, and tv is probably better off for it.everyone here is perfectly adequate in a 'made for tv' way. cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. so does glenn corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's john saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'world order' on counter earth.but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this sci-fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad.i'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, ("doppleganger"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers.in "stranded in space", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set). i've seen episodes of "the twilight zone" and "the outer limits" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-tv mediocrity.and that, in essence, is what's wrong with "stranded in space". no budget, no time, no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi fan boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. sorry, guys, it didn't work. i'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their c.v. and that's what you, the viewer will do. you'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a tv movie called "stranded in space", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.

a friend of mine, who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself, recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched. however, i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he  or, for that matter, michael elliott  was. the film is a hybrid of house of wax (1953) and the texas chain saw massacre (1974): indeed, i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the 'original' did! so, we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies (guess why that is?) with its apparently harmless curator (a hammy chuck connors) being 'invaded' by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers (among them tanya roberts). he also has a mad brother  shades of psycho (1960) incorporated for good measure, down to the self-same twist  who is supposed to be a mechanical genius (showcased in a 'poltergeist' which unaccountably accompanies the first murder). the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but, being so derivative and not especially well made to boot, essentially ends up merely a redundant (and fairly muddled) genre effort.

greetings;i never thought i would see the day when i would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it... i was always a fan of horror movies, b'c and c's included. but in this case it's hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scale...the movie is centered on a poorly developed back story, a mix of folklore with an after taste. and to top it up, the performance of the actors is questionable. horror b movies usually fall in two categories... 1) a gem that was under looked, and under funded 2) so bad it's funny, laugh or your money back. well this movie falls in between. i wasn't scare, didn't laugh... so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you don't...

i bought this film from e-bay as part of a lot of about twenty horror flicks, all about a dollar a piece. when watching this, my first impression was that it probably was from the late 80s. later on i began thinking - the linkin park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that i was dealing with a more recent film. realizing that, the flick became an unbearable torment. the last 3 minutes were the longest in the movie history - the film just refused to end. is there a genre such as "horror for children"? in that case this film is definitely it. if there are parents, perverse enough to want to introduce their offspring to horror, i suggest this would be perfect for kids of about 6-8. the only thing i really liked was greg cipes who was much too good an actor for that kind of nostalgic retro bottom part of a drive-in double-bill.

*spoilers herein* where do i begin with just how silly this movie was? 'mole sized people, living under the garden attacking residents of a big house'!!! when i first sat down to watch this movie i was unaware that the protagonists where not poltergeists etc but 10 inch high goblins that looked mighty easy to kick hard and far. i carried on watching it because i like to see movies through to the end even awful ones. this movie was terrible. my girlfriend, who went to sleep inside the first ten minutes, apart from finding it a good aid to sleep thought it was hilarious that i had bothered to watch it all.tiny goblins even in large numbers (the thought is silly i know) are about as scary and menacing as flat cola. they only managed to trip one guy up 'fatally' and kill a cat before they were blown up, the end. i did mention it sucked right?

thanks to silly horror movies like "troll" and the indescribably atrocious cult-favorite "troll 2", it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days. only just recently i watched the 70's made-for-tv movie "don't be afraid of the dark", which is basically a quite terrifying and serious-toned film about domestic little goblin monsters, and yet i still couldn't help thinking back about the laugh-inducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in "troll 2". same thing happened to me now. as much as i tried going into "inhabited" with a clear mindset, unconsciously i kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of nilbog! still, even without all the prejudices, "inhabited" is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straight-to-video horror flick. it's a cheesy, soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and northern europe mythology. the annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren't your plain average goblins; they are "the huldre": wicked little norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children. this overcomes the russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town. the cherubic blond daughter of milf-actress megan gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden. she claims her friends are fairies, and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past, gina's parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood. when she keeps rattling about fairies, they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist dr. werner whilst "the huldre" are slowly coming out of their botanical shelter. not much special to mention here. the pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute. you understand this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here. heck, even the cadaver of the family's pet cat is kept off-screen. this is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which malcolm mcdowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable, greedy and self-centered authority figure.

this might not have been as horribly bad as it was if not for the absolutely awful acting job done by raymond wallace! this guy is so bad it wasn't even funny! his character was needed in the film, but why they chose this guy is beyond me. if you're looking for some quality chinese films.....might i suggest "raise the red lantern"...."the story of qui ju"...."red sorghum"......anything but this! i was surprised at how many people actually rated this highly! really...the acting by this wallace loser is so bad it overshadows the other good parts of this film. this was agreed upon by all 6 of us watching this movie last night!stay clear of this piece of garbage........

it may be difficult to believe, but the basic plot of this abysmal flick has been lifted from hitchcock's perennial classic, "vertigo". to see edward james olmos in the part once played by james stewart is heart-breaking; sean young is better, but still a poor substitute for kim novak.

after i saw this i concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward i found out that keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. however, a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts). one item that i believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene, in the movie, whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w/o anesthesia. though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! women understand this even better. i suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. in fact, a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste. though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really "excels" in that department. this could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of dylan thomas during wwii; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against dylan but really muddles this. instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of. in a way. perhaps. somehow. of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! a lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though i have stated that already i will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess.

oh my god! the beeb hit a new low with this gutless act of political correctness, a mixed race family living in birmingham with a disabled kid thrown in for good measure. whoever commissioned this tripe should be hunted down and thrown to the dogs. the usually funny jasper carrott is about as funny as piles in this show and don't get me started about the others. they have the timing and subtly of a nuclear bomb. i only hope comedy will get better but with the likes of little britain and catherine tate about i severely doubt this. i think you'd be better off getting the box set for a decent comedy from yesteryear such as fawlty towers or bottom if you want a laugh.ban this squeaky clean rubbish!

an odd, willfully skewed biopic of dyan thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (sienna miller) and childhood love (keira knightley). matthew rhys plays thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and cillian murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet.the film never seems to decide on where it's going. there's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. miller is the choice of the two (i found knightley competent at best but then i have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent welsh accents. other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of william (murphy), arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10

this movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being "feel good" and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it. i can't imagine how the inner circle of norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star-packed premiere. its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the norwegian media scene is. had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves.the combination of literally amateur actors, home-made style visual effects, awkward dialogue, painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot, really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality. stay away.

this is one of the most awful movies i've ever seen, probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless blueberry. how can harald zwart even have put his name on this crap. i'm feeling every ounce of respect i had for him waning fast.so what is it about this film that makes it so poor? is it the story? yes. is it the actors? yes. it it the whole "look and feel" of the movie? yes.to start off with the story, my god!it's about as cliché-ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14-year old who is late writing his/her paper on "what i did this summer". the feel-good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the story.the actors are amateurs, i know, and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. but for this to work, the characters have to be charming and/or funny (preferably both), so that the viewers don't mind the cheeky acting, or perhaps it even adds to the characters. in this case, not even close baby! you start off disliking the characters mildly, and by the end of the film (i think it's about 90 minutes long, although it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys! it should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid hickeys. their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes, only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground. even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very, very embarrassing (i'd rather have my sister make a fool of herself on american idol).finally, why cram in a bunch of misplaced norwegian celebrities? they look even more out of place than the actors, if this is possible. these celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see-through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inception.i cannot even begin to stress how much i'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again...

i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as i expected - based on the other reviews that i have heard.other than 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original "emmanuelle" (1974), emmanuelle arsan, 2. the lead character being a sexually free spirit, and 3. being set in the exotic locale of asia, "laure" doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor.i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that i'm really not that interested in, i.e. the voyeuristic, open relationship between laure and nick, "i'm just happy with whatever brings her pleasure"...something along those lines. i cannot relate to this mentality and the film/characters don't really shed any light.the second half about finding the mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film. one that i didn't care for. by that time, i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest.maybe i just didn't get it.i'll leave it at that.

might end up being the biggest disappointment that i will see in 2009. i seem to be the rare person who disliked park's oldboy, but i think that his "lady vengeance" and "sympathy for mr. vengeance" are among the best films i've seen in the 2000's decade. therefore, i really was looking forward to see this, especially as it got such positive reviews. instead, i found the film clichéd, and broke little, if any new ground to the vampire genre. and while i can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, i felt park did this at very inopportune times.others have compared/contrasted this to "let the right one in," and i have to say that "let the right one in" was far superior to this one, and was a fresh take on the vampire genre. sadly, park's take was a tired one.

there were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. i never bought into that stuff. the "screwball comedies" were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the fred astaire films.here, barbara stanwyck plays a famous "country" magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years, and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). she even lies to a guy about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in classic films.she's a new york city woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track. i guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. please pass the barf bag.most of this film is not funny. stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. as for dennis morgan, well, pass the bag again.

oh god! it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. i would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote. why? i saw it in a theatre! see this film on dvd or on tv! the shooting is really really poor!!!!! it keeps shaking all the time, in a completely tasteless framing!its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema. you got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat! it's really a shame 'cos, the story is edited in a non-linear way which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. watch this at home!

you should never ever even consider to watch this movie! it is absolutely awful! this isn't an overstatement!! it is so unbelievable and exaggerated, it gets boring. it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one. they writer hasn't been able to pull it off in a good way.if you'd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you, but still, you should plug your ears and just watch. it's not worth listening:p there are so many great movies out there, and if i could choose one, this would be the last movie i would pick. but all in all, it's your choice!!! enjoy!

while traveling with a team of misses for the dispute of the miss galaxy, the airplane piloted by maximus powers (eric roberts) and mike saunders (charlie schlatter) crashes in an isolated, where lays noah's ark protected by the jurassic pork. while the group fight to survive, alien apes plot to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate planet earth.i like parodies, but "miss castaway" is an offense to human brains. the awful story and the special effects are very, but really very bad. there are spoofs with "lost", "castaway", "jurassic park", "sixth sense", "titanic", "planet of the apes", "raiders of the lost ark", "congo", "mib", "perfect storm", "austin powers", "jaws", "mission impossible", "close encounters of the third kind", "star wars" and "hulk", but the problem is that most of them are very silly and not funny. in the end, the trailer is better than the film. my vote is four.title (brazil): "missão quase impossível" ("mission almost impossible")

first, i would like to apologize for my rating of "1"... the only reason i give this film such a high rating is that i can't delve into negative integers. all "this is a spoof" musings aside, and while i certainly have tried to give it due consideration, have left me with a certain notion, namely; "this is quite possibly the worst film ever made." on any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement... seriously, i tried, i'm just as in to any indie born-for-cult-video-distribution film as the next buff, but seriously, this movie sucked rhino balls...honestly, if i had directed this "film" i would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide.

do the following: get a copy of this movie and a friend. wager the friend $10 that they can't sit through this entire movie. they cannot divert their gaze or be distracted by anything. now watch your friend. win or lose, you get $10 of entertainment.it angers me to no end when people see a movie and are quick to give it 1 out of 10, or sum up their thoughts with "it sucked". (and when asked "why?", they respond, "just because." arrgh.) that is why this movie exists. it's sole purpose is for me to say, "there! this is a horrible movie! that is 1 out of 10!".this movie is absolutely appalling.while the recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become increasingly formulaic, this movie falls short in every single aspect. it's not funny. it's not entertaining. and for some of the parodies, it's completely inaccurate! horrible acting. unfunny dialogue. a witless story. terrible "special effects". one inane gag after another. and to make matters even worse, there isn't even gratuitous nudity to somehow make it even fleetingly worthwhile.this movie leaps past idiotic, stumbles over stupid, and lands face first on moronic. even i, who loves a good "check your brain at the door" movie, found myself physically agitated watching this. this movie isn't even "hard ticket to hawaii" so-terrible-it's-good bad... it's just bad.note: i actually challenged a friend to watch this as described above. not only couldn't he make it all the way through, but he had a headache and needed a couple minutes afterward because he felt a little ill. true story.i could not accentuate this rating any more... a resounding 1 out of 10!

this movie (even calling it a movie is an overstatement) is ridiculously horrible. normally a huge fan of eric roberts in "b" list movies, this tragedy of a flick makes me question his real b list clout! and charlie, please go back to hoping for a diagnosis murder revival rather than this.....you can't blame the nameless eye candy (uhhum...beauty pageant members) for participating in this weak movie, but you are a former tv star man! pull yourself together. don't even get me started on stuart pankin. for the sake of all that is good stuart, you should have seen this was not necessarily a real movie! bryan michael stoller exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to dupe anyone into investing in this picture (money or time).really, this was no parody or spoof movie although it tries on a 2nd grade level. mostly, it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and....well poor everything. i watched it because i read an article in some mag about agent mj's involvement and my interest was peaked due to the lawsuit in which he was involved. i now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders up in the movie is because he, like at the trial, showed up wearing pajama bottoms and barely lucid (wait a second, is he ever really considered lucid?...i digress). and agent mj? is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character? sheez. what a startling piece of originality! or, maybe that was supposed to be funny? putting marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first, but overdone and annoying after all is said and done.spare yourself the grief of watching......don't say i didn't warn you.

i actually enjoyed tycus, if not for much more than mocking the production values. dennis hopper was just fine, although i wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used. and furthermore, what was with the scene with the ninja?? that was just completely out of pace. perhaps someone came up with the bright idea mid-shooting. oh well, this movie is great if you're drunk and need a good laugh. cheers.

it's certainly a direct-to-video, but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think. i quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time.the hero's reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human. the hopper character is actually playing god. that might be the right thing to do, but one may not like that anyway.in the end, the god player is doomed to death, and the hero, who would have spent his own life, can live. quite a morale. :-)the most unrealistic thing i saw, is that earth is doing so well with no moon stabilizing its rotation.

i have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie. i can agree that the movie is not "armageddon" or "deep impact" quality. nevertheless, if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so, then this is a movie that is bearable.i started looking at the film early in the am hours as i was doing some geek stuff. it was very nice, because i was able to switch back and forth between what i was doing and watching the movie, with out missing a beat. it is a predictable movie, and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors (for instance, dennis hopper).but i should point out that i paid only $2 (us) and as the old adage goes: you get what you pay for! if you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again, then this is definitely the long video. on the other hand, if you looking for something to pass the time, then there is nothing wrong with tycus (which incidentally was called "comet: final impact" in mexico where i found this video).

the only people i would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf, although i'm sure a sadomasochist would get a kick out of it. this film had nothing; no acting, terrible music, awful script- only the power to suck any happiness from your soul. you may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer inanity, and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself. firstly, i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable. secondly, i only made it without gnawing off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. the problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes, and that was a fatal error on my behalf. i normally like films to leave you with something by the end, but all this did was take..... for the sake of your sanity do not watch this film.

worst.film.ever nothing more needs to be said. aaron carter is utterly repellent and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately. it really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end. i wish i could be more eloquent in describing the movies many (oh so many) flaws however i cant be bothered/get too angry to form proper sentences. in short i absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad its good" kinda way...it was unadulterated drek.gavin

this movie started out as a quite decent-looking film but it never really kicked off, instead it became predictable and even a bit silly. some scenes were quite well made, the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch, but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive. and more importantly, its not scary at all! it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting..to be frank, the actors weren't all that great either, no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days..overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it, it wont last long until its already forgotten.the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores, but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10. if you still want some japanese horror, i would suggest you watch ju-on instead!

ok, let me start off by saying this isn't a horrible movie by any means. it's just not good. i recall one poster saying the acting isn't campy it's just nuanced. no. i've seen nuanced japanese and asian acting. i'm sorry, you're wrong. this is camp.the characters are totally unsympathetic, the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless. the writing is bad. i'm fine with suspending disbelief, i'm fine with not having everything handed to me in terms of plot. but this movie has no plot. one reviewer stated "this movie is set in a small town where people are going nuts over vortexes and spirals." that's not a blurb, that's the entire freaking film. congratulations, i've just saved you nearly an hour and a half. there is nothing more to it. no character development, no plot development, no explanations, no resolution. and not even the "acceptable within the realm of j-horror" lack of resolution. just nothing.in addition, the musical score is done by someone who obviously wasn't actually watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause whiplash. cognitive dissonance is one thing and done well it can be brilliant (see dark water), but here it just seems as if the score was designed to go with another movie all together.the best example i can give is it's as if the japanese remade evil dead without any of the clever bits or good acting. it just falls flat. it's j-horror without the horror.

although the acting was excellent, i spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to so many of the characters, get his final nemesis, and instead everyone else suffered except him and he gets the job of the husband whose wife's death he causes by running away from his friends, wins the girl he gave an overdose to and tried to rape. even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect completely fails to return to its cause.this is a very dark film as each character that gets affected, suffers never ending depression. none of the normal avenues for relief seem to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is give out quantities of stress pills.if this is normal behaviour in finland now, i'm never going to go back just in case i am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up as destroyed as the characters in this film were.

i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it, so please humour me.its only redeeming virtue, outside of some good acting, is that it doesn't go on past 107 minutes. even that length is about 30 minutes too long.comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark 'the grifters,' but i can't see it. they are two different films altogether. the closest 'swindled' comes to an existing film is 'the sting,' made in 1973. it borrows (sorry, steals) liberally from this splendid george roy hill 'entertainment,' which is exactly what is was. i enjoyed it because it didn't pretend to be anything else.there are so many red herrings in 'swindled' that i thought i was in a fish tank. it's very confusing, but that's only one of its many problems. the principal one is this: if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else, where everyone is conning, we have no 'anchor' to ground us. the inevitable result is a mish-mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks.just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable. surely a basic film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to 'care' for someone. we can't 'care' for anyone here: they're all swines. it might have worked as a rakish comedy, but it plays it straight from beginning to end.if you want to see this film, read no further. big 'spoiler' coming. sorry, but i have to do it.there's so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn't strain credulity -- it destroys it. the ending is absolutely ridiculous -- a 'murder' in a crowded airport that isn't really a 'murder' at all? and the 'murdered' guy, blood-soaked, simply stands up, brushes himself off, and walks away, fake blood dripping, with the booty? all while the police and hordes of people are looking on, and no one intercedes? the director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we're supposed to buy into this. noirish b-movies from the 1940s did better. i'm a great fan of european flicks, but this confirms that schlock doesn't always come from hollywood. as far as 'swindled' is concerned, my judgment lies with a famous line from the oft-misspoken producer samuel goldwyn, who knew all about schlock: 'include me out'.

i liked most of this film. as other reviews mentioned it has a good cast, the plot is interesting enough. all in all it is fun to watch.but the ending, i feel, is completely botched, it left me bewildered. yes, you expect people crossing and double-crossing each other in this sort of movie, but quadruple-crossing? well, if it's justified by the plot then why not? but that's the bad part, there's completely no need for it. after a certain point it's all scheming with completely no meaning. (here comes the spoiler). after the airport scene enrico and his accomplices already have the money. i couldn't understand the need for the rest of the scam. is it all necessary just to rub federico's nose in the fact that he's been fooled? i don't buy it.so 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the ending.

i felt that the movie skammen, directed by ingmar bergman, was very dry. it shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of these actions; however i feel that it was not complete or attention holding. he never fully got into the plot or deep into the character emotions or reasons behind their actions. the only thing that i found rather attention holding in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters, jan and eva. many times during the movie was just the two main characters sitting around or doing their daily chores and not even having a conversation. i understand this was to show the reality of these people however i feel there are other ways to show reality and have it be entertaining. i think that ingmar bergman could have filmed this movie in a more riveting way.

i just recently viewed shame which is directed by ingmar bergman. the film was interesting and very unique. i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white. these features allowed me to better relate to the characters, the time period, and their stories. i didn't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn't know what was really going on. at first, it was mainly a story of eva and jan's relationship. the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie. i probably would not go see shame again, but it was a very cultured experience.

some movies are not for everyone. this accurately describes igmar bergaman's movie, skammen (shame). at only 18, i still have what i guess you could call a minor form of add and well, i watch movies to be entertained. shame was a movie with a very interesting premise, of trying to convey the effect of war on the common people, it however fell short of accomplishing this for me. i don't know if it was the subtitles, black and white filming, length of the movie, or the fact that it took two hours out of my studying for a huge chemistry test, but i did not enjoy it. i understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema, however, i think as my teacher pointed out, not everyone has liked or likes it. i guess i just wish it finished all of its many side plots. maybe the translation lost something, but i felt there were infinite little off shoots that never met a conclusion. you would meet characters and never see them again, or really understand why they were included in the movie. my overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing, but only to form your own opinion on it. whether or not you like or dislike it, it is necessary to respect the point that it is trying to convey.

kidman and law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. kidman pouts andpines wistfully for her absent lover law. she's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the south in the civil war, and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. law's main direction throughout seems to be `look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' rene zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `annie get your gun.' yee-hah boy howdy! something about her character felt more like it belonged in a monty python sketch - the one from `holy grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason. kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a victorian era novel.whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `cue the simon legree-type villain!' and teague (ray winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts, like kill and torture innocent god-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingconfederacy. all other times, he's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. there is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. these are the characters law meets as he does his johnny appleseed trek from the front lines, where he has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of kidman back in cold mountain. ultimately though, none of these characters matter. law has no time for them or their lives. each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is gol-durn heck, and turns otherwise decent christian folk into rabid animals.and the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. moreover, the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow. you spend the entire movie waiting for romeo and juliet's inevitable reunion, with kidman wringing her hands and sighing, law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. and when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. you'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure.i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. there is a potent anti-war message here. the incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. but it's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.

another tiresome bore from anthony minghella, who seems to thrive on these big bloated super-productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes.the story centers on inman (a somnambulent jude law), who goes off to the civil war having just barely started a sort-of romance with nicole kidman, a preacher's daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town. the story cuts back and forth between inman's trials and tribulations at war (which is, guess what boys and girls? hell!!) and kidman's trials and tribulations back at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring). renee zellwegger appears on kidman's farm to help kidman get it back into shape after kidman's saintly daddy dies of inconvenient character disease. zellwegger acts all squinty and bossy in that granny clampett kind of way, dispensing enough tough love and homespun wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of touched by an angel.this film is, quite simply, excruciating. avoid it like the big bloated oscar-bait bogus pretentious literary adaptation nonsense that it is.

what gives anthony minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction?? first, he destroyed the english patient, which was bad enough, but now i discover he's butchered cold mountain - butchered!!!i had such a strange reaction to the english patient. my son and i went to see it the first weekend it was released, and i was so disappointed, but told my son i felt like i needed to read the book. i drove straight to barnes and noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said minghella had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie-going public to give them a great film. that is what he most surely did not do. i do not ordinarily read a great deal of fiction, but cold mountain was so highly recommended by friends that i felt compelled to read it. i did not see cold mountain, the movie, when it played in theaters, and it was because of what minghella had done to the english patient. but like a fool, i rented it today, and i'm so upset, i had to vent my frustration and, most of all, my sadness, that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen, and now they never will. read the book and let the movie rot on the shelf. i will never be taken in by a minghella project again. i think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and i'm tired of the praise hollywood heaps upon his head. it must be that no one in hollywood reads anymore. this movie bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. minghella's ego must know no bounds, and if he didn't like the book, then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone. even if i hadn't read the book, i would still consider this movie one of the worst i've seen from 2003; and i've seen almost everything that's been released for viewing in the usa.elaine, you aren't going to like this one either.

the two leads, an englishman and an aussie filming an american civil war story in romania, have not the slightest spark between them, are utterly unbelievable as lovers, and wholly unsympathetic. there is no story, no characterization, virtually nothing to keep the eyelids separated during this interminable bore fest. renee zelwegger, also hopelessly miscast, practically chews the fence posts, but at least watching her embarrass herself provides some comic relief. nicole kidman is a decade too old for the role and has not the slightest idea what's going on. jude law's moron role could have been played equally as well by any of the romanian extras. the only requirement is to wander about the forest looking stupid while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show. not that it mattered, because all of the guest star roles were completely unnecessary as they did not advance the so-called plot by one iota. and as if all that wasn't enough, the auteur felt it necessary to throw in some spinning, whirling, kung fu jumping off horses. what was that about?

jude law, nicole kidman, and renne zelwigger. they are all horrible. especially the star, jude law. it's directed by the same guy who did the english patient and its based on a best selling novel of a man risking all to get back to his lover but unlike the wonderful english pateint, this movie sucks. it is really bad.worst dialogue ever. "but we've only know each other for a moment" "but they were a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag"or "in some cultures you just have to say i marry you 3 times and you're married" lovey-dovey-"i marry you, i marry you, i marry you, i marry you..."i'm ashamed i sat through it all. the whole movie was awful, horrible....ughh no words, i'm sick.1/10 (the one is for the really loud bullet sounds, the sound crew did a good job)

her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role. her face remained too white, hair too coifed, clothes etc. too clean (and well-fitting, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect, too, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. there was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek. are we to believe she was the only person in the civil war with a bathtub and a mirror? she certainly looked like the only one who used them. tweezers, too; i mean, what's with those eyebrows? she looked absolutely mean!the love story was implausible. she only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute. so, she goes over to tease him, then flirts with him a couple more times, and suddenly this is a love on a par with odysseus and penelope? please.i should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us "the english patient." my reaction to that one was the same as elaine's on seinfeld: "it sucked."

i found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting, even though a few parts of it were ridiculous (i.e.. philip seymour hoffman's character). the last 60 minutes were distasteful and i began to lose interest in the film. the last hour lasted forever, it seemed.the movie is nicely acted and i can see why rene zellweger won an academy award since her character was so interesting. the movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one. however, i found the message to be a bad one: not surprising these days in hollywood. in this story, "inman" (jude law) deserts the confederate army during the civil war. his reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. he's also getting disillusioned with war. (can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars??!)yet, in this film of course, all of that is perfectly acceptable. then again, what liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the u.s. military?? to add to their left-wing slant, they portray a vigilante-like posse going after deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. well, in the world of films, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good.....and only liberals would portray deserters as heroes.

i had to write a review for this film after i saw it last night and read some of the comments of people trying to classify the displeasure of this film go down to wfmitchell's post)). i don't fit any any of those classification. the other classification that needs to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it was not good. i found the film to be booring and forced. my wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge kidman fan and she also likes jude law.speaking of law, it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent. i can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much.as far as the movie, it took a long time for it to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in it's ending. what was interesting, is that i did not know that this film was directed by minghella. about 40 minutes into the movie, i asked my wife "this isn't going to be another english patient is it?" it absolutely was.as far as the battle scenes. i'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but i think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply "dumb". it was forced, it was unbelievable, it was silly and it was dumb. (after the battle i looked at my wife and asked "was that just dumb?" to which she vigorously nodded her head).the only bright point in the film was the performance of zellweger. the role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. from her speech pattern, her walk, her mannerisms and esp. her little quips (my favorite: "if you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other"), she was able to create an almost cartoon-like character who did her job extremely well.i simply did not like this movie and i have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it (or the english patient for that matter). i suspect you could categorize them in one category: 1) soap opera fans

jude law gives keanu reeves a run for his money as the most wooden actor around, renee z's character is straight out of the beverly hillbillies, and the two leads have about as much chemistry as darth vader and queen amedala. the "bad guys" are the worst kind of cliche, and there's not a subtle moment in the film. incredible that some critics actually liked this movie.

this movie really has nothing going for it. with the reverend played by phillip seymour hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie, you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in, literally. it's a waste of good talent, and a total embarrassment. dreadful!

critics are falling over themselves within the weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based. minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this "civil-war love story". are they kidding? after ms. kidman and mr. law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small north carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate. who cares? philip s. hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to renee zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of kidman's lonely farm to save the day. rarely has a performance screamed of "look at me, i'm acting" smugness. her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin. released by miramax strategically for oscar and golden globe (what a farce) consideration, the weinsteins apparently own, along with dick clark, the critical community and won 8 globe nominations for their overblown failure. the resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful pr-driven films become obscure. cold mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time. cold indeed!!!

***mild spoilers*** dear inman, kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie i have just been subjected to that stars you. the problems are far and wide and painful for me to recount. . . yet i feel i must, if only to prevent others from suffering the same anguish as i did. this is not a film for anyone under 50, it's sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the big reunion of ada and inman happens. . .the biggest and most important scene in the film, nothing happens, it is a epic letdown. now, like the director should have done, i will keep my words short and end with this warning, your film is disjointed, boring, has no flow and jude law is tragically mis-cast, he showed more emotion as a robot in a.i. - be warned, the film should be retitled . . . bored mountain. love, ada

this movie was so bad, i thought i was going to scream in the middle of it. it was all i could do to sit through it. the beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising. only it smacked of "saving private ryan" to me...or at least an attempt at it. only we don't care for these people. there was no build up to the characters. the kid that dies i guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone. then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic "wuthering heights", which of course was also quoted in the movie. go figure. there was nothing original about the movie at all, it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better. sadly it doesn't. 3 hours later, i leave the theater feeling cheated. anthony menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the english patient, which for it's time was a good movie, but now i wonder....should i rent it and make sure i wasn't just caught up in the hype??? maybe i was, but i definitely wasn't caught up in the hype of this film. i really went to the theater wanting to like this movie. i am a die hard nicole kidman fan. save your money, rent it on dvd and laugh through it, as i did.

i was really excited about seeing "cold mountain". alas, like most movies i'm really excited about seeing, it was a letdown! were it not for that miraculous invention called a dvd, i think i would've put my head through the monitor, i was so bored!i closely watched kidman and law when they meet because their characters are supposedly "destined" for each other. yet law's face showed anything but dumb-struck love, while kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! zellweger's character is pure granny clampett (as if we don't get it, cornball banjos mark her every entrance), and so over the top, it was all i could do not to laugh! ironically, her performance serves to highlight just how stiff-as-a-board the leads are.ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. more perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for negroes (as they're politely called here). why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? and for all of ruby's practicality, when she dispatches ada's "evil" rooster, that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens!by the time her beloved finally returns, ada doesn't need him or anyone else -- which is the big joke! indeed, she may be physically intimate with inman, but her real intimacy is with ruby, who has turned ada into an über-babe version of herself. did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, as they left inman behind?i doubt that minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an anti-bush movie. inman tells us he is "like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie", and ada's father says "i imagine god is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument". these "observations" are historically inaccurate and insulting. while slavery was the basis of the south's economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. it was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, most in the rank-and-file were indifferent to it). for filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious.structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. law and kidman are miscast, and have zero chemistry! the script is little more than half-baked dialog, and an egregious bunch of clichés and banalities. "small moments like a bag of diamonds?" ugh!

first, i am a big fan of alien and alien ii - in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the si-fi horror genre as we know it today. i noticed lifeforce was often compared to the aliens saga - after viewing this movie i would highly disagree. there are some okay special effects with the alien vampires, and the story line might have been acceptable. i just can't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie, this is absolutely absurd (although she does look good). add in a bunch of bad british acting and it's pretty much over. most of the movie ends up taking place in london or somewhere in england, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real si-fi horror action and suspense.

a poorly-paced sf/horror venture that takes itself much too seriously, memorable only for (a) the beautiful mathilda may wandering around naked through the chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. it has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments, and some unintentionally funny scenes, but is mostly a waste of time.

usually, any movie with steve railsback in the lead is a good movie. however, this movie does not conform to that opinion. lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning (reminds me of star trek: tmp), but is able to pick things up a bit towards the end when london becomes zombie city. a horror/sci-fi mess that is very hard to sit through, although the naked spacegirl/vampire is very easy to look at. this movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.

even though this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes good pyrotechnics. its plot was terrible. its horror wasn't really that good. its sci-fi was even worse. but its pyrotechnics were excellent! (mathilda may was extremely beautiful too.)

there is so much bad to say about this movie and so little that's good!the plot has enough holes to sink the titanic, the characters are completely unbelievable, the monsters are so unrealistic, and i'm sick and tired of seeing movies that involve an ex-husband and ex-wife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency - it happens far too often in films and it's become another bad cliché.i find it hard to believe that anybody would have invested $1 in making this garbage, never mind the $100 or so it must have cost.you could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! i didn't think movies could get this bad! avoid it at all costs - do something that's more fun and enjoyable, such as having a tooth pulled, or an enema!

i thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it. well, there's no sexual content but as for being a "fun comedy," i only remember laughing a total three times during "the green butchers." the hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just sick humor, in a bad way.i should have walked out of this film and i'm kicking myself because i didn't. in fact, i shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place. the only good that came out of this film was was the fact that bjarne and his brother finally made amends and put their ugly past behind them. i advise any well-meaning individual to steer clear of this gross-out flick.

if this movie was made two years earlier it could have been a lot better. but unfortunately, it was made in the decade that had no idea about how a horror movie was supposed to look or act. when i first heard about this movie, people on imdb were classifying it as the sequel to cheerleader camp. oh how wrong they were. yes, betsy russell was in it but uma thurman sure wasn't. i'd really like to find the person who started that whole sequel rumor. i'm sure a lot of us would though. i'm not gonna give anything away because frankly i don't remember how this movie even ends! i'm just gonna tell you to watch a real camp horror movie... the burning starring jason alexander, fisher stevens, holly hunter & the geek from fast times at ridgemont high. a word to the wise - just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title, doesn't mean its gonna be worth watching. oh, and another thing, any horror flick made in the early to mid 90's was ever considered even remotely good!

why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty? well its deductive logic my friends, you see i know god exists because satan does, how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film? yes there is no doubt about it, on a cold friday in the year 2006 satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film. he what? you wonder; the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings, why would he waste his time in making you watch this film? my only conclusion to that query is that satan believes watching camp fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues, instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever. can this film be as terrible as he says? yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times, maybe more. but maybe i am being too harsh, this film does have a few moments in it, the beginning for example, starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls; now never being in a sorority i am unsure if girls really do this, but hey one can always pray. now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archaeological class, where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. flash forward the professor of the class (who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently) takes a handful of his nubile students, plus girlfriend, to a remote lake in the mountains, their quests, to find ancient indian artifacts; yeah right professor, we know what angle your pitching. now this is where the movie gets going, the group of five, four girls, one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions, but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls, only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways. moving on they get to a "campsite" consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong. first the prof. and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them, only to be captured by some unknown force. continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers, plus one drunk guy, come looking for them, their plan, to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. the movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand; but their is a hitch to this plan mr. druid, one of the girls is devirginized right before us, so away goes that plan. now since i said there would be spoilers i'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you, the four girls get taken, drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed, after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof. come to save them; they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says, "i think i can make it down there!" only to leap down and break his leg. the prof. runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rape-minded-now-heroic biker left to fend off the 6'3" giant druid. first he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife, the knife reflects some lazer beam within a gold snakes mouth and lights the druid on fire instantaneously. afterwords they carry the wounded away via emergency stick stretchers and ponder if everything is really over, only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives. in a nutshell that is the film and this is my review, which unfortunately will go unread by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years. thankfully satan can only get to some of us and not all. the judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl at circuit city i am going to let borrow this movie; "i'm sorry sheila, please don't hate me for letting you watch this."

this movie starts out the way every movie should start out, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and/or topless. a couple of them take showers. i'm liking it so far! unfortunately, we then meet or main characters. they're just not particularly likable. usually in these movies, the actresses aren't really acting, they give very "natural" performances, and they're quite sympathetic, fun, and likable. not here. they don't have much of any personality and i didn't care for them much.some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. on the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. the biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it's just plain stupid. the head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as john bon jovi for halloween. the girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.i don't really know what the heck happens after that. there's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious indian dude who keeps disappearing. somebody gets eaten by a cheesy lock ness monster thing as he's swimming across a lake. some guy in silly makeup is apparently a druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world. or maybe cause the end of the world, i'm afraid i wasn't paying much attention. first he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.it could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn't even live up to my grade z schlock expectations. they really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things. instead it's all over the place. overall, if you're looking for late '80 schlock, i imagine you could do worse. if you tried really hard. there's plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.

this movie is so irredeemably bad, nothing about it makes it worth seeing. no effects, no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered. oh, and neither a camp or any fear does it contain. do yourself a favor and go see the original friday the 13th or (preferably) sleepaway camp, but what ever you do, do not see this movie. even michele bauer's appearance at the very beginning can't save it. usually, in these kinds of films you expect violence, suspense, and a little gore and some t&a. the violence was poorly executed, the "suspense" was laughable, there was no gore, and the t&a is plentiful in the first 5 minutes, then, nothing. at least one of these things, properly done would have at least made it watchable. to say at least one nice thing about it, buck flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up. if everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun, no pun intended.

oh my. started out with such great potential - a bunch of cute sorority girls walking around practically naked, check. then off to a bar where the 80's cheese gets turned up a notch, check. off to a woodsy state park the next morning, check. a bunch of girls and their professor, rowdy bikers, a general store guy, and that dood from they live acting as the local drunk - makes for a nice body count, check (and speaking of body count, notice the strong resemblance on the dvd cover to the foreign horror flick - body count! aka camping del terrore). a whacky indian in the woods doing some sort of ritual, hmmm, ok i'll let it slide, check. and then, oh brother, all downhill from there. terrible. the lochness monster head in the pond had me cracking up though.

a handful of nubile young college sorority sisters decide to go camping with a professor. a giant druid want to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse come the year 2000, they also have to contend with bikers, an indian and a loch ness monster type thing. worth watching for only 3 reasons, george 'buck' flower (a sadly unsung b-movie staple) is on hand as a hobo and the other 2 belong to the stunning savannah (in one of only 3 non-porn roles she had). both have very small roles. too bad everything else in the movie is horrendously bad.my grade: d- retromedia dvd extras: original trailer eye candy: 4 pairs of breasts, 2 asses

i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie "far north", and even though i loved her in her one other film "slow" (2004) where she plays "francis", this is by far and away her strongest role.lynn, as i'm sure you all know (or should), plays the critical role of "driver".unfortunately, other than lynn's amazing performance, i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it.oh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers. memorable lines like: "you son-of-a-gun!", "you son-of-a-witch!", "shoot!", and "well, forget you!"o.k. bye.p.s.: does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster?

of all the films i have seen, this one, the rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. the direction, logic, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. "how could anyone come up with something so crappy"? gary busey is know for his "b" movies, but this is a sure "w" movie. (w=waste).take for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. inside the jeep is ma and is "confused" as to why all the cops are about. within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, ma being killed straight off. the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.

aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot, this movie wasn't too bad. unfortunately, that doesn't leave much movie not to suck. do not waste your time on this film, even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia, as i did. watch an infomercial instead.

too bad, i really like kristen cloke and gary busey. but the director failed to put this together. there's a lot of action, a lot of promise, but it all comes off hokey. the director didn't do his job. promising action comes off lame. so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. this version of "the rage" (directv credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. another director would have done a better job.

heart of darkness was terrible. the novel was difficult enough to understand, but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it, then that just messes everyone up. not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others, but the acting was horrid and the overall impression i got from the movie was that it was a complete dud. i watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better, but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely. i think the movie was a waste of time, and i was disappointed to see tim roth in such a disappointing film, especially when he has awesome flicks like pulp fiction and resivior dogs under his belt. same with the very cool john malkovich.

heart of darkness, a short novel written by joseph conrad about greed, corruption, and traveling through africa was, to say the least, a tedious read. the narrator follows marlow, a seaman who travels into the deep of africa to rescue kurtz, somewhat of a prodigy ivory trader who supposedly went crazy, this conclusion arose when the ivory stopped coming into the main port. the basis of the story is conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings, he sets the scene wonderfully, but possibly a bit to extensively. the story seemed more like a water color painting, as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that conrad might have intended to pan out.it sometimes happens that after you read a book, maybe watching the feature film might help correspond some thoughts with those in the book, or vise versa. not so with heart of darkness, even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor john malkovich the movie only confused me more, there seemed to be no real main characters in the film, no one stood out to the others, non of the extensive symbolism was explained. it was rather bland and drudging to say the least.in all do respect to the author, the heart of darkness is a true short novel masterpiece, it touches on some very severe subjects, the lies of marlow, and the greed of kurtz. it is not a book to be taken lightly, and will put you in a rather somber mood. a book like this i feel might be to heavy for a lot of people. i would however recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo action story without a textbook happy ending.

after completing the lackluster novel, heart of darkness, i moved on to watch the movie, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. at the onset, i expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book. however, even though i had read the novel, the movie still made no sense at all, so i can't imagine how lost i would be if i had skipped the book altogether. it seemed as though the writers picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie, and left out anything that may assist the viewers in comprehending the meaningless plot. this dreadful movie made no sense at all, and i would strongly recommend against watching it, as it will do nothing more than leave you completely baffled and bewildered.

joseph conrad's novel, heart of darkness is a dark, profound, and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in africa. if you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you. conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. if i read this novel looking for a great adventure story i would say that i wasted my time, but looking at in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization, i would say this is one of the most significant novels i have ever read. because of the fact that i read this novel in my english class, and we analyzed every page, i think i appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment. i am not going to lie, this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. the movie on the other hand i found tiresome and boring. the movie, "heart of darkness" comes no where near giving the book justice. the movie left out many key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story. if you are having difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel then the movie might be a good recourse but i would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.

roeg's take on conrad's "heart of darkness" was not quite what i had expected. although based on one of history's most studied and interesting texts, the film just became sort of dull. the story just never manages to grasp the viewer. it just comes across as indifferent in a way.the traces of the text are easily spotted, but still this is not really conrad's "heart of darkness". benedict fitzgerald's (who also wrote "the passion of the christ") script just uses conrad as an inspiration, and thus becomes fitzgerald's "heart of darkness". the film is just not worth it, unless you are particularly interested in conrad or perhaps john malkovich.

bloody birthday opens to a shot of meadowvale general hospital. there three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse. a caption informs us that it is now 'meadowvale, california june 1, 1980'. two teenage lovers, duke benson (ben marley) and annie smith (erica hope) are getting down to business in an open grave. they hear noises and duke investigates. both duke and annie are murdered. sheriff jim brody (bert kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a child's skipping rope that annie was holding, as a clue. unfortunately before sheriff brody can solve the case his youngest daughter debbie (elizabeth hoy) and two of her friends curtis taylor (billy jayne as billy jacoby) and steven seton (andy freeman) murder him. just as they are finishing sheriff brody off another young boy from their class named timmy russel (k.c. martel) turns up, the three killers are unaware of how much he saw. soon after the incident timmy plays with steven and curtis in a junkyard. curtis locks timmy into an old locker. timmy manages to escape and tell his sister joyce (lori lethin), but she doesn't believe him at first. the three children carry on their murder spree. their strict teacher miss davis (susan strasberg) a lovemaking couple (john avery and sylvia wright) in a van and debbie's older sister beverly (julie brown) are among their victims. joyce begins to have her suspicions about debbie, curtis and steven which makes her and timmy a target for the evil trio. will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?co-written and directed by ed hunt i have an intense dislike for this film. i think it's absolutely awful and doesn't have a single enjoyable aspect to it's 83 minute running time. the script by hunt and barry pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children don't have any conscience, so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? if that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday's before starting their killing spree? i guess it just suddenly kicks in, right? to it's credit it is reasonably well paced but i still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through. the film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable, the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as i've mentioned next to no motive is given. it's very silly at times, too. check out the scene where debbie stops steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! the sheriff's death is put down to him falling down some steps, yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident aren't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality, any competent doctor or pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds. there isn't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative. there is some out-of-place looking nudity as debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister beverly strips. there is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing. the general incompetence continues throughout the film. the whole production is bland and instantly forgettable. the acting is poor throughout, those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore, especially curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses. i just hate this film really, simple as that. i can't think of a single good thing to say about it. definitely one to avoid.

anatomie was a german made movie and subtitled.it was also overlong and boring.if it was supposed to be a horror movie,it failed miserably for me.the actors went through their paces looking more like they wanted to be some where else.the film work was ok but more attention should have been applied to the awful banal script.i paid nothing to see the video and i still feel cheated.go read a book and save your money.

this is by far the worst non-english horror movie i've ever seen. the acting is wooden, the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally braindead. it's not even scary. 2 out of 10 from me.

he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. and if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.yes, this is from nietzsche's aphorism 146 from "beyond good and evil". and that's what you find at the start of this movie.if you watch the whole movie, you will doubt if it was the message that the ram gopal varma production wanted to pass on. as the scenes crop up one by one, quite violent and at times puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget the nietzsche quote and think otherwise. that to deal with few people you need dedicated people like sadhu agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone, not just writing firs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are made to believe).when tada was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, rgv's "satya" did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like india. within a year mcoca was passed.when real life encounter specialist daya nayak 'became a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by mcoca, "aab tak chhappan" was made to heed out "false" impression among the people about this. with it's "you have to be a monster to save your nation" approach.and people consumed it. no questions raised. only praises and hopes that they get a sadhu agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. blood? you can ignore.every time israel attacks palestine or lebanon, we hear voices like "india must also similarly attack pakistan". this movie is made for such psychopaths. if you don't give them this, they will probably die out of boredom and lsd and what not.hence this game of the passion of hatred.

finally got to see this movie last weekend. what a disappointment..it barely reaches "made for tv" level. given the list of actors, i would have expected something substantially more sophisticated. the movie lacks a good story, well, actually any story for that matter. it has no credibility, instead lots of predictability. save yourself the money and the time.

this movie is not at all like city of god, you might get the same feeling but it isn't, there's no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes, you get the idea. if you ask me i think this film was a waste of time, there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than "wooden camera". yes i might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it's only in my opinion. it's one of those films where i can get the feeling that i'll be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and i all gave mutual looks, and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. so to conclude this matter, i advise not to watch it.personal note - making africans talk english was a big mistake. in city of god they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality.

don't get me wrong. i really love the "arena-martial arts genre", and i get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there. this one is one of those, and it's not even close to be one of the best. with mathias hues in it, i thought it would be good. he can't save this movie though, and to be honest, he wasn't very good either. just don't pay attention to what other people say; the fighting scenes in this movie are not good at all. i really know what i'm talking about, since i have seen so many movies like this. there are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. i guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer, in addition to manifest the bad guy as,uuuuuuh.......bad (like we didn't know that already).

i laughed so much when i saw this film i nearly soiled myself !. awful acting, laughable effects (super imposed explosions), and dodgy slow motion fighting.one of the worst films i've ever seen !.

and i still don't know where the hell this movie is going? i mean really, what is this movie about? is it about demonstrating sean connery's complete lack of arabic? is it about showing that if he could play the role of a moroccan warlord then he was a natural to play the role of ramirez in highlander? why was teddy roosevelt even in this movie? why was there so much sand that was put to so little use? where was there so much table slapping? why did teddy ignore the japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? did he realize the man was japanese? why was no no credible excuse given for connery's accent? at least jean claude van damme has an excuse for his french accent, whether it be being raised by french nuns in hong kong (double impact), being raised on the bayou in louisiana (universal soldier), or having a french mother and being raised in indochina (i cannot even remember the name of that movie)? can anyone explain this?

i live in mexico city, so i have to suffer throug the trailers for every piece of trash that comes out from all these stupid mexican filmmakers. you want to admire a mexican guy for making great films? take a look at something by guillermo del toro (specially the devil's backbone), or maybe alfonso cuarón (though i really don't like his films, but i respect them).mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most terrible utter trash ever (por la libre, el segundo aire, american visa), but this is one of the lowest points in mexican films ever. if you respect your brain, please avoid this piece of **** at all costs. it would be more intelligent to watch some video of a wedding or to watch britney's reality show. that's got more iq than everyone in this 'film'.

i have seen tons of trash, in every language, about every topic and of every trend of film-making. from every period, every director and any kind of budget available. that said i really have to declare:this is one of the three worst movies i have ever seen.it's painfully bad. it's pompous. it's grim. it's incomprehensible. it's annoying. it's a really bad mess. it is a piece of you-know-what.and, what's more important: it lacks a point. and even if it had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thing.it's just weird for the sake of being weird.i actually felt sick watching this trash. the theater where i saw it (lincoln center in new york) was full when it started. by the end of it, half of the audience had walked out. there was a q&a programmed at the end but nobody stayed. with the exception of about two sickos everybody else ran for the door, myself included. save 2 hours of your life. it's probably one of the worst ever done.if there is a movie theater in hell, this movie will be playing 24/7, for eternity...

cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of mexican cinema, a rare feat nowadays.it's pretentious: it wants us to believe that it is deep, only because some scene is out-of-focus, another is pseudo-surreal, yet another plays with the eisenstein-infante-caifanes tradition of laughing-crying faces, the edition is fragmented, and it is all so solemn.it has a weak script: the main story hardly develops, so it has other three smaller, needless stories, stuck into it. they are only good to make the film last longer.most of the acting is bad. a true feat, baring in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast.there is an abuse of unnecesary foul language. to the point that the character of paloma, who symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child, uses it throughly.it is homophobic. the character played by eduardo palomo is the sorriest, and most punished, representation of a transexual i have ever seen.it is very boring. i ended up envying the people that left the theater before the end of the film.whatever it tries, it has been done better, in mexico and elsewhere.in other words: "para partirte la madre, nada como una mala película"

luscious candace bergen as a prim victorian beauty, kidnapped by sean connery as a devilish desert sheikh! how can you go wrong? how? oh, let me count the ways!!! earthy, primitive sean connery, exactly the right man to tame a brittle, classy beauty like candace, is . . . well, underwhelming in the role. that's because, instead of having dialog about the real issues ("you are a woman . . . i am a man!") he has to babble nonsense about "the will of allah" and "the wind blows destiny across the desert sands." john milius, a director known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has a maddening way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like candace might get kissed. instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated to endless, (and i do mean endless) shots of brian keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and delivering gritty sermons on the joys of being teddy roosevelt. i have nothing against teddy roosevelt, but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't excite me the way the love story between candace bergen and sean connery would have . . . if it had ever actually gotten underway! the weird thing is, milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution. candace's two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does. there's no humor, no chemistry, no sizzle, in any of the things that happen to her in the desert. unless you think it's funny that after weeks of galloping around on horseback her hair is still perfect.the only "real" moment in the story is when, late at night, candace bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says, "we must escape." the little girl turns over and, without missing a beat, replies, "but mother, i was sleeping!" that one line sums up what's really missing from the story. no danger, suspense, or sizzle in the basic story line, of a cultivated lady in captivity. she (and her children) are both so snug and well cared for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate.mind you, if candace herself had said the line it might have worked better. if the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity, (or her delight at being in the arms of sean connery) and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction, then the story would have had some tension. but milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether teddy roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. in the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him . . . and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless . . . like the burning desert sands.

apart from the da (james eckhouse), and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen gulden's (renee zellweger)plight, ellen herself is the only convincing character--and likable character in the movie. she is the one, not her dying mother, who should be and is--the one true thing. it's not only in the role, in zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself.... until, the plot turns against itself--and makes the mother the "one true thing" in the eyes of her weak willed, shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter. the daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter. to boot, the one powerful scene in this whole movie, when ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is given the lie at the end. ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father. a very flawed movie--so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time.

what really amazed me about this film was that it ringed so false. first of all, who in the late 80's (when the film takes place)lived like this family? a college professor wouldn't make enough money to support the lifestyle i saw on the film. hence, he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes, especially when she gets cancer. second, streep is my age, and most women, particularly in her class (educated, white, well off) experienced the feminist movement. yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior. i actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need.the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing. i have admired carl franklin's films in the past, and i actually like meryl streep, but gad, what a manipulative and lying film this is.

unlike terms of endearment and steel magnolia's, i left the movie theater feeling very disappointed. i started to get into the characters and their complex mother/daughter and father/daughter relationships at the beginning. i even cried. but i had no sympathy for the characters with the ending. the final act did not seem in line with the mother's character at all. so, although the acting was pretty good, i thought the movie on a whole was disappointing.

i appear to be in the minority on this one, but i found one true thing to be schmaltzy, contrived and generally unpleasant. not that the acting was all that bad, but the characters seemed little more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he's not unredeemably bad; maybe there can be a resolution at the end . . .). admittedly, the woman i was with loved the movie, so maybe you'll like it. but i didn't.

one true thing may have seemed like a horror movie to the yuppies of the 80's, but it doesn't ring true today... unless you happen to be part of a pampered, upper-middle class family which is so insulated from the world that it has never tasted suffering.avoid this shallow flop.

although inevitably linked to the 70's decade, the concept of "exploitation-cinema" is actually nearly as old as cinema itself. moreover, universal studios practically invented the term with their long running monster cycles dracula, frankenstein, the wolf man and the mummy. every original classic spawned a couple of sequels, at least, and after a while they even thought up the idea of making genuine monster stewing! "house of frankenstein", released one year earlier and also directed by erle c. kenton, was quite a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiast performances, but "house of dracula" is a little too loony for me to recommend it. the plot suffers too much from extremely irritating 'coincidental' situations, forced twists & dialogs and  most of all  a far too short running time to elaborate the monsters' personalities like they deserve. onslow stevens doesn't receive top billing but plays the most fundamental role as miracle a doctor who's challenged to cure count dracula (carradine) from his incontrollable thirst for blood and fix lawrence talbot's illness of mutating into a hairy wolf man whenever the moon is full. during a nightly walk in some caves, they also pick up the remainders of frankenstein's monster and the good doctor himself eventually undergoes a jekyll/hyde metamorphosis due to a bad blood transfusion. the last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback (though not of the notre dame). something is very wrong when you're watching a movie that is literally stuffed with horror icons, yet the only character in the whole movie that is able to freak you out is an ordinary villager going by the name siegfried. the actual monsters are dull and their once-fabulous backgrounds are fully drained. count dracula is a whining romanticist, talbot is a pitiable and also whining old martyr and the frankenstein creation  well, his share in the plot isn't even worth mentioning. there's a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this universal film, especially compared to all their other efforts, and the abrupt climax is a disaster.

okay -- the title "house of frankenstein", was a reference to a line from the original frankenstein movie. when they follow it up with a movie entitled "house of dracula", which makes no real sense, you know that it's just beginning to turn into a franchise.without explanation, dracula is back, and he's calling himself baron latos. he infiltrates the home of a doctor edelmann, with the claim that he is seeking a cure for his vampirism. edelmann has a hunchback nurse who assists him (what is it with hunchback assistants in these movies?), but what dracula is really interested in is his other, more beautiful assistant. at this point, larry "wolf man" talbot returns (again, no explanation given) and just happens to be seeking the same doctor for a cure to his lycanthropy. and then he just happens to fall into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him, which also just so happens to contain the frankenstein monster. dear god, when will it end ... sure, the other universal monster sequels were silly, but this is just ridiculous.first the good stuff. there are some great settings, and the vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual. some of the other effects are pretty neat too. john carradine isn't bad as dracula once you get used to him, but still nothing like as brilliant as lugosi was. in my opinion, onslow stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, although he has exactly the opposite problem to carradine -- all of the creepiness and none of the class. none of the performances are that great, but it's more due to the atrocious script than anything else -- the female parts are particularly badly written. but stupid as it is, it remains reasonably entertaining for the most part. the best thing about it is it's short length.now the bad stuff ... it's not creepy, it's poorly written and it doesn't work. i was hoping the three monsters would begin some kind of a supernatural struggle for power, but it doesn't happen. the focus is almost entirely on dracula, who isn't particularly well portrayed. on the other hand, this is the only movie in which dracula infects another man, but it is done via a blood transfusion rather than a bite as universal were always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. larry talbot is decent as always as the wolf man, but he plays a comparatively small part. once again the part of frankenstein's monster is reduced to the anti-climatic closing moments. for god's sake, glenn strange was fantastic as the creature! why not give him more screen time? it's unfortunate that the series had to end on this note (not counting the classic comedy "abbott & costello meet frankenstein"). in the end it just fizzled in the sunlight and died, much like dracula himself.

i watched this film when i was a kid, and i thought it was terrible then. now that i'm older, i found it just as terrible. universal could have done better than this. they merely decided to make the most money they could out of using all their monsters at once. to me, that was a cheap shot. these characters were capable of holding their own in their own movies, and the choice of actors was deplorable. dracula needed to be bela lugosi, frankenstein's, monster needed to be karloff.in my mind, it was the disney squalid sequel sequence done decades ago, and it was not appreciated. umiversal started out with something great and original, and then thought they could pander to the masses with the schlock which is extremely evident in this film.

it's proof that movie makers and their financiers treating their audience with contempt isn't a new phenomena as it was done as early as the 1940s and house of dracula is a great example . you'd think having a film with dracula , the wolf man and frankenstein's monster the producer would dictate to the screenwriter to have all three appear in a scene . they had a chance with house of frankenstein then when they had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with house of dracula . to lose one chance is a misfortune , to lose two smacks of cynical money making it's obvious the producers are beyond caring . larry talbot turns up again even though he was shown to die in the previous film which sums up the cynicism of the franchise . it also shows what a poor screenplay it is and we're mistreated to some awful plot turns like talbot's condition being cured by a special type of plant which will soften his skull . i'm thinking screenwriter edward t lowe might have had his skull softened if this is the type of stuff he comes up with director erie c kenton can't improve on the script and throws in a few spanners of his own . for example talbot is startled to see dr edelmann snatch a lift on a cart but nonchalantly watches edelmann climb a wall and jump in to the château courtyard . one can't help thinking talbot's reaction shots were mistakenly switched round at the editing stage lon chaney jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies but didn't have much of a career outside them . perhaps that's down to the fact he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting - being very wooden . it's not entirely his fault though because all the characters spout rather awful dialogue and are all rather wooden due in part to kenton's lackluster directing house of dracula feels a million miles away from james whale 1931 film and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to end on . but ironically universal decided to make one more movie to wrap up their franchise with a horror comedy starring abbot and costello

i've been a classic horror fan my entire life. many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on "horror incorporated" and "creature feature night". sadly, i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to sleep.i don't think i've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything was so matter of fact. dr. edelmann doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural, yet before long he's medically treating dracula and watching larry talbot change into the wolfman while hardly blinking an eye. he and talbot discover the frankenstein monster like it's an everyday occurrence. edelmann is all fired up to bring the monster back to life, but after talbot, miliza and nina protest he's like "aww, you're right. no big deal". after realizing dracula's treachery, he opens the count's coffin to sunlight and poof!, he's gone, just like that.the only person who didn't appear to just be phoning in her lines was jane adams as nina. her reward is getting bounced off the hump in her back into a pit by the frankenstein monster at the end of the film...and no one even tries to rescue her! she, dr. edelmann and the monster all perish, while talbot and miliza casually leave the castle.definitely the low point for universal during it's classic horror years.

in 1904 tangier, a wealthy american woman and her two children are kidnapped by berbers, murderous desert pirates who scorn the moroccan government and, by doing so, kidnap "american pestilence", which attracts the attention of u.s. president theodore roosevelt. fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of "the king and i" interjected, besides). portraying the cloaked, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his snippy, haughty captive, sean connery and candice bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue, and both seem singularly without proper direction). the various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we don't know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become blurry, noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. the pluses: a much-lauded music score by jerry goldsmith (oscar-nominated, but a loser to john williams' "jaws"), fine location shooting and cinematography. *1/2 from ****

i have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie. this is another gathering of monsters just like the house of frankenstein. not exactly a masterful plot, but universal needed to capitalize again.dr. edelman (onslow stevens) is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department. he is working on the cure to keep larry talbot from turning into the wolf man. somehow count dracula happens to drop by to get a fix on his vampirism. and rounding out the good doctor's experiments is the restoring of the frankenstein monster's energy. along the way, the kind hearted doctor's blood is tainted with that of dracula.john carradine plays dracula again. this time he is more convincing. lon chaney jr. as usual is the soulful wolf man. glenn strange is the frankenstein monster, who has very little to do this outing. also with mentionable roles are lionel atwill and martha o'driscoll.

i guess the previous "house" movie was a hit, prompting universal to wring a few more drops from the monster cash-cow. the creative team must've been in a recycling mood, starting with the opening theme lifted from 'son of frankenstein' and some of the stock footage dispersed through the film, like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of glenn strange as the monster is mixed with clips of karloff from 1935's bride, and compared to how robotic strange moved, karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison.previous film continuity is thrown by the wayside, concerning the miraculous death-cheating abilities of the wolf man and dracula, but when dr. edelmann & larry talbot discover frankenstein's monster with the skeleton representing boris karloff , edward t. lowe does at least acknowledge some of the past movie history, though talbot curiously never mentions having met karloff's dr. niemann. since this was to be the last of universal's horror cycle, the supernatural elements of the wolf man and drac get(unconvincingly) morphed into medical ailments. drac is told he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare sickness that allows him to transform into a bat or evaporate if sunlight touches him. >:-] and larry talbot just has a little pressure on the brain. of course all of this is painstakingly explained with a 'lot' of medical jargon being related in many scenes throughout. this proves to be the biggest hindrance, as somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as treatable as a flu. as a huge fan of the old universal horrors, it's rare that i feel so bored while watching one. the whole thing just feels like a movie that was made just because it could be, but if this mess hadn't been slapped together, the monsters might never have met abbott and costello, so i guess some good came of this.

i'm not picky with movies, oh i've seen so much crap i could watch anything. maybe that was the reason i watched this one to the end. im big fan of rpg games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is. the security-camera footage of a game-play would make it feel more realistic than this movie does. the lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. in some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when !!!!!(spoilers ahead)!!!!!people running around does not disturb people sitting near computers. i mean would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you? oh and the jokes about pirates, that's the worst one yet in movies!!!!!(spoilers end)!!!!! at least first one felt like a documentary, now it looks like someones home video experiment. you can find better movies at youtube. top line: don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.

i can't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme. totally unrealistic (they seemed to want it to be highly realistic but all the elements are based on clichés), real propaganda stuff. after seeing this, an addict probably just want to continue his/her career :-) i gave it 2.

yes, this bizarre feature was written by john sayles. shot in toronto, it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. into this mix comes the myth of wild thing, a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take (maury chaykin) and chopper, the local crime lord (robert davi). stir in the local do-gooders (priest sean hewitt and clueless social worker kathleen quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences. davi is the standout amongst the cast, and cinematographer rene verzier does a pretty good job. otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves sayles' admirers slack-jawed.

whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted, the script was dull. plodding and nothing we have not seen before. not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger. no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution. i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest. after all, didn't everyone on the planet see "schindler's list"?

i watched the version with pathetic american over-dubs, maybe this made it much worse, but from what i could make out the film was pretty bad anyway. it seemed low budget. the visuals reminded me of a second rate tv movie, random white dog substituted for dogmatix, embarrassing 60's bbc costumes, etc. mainly though, i feel like the characters in the movie did not behave anything like the characters in the comic, and as a result i never felt willing to even try to forgive the poor look of the film. it is always going to be hard to capture the feel of the comics in a film without using animation, and i didn't feel this attempt was worth it ultimately.

god, did i hate this movie! i saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago, and i still have bad flashbacks. it was, without a doubt, the worst movie i ever paid to see. it was badly written, badly directed, and (surprisingly considering the cast) badly acted. i would rather be thrown off a rooftop onto razor sharp spikes, and then have my skin peeled off, than to sit through it again. can you guess i didn't enjoy it?

a very carelessly written film. poor character and idea development. the silly plot and weak acting by just about the ensemble cast didn't help. seriously, watching this movie will not make you smile. it may make you retch.

what a frustrating movie. a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows. this does none of that. instead, the writers settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. the thing looks like a made-for-tv movie, and was directed with no particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting.the most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this--well, there's no other word for it--drivel. a tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great stockard channing.

this movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named curtis killing people. the other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge, brown, ugly glasses. the actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to revenge of the nerds.another thing that i hate so much about this movie is that curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. i kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? he sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. another thing i hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that.then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. that didn't make any sense and neither did the music. the music didn't fit any of the scenes.this movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. watch a different movie on your birthday.

let's not fool ourselves, okay? we all know that this film was made because of the success of the "grumpy old men" movies. unlike those, however, this travesty has zero humor and very little heart.gloria dehaven is the sole shining light to be seen. it breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of moviegoers, only to end up in a piece of dreck such as this. there was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with. her fine performance was the only quality acting going on in "out to sea". everyone else is just going through the motions. 2/10

this was one of christie's later stories. throughout her long career, she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of conflicting agents. both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation.in detective fiction, the game is a matter of conflicting realities. the murderer intends to change reality to fool the detective, the writer intends to do the same to the reader. both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see. that's why her stories often include a writer.in her works, she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this. along the way, we often have bodies that are not who they seem, and times, and intended victims and such. but the real magic of the books is this notion of control. in 'bertram's' it was literally a building.here, it is a dead man. well, sometimes that happens, but not like this. it is as if the writer were the famous mr. rafiel. this is particularly sweet to marple readers who remember this same character from the 'carribean mystery,' which in a way was also framed by her nephew. in that story, rafiel was the conveyor of the story to the authorities.the producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one. sometimes it produces bland work. the 'bertram's' episode was rather brilliantly staged. this one is the most lavish of the lot, and has an active camera. but unlike the 'bertram's' work, it has nothing to do with the story.the camera moves and captures merely because it can. the 'citizen kane' quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt. this story is good, but the adapter took out some pretty critical stuff, and that irrelevant camera annoys.ted's evaluation -- 2 of 3: has some interesting elements.

sorry this was a woeful excuse for a film.. a plot line so holey it resembled a block of swiss cheese and a butch of characters who seemed to me to be utterly devoid of inter-personal relations.. well except of course for carlyle and lee-miller who i could have sworn were meant to be in love.. unlike the union of tyler and miller who were for the most part, like the rest of the film, utterly unconvincing.. although the end product was uncaptivating and amusing for all the wrong reasons, the production values were high and deserve some acknowledgement..but unfortunately the end result was rubbish..what was everyone involved thinking..? they definitely should have packed up early on this one..

if you have few expectations, then this will entertain for 90 minutes. my problem is that they've dumbed down this tale for the modern audience. highwaymen are already sexy, exciting characters. they don;t need the techno soundtrack and snappy dialogue.

plunkett and macleane are two highwaymen that rob from the rich in order to give to ... well, the rich; comparatively, they are the rich. but we know they're the good guys because the chap behind the forces of law and order, a mr. chance, is just so evil. he rapes women - or tries to. he beats up his underlings. he commits murder. he has bad breath. he doesn't shave properly. he has no fashion sense. he tortures puppy dogs. that last one is just an inference of mine: we don't actually see him torture puppy dogs. but i'm sure he does. little of chance's villainy has much to do with his pursuit of plunkett and macleane. it's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of a hobby he takes up to make absolutely certain that we don't like him. he needn't have tried so hard. no-one in this film is likeable.let's take stock. appealing characters? there aren't any: i believe we've covered that. swashbuckling? not a swash. instead we have a kind of grimy heavy-breathing. dash? sparkle? vigour? all gone the way of swashbuckling, i'm afraid. realism? none of that, either. i think they were trying for realism, since everyone was so filthy, but the characters and action had all the plausibility of errol flynn - with no sense of exhilaration to back them up. beauty? nope. fine camera work? for a tv crew, perhaps. humour? you might giggle once or twice if you're in a benevolent mood. then again, you might not. dialogue? see `humour', above. music? don't even get me started on the music. the music in `ladyhawk' was, by comparison, uncannily apt; and at least the misguided aesthetic of that score was a consistent one.ugh. i apologise to `ladyhawk' for even thinking about it in this context.to sum up: there's much positive badness here and nothing good - unless you count liv tyler, which i'm in two minds about doing.i feel as though i've just written a review of the pox. `not very good,' the review says. it would be much more interesting if i could somehow defend the pox, to claim that critics of the pox have got it all wrong - but i don't know how i'd go about doing that.

if you need a clue as to whether playmaker is decent or not, look to its star, colin firth, who refers to it in an interview as "absolute rubbish -- i sincerely hope no one ever sees it."the script and plot are ludicrous, the female lead is unconvincing. the only thing worthwhile is colin firth, and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout.for diehard firth fans only -- the shower scene alone is worth the $3.99 you might have to shell out, should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did.i'm happy for mr. firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over!

if it wasn't for colin firth, the movie would be ready for the dust bin! so foreseable, so silly and so badly acted!! only colin firth, as always, shines through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnel!!the worst was jennifer rubin's acting, for sure! maybe it was because of this script (did they actually have really written one or was it just made up "on the way"???).to cut a tooo long story short:it is a must see only for colin firth fanatics (like me) since he is incredibly sexy and good acting (struggling hard against this "mentally challenged" script). these minutes of colin-screen-time make up a lot of this movie. don't spend too much money on it, though. try to see or get it as cheap as possible (an auction or something like that) and then do stick to the colin firth scenes. the rest of the movie might be dangerous for anyones mental health.

i never heard of this film when it first came out. it must have sunk immediately. :o) i saw it on cable while sick in hospital so i hardly had enough energy to watch it, let alone turn the channel. better choice than the style channel. ;0(. filmed on location, this travelogue should have been on the travel channel. the plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties. the cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties. donald o'connor, star of musicals and edward mulhare as a card shark. as to the main cast, walter matthau is still playing the same part as he did in guys and dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl? wiseacre irresponsible gambler and rounder. but it just doesn't take with a man of his age. as to jack lemmon, he plays his part so straight, he can hardly dip and glide when dancing. and as mentioned, dyan cannon is outstandingly attractive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks walter is rich, while he thinks she is rich. elaine stritch plays dyan's mother, another retread from the fifties. the most fun is the running feud between brent spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots walter as a poor dancer, and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage. in the end, though he receives his comeuppances. meanwhile jack mopes about, meets an attractive woman, with mutual attraction, but their affair is broken up by walter's lies that jack is a doctor, when he was actually a retired department store buyer. but finally, the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane and all is well. there does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty.

sadness was the emotion i felt, after the screen went dark. puzzled, was another. why would two seasoned screen vets like matthau and lemmon sign on to this putrid project? i'm under the impression they didn't read the script, before the cameras started rolling. all the cast is wasted, in this unfunny, uninteresting and unimpressive movie. sadly enough, this was one of elegant edward mulhare's last projects, here as the heavy. dyan cannon tries, hal linden looks bored, donald o'connor reciting a few lines laden with profanity. (??!!). i'm not with the "legion of decency." my point is they were spouted purely for the strangeness of hearing him use off-color language. that is a desperate attempt to infuse "humor" into a picture. he actually did deliver the film's only morsel of entertainment, when he pattered about on the dancefloor, though. i save my harshest criticism for the leads. walter matthau should have known better. he still delivers great solo performances (iq, dennis the menace, etc.). his character, although affable, is rather dull and one dimensional. seen him once, seen him all. jack lemmon gives another one of his trademark, weepy, "just too darn sensitive" male portrayals. when he starts that mode, i vicariously want to hand him a box of tissues. out to sea is painfully unfunny, and whoever produced this mess should be made to walk the plank.

dear mr. seitzman, or whomever i may hold responsible for mr. seitzman not meeting his rightful fate of being eaten alive by rabid wolverines;i do not know you, and so cannot comment on your character; for all i know, you give to charities and help little old ladies cross the street. still, i must insist, for the common good, that you never write another screenplay as long as you live. put down the pen, step away from the laptop! if you refuse to heed the pleading of wounded brains, i have watched a movie or two in my life, and i believe you will find my counsel helpful: 1. do not include love scenes in which overwrought teenage boys name the body parts of their girlfriends after us states. if you must pen such a scene, please do not name the breasts "new york" and "new jersey"; it causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples. also, it is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying.2. do not rely solely on john hughes movies in order to reinforce class distinctions.3. do not bludgeon the audience over the head with exhausted clichés. yes, yes, kelley and sam stand out in the rain, and it cleanses them of their cares. we get it. yes, the roses continue to bloom in kelley's dead mother's greenhouse, even though every other plant has begun to rot. it is a symbol of their love. it is also very painful when applied via blunt-force trauma to the backs of our heads. for the love of god, mr. seitzman, we get it. we all get it, all across the land. amish people, the hard of hearing, unborn babies - we all get it.4. do not require the actors to perform mime sequences. ever. no, never.5. did i mention that you should ease up on the trite symbolism? because the audience can draw the parallel between the rebuilding of the restaurant and the building of the relationship between kelley and sam without any help. truly. we get it.6. go through your script, and cull out the following lines, and any lines resembling them: "i don't know what we are anymore." "i don't want to lose you." "he's just like the rest of them!" (and its corollary, "daddy, you don't even know him!") 7. yes, yes, she's in heaven, running around in a field. we get it.8. and in other news, we get it.i have seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; i never expected to suffer for your art, and i would have just left the theater, but an elephant with the words "doomed love" painted on its side fell from the sky and pinned me to my seat.in closing, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars, and i hate you.

hair, the movie based on the broadway hit,fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities. you cant really take the play and make it a movie. whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie, it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show. worse than seeing sitcom reruns. musical fiasco, and cant believe others rated it so high.

**** possible spoiler **** if you were making a serious movie involving a powerful, but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters, featuring actors of the highest caliber, with great cinematography and a beautiful midwestern setting, now where would you go with it? why, you'd fashion a modern tragedy after "king lear" of course.that's what i was expecting. that certainly wasn't what i got. what i got was 105 minutes of feminist tripe--one long harangue about man's inhumanity to woman. why, there wasn't a decent male in the entire story.you see early on where this film might be headed, but you can't believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and craftsmen on that trite scenario--you just want them to get on with the king lear theme. but it never happens; and there's the real tragedy if you ask me.aside from the panorama of glorious rural heartland, about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful chameleon, british actor colin firth, practicing his midwestern accent. now there was a treat.3/10

the story is derived from "king lear"; the setting is a farm in iowa. here's a test for this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking, "why did so-and-so do such-and-such," and the answer is, "because that's what happened in 'king lear'," you know that the film has failed. well, that is what happens here. the father figure in this story isn't living his own life, he's mimicking a fictional one. but there's more wrong with the film than this.jocelyn moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than i think she realises. she's trying to take the king lear story and completely change the setting. this is a task in itself. the likeliest result is that the transplanted story will die, and nobody will quite be able to work out why (although there are enough successful transplants, like "west side story", to make it worth trying). but she's also attempting a revisionist retelling. in the version of "king lear" she wishes to create, reagan and goneril command our sympathy, and cordelia is a villain. this is a task in itself, too.succeeding at either task is hard; succeeding at both at once is impossible. in fact, succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other, is impossible. if we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must be the very same events - which means there can be no tampering with setting. if the story is to be transplanted, alive, into a different setting, its moral heart must keep beating the whole while - which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective. moorhouse was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours. and so she did. ...naturally, it's possible to attempt both tasks, fail at both tasks, yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art that's good for independent reasons. i mention this because i haven't read jane smiley's novel, which, for all i know, is good for independent reasons. but the film isn't. if there was nothing else wrong with it, there would still be no getting around the fact that it's just so thoroughly, excruciatingly dull. the very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life - which needn't be the case, since off the top of my head i can think of four films ("the wizard of oz", "north by northwest", "the straight story", "kikujiro") in which the cornfields aren't boring at all.

this movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. there are some good performances, but the subplots are extraneous and largely unresolved.in addition, i found all the characters unlikeable, and if you can't identify with at least one character, there isn't much to get excited about. all in all, this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.

sadly a great opportunity to utilise a superb cast to bring king lear up to date. however, instead, we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into lear when the writer had run out of ideas, the cast worked hard but it just didn't gel. recently stephen harrigan showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie "king of texas".

it's probably a cultural thing---somehow, the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny. i have experienced this phenomenon first-hand, during an open-air cinema event, where this film was shown before the feature. most of the indigenous audience laughed, and no, this wasn't in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children, this was in a well-to-do area, and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults.so it must be possible, somehow, to find this amusing, but honest to goodness, i have no idea what it takes---maybe it's in the air or the water, prolonged exposure to which causes this condition. something must cause it, obviously, the only thing i can say is that i am quite sure what doesn't cause it: the movie itself.there are no jokes in it. it's brain dead, stupid, nonsensical, unfunny, lame. it's, in short, a waste of time. any tom and jerry is funnier, heck even funerals are funnier.just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the stooges' performances: it's three guys behaving, running, even talking like retarded infants, causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem, with no plot, no real purpose, and no real conclusion. it's like ugly teletubbies without the cute costumes.sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating, because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of potheads and you are the only one who hasn't smoked anything.so unless you are prepared to intoxicate yourself to make this bearable, or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny, my advice on this is: stay way. far away.

i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996. i remember i was already familiar with elijah wood's work (that's right, he made stuff before "lord of the rings"!) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant ("flipper" water guns were even circulating).adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for nostalgia's sake took their kids to see it, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy.unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and flopped severely. you know a movie's in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away, and the kid -- instead of getting out of the water into a boat -- floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there, perhaps even below him.another problem is paul hogan. he looks old, crusty and tired of recycling his croc dundee shtick. by now, no one even remembered "crocodile dundee" much less hogan, and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water/social-satire laughs.all in all this is a really poor "family" movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times. i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in '96 and i hate it more now.

my take: even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paper-thin characters. for those who haven't already got enough of the free willy pictures, flipper might serve up a decent rental. others are (heavily) suggested to stay away. although flipper is harmless affair, it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience (unless it's your first time to see a dolphin).a remake of a 1960's tv show and film, flipper may have sound like a good idea back then: a dolphin charms the life of boy and a girl, they help ave the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the sparkling waters of the florida keys, and at the same time, battle a shark and a salty sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins. but even for the 90's, especially if an eerily similar film like free willy was a recent hit, flipper is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids. although the animals (this, in case, is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, typecast as the villain) and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, there's nothing much in flipper to steal from anyway.the story is completely predictable, something than nowadays even a 6-year old may find evident. the (human) cast, led by a pre-lord of the rings elijah wood and an out-of-work paul hogan, have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty. their acting skills, whatever they may be to this movie, is rarely revealed on screen, unless you consider the "acting" talents of cheerful bottlenose dolphin. i guess not trying to recommend flipper as mindless family entertainment won't be fair, but anyone over the age of 10 (no, make that 8), are better off renting or buying something else. besides, the film is about 95 minutes tops. that might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids. that alone might be worth the rental.rating: ** out of 5.

reading the other user comments, the review by a666333 has articulated most of what i was feeling throughout this film- predictable storyline, cliché versions of lesbians/heterosexuals (i.e. straight woman becomes a lesbian while concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive). also, the score was severely disappointing. it was bland, soft, sentimental elevator music- another common cliché in movies about lesbians. the movie would have had a few interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music.a few scenes concerning sex and eroticism also struck me as attempts to titillate and raise shock value, including parts of the final performance scene. the conventional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score. for example during the pool scene, the women are kissing, and then the camera pans along the abandoned wine glass, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft crashing of waves.the only elements i liked were the costuming and arobatics. they are well-choreographed, and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes. i genuinely smiled during those, and during the last scene with the police officer. but they were not enough to balance out the negatives or make me enjoy this film.

i have not watched every jackass episode. it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going. but after watching jackass #2 i was fond of bam and dunn. they had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on viva la bam. boy was i mistaken. seriously, you could pair a bunch of 2'graders, provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen. i mean, c'mon mtv!! at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish.everything seems so forced. you don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all. you can't appreciate bam or dunn, or anyone for that matter. if there would just be a tiny tiny doze of thought. anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on.they finally manage to create a good shot and you like whats going on. you sit there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some jerk closes the scenes with two lame sentences and bang. was that the close for that shot or what, please?. if i had been there i would freak out and laugh. do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys... just scripted stupid reactions.yes they get a few chuckles of the audience by cheap gross jokes, or gigantic jokes which in my opinion are such a waste of cash. many many normal humans which was not taken under the jackass wing could in a heartbeat write a far funnier script. or impress with visual camera work. even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull of a better job. mtv could in a whim bring more soothing material on the screen. you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show.some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars.

viva la bam this "jackass" spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of bam margera and his pals (johnny knoxville, brandon dicamillo, etc). this show, while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on bam's torturing of his parents.i'm sorry to say this, bam, but... you're in no way as cool as you think you are. this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, i liked jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he's going to do "whatever the f***" he wants to. how about you do something that is actually funny? i liked "jackass" for what it was worth. the camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.not so with "viva la bam". we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile."viva la bam" is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed margera's already too big ego. i don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.

this film is an insult to the play upon which it is based. the character of claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. shame, shame, shame. they have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung. this warps the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives hud a wife,turns sheila into a spoiled rich girl, characterizes claude as a cowboy, and kills burger by sending him to vietnam instead. if one is not familiar with the original plot i assure you this is not a bad film for you to see, but if you ever wish to see the original or are, as i am, a die-hard fan of the classic play, you would do best to avoid the film altogether. one really must stick to one or the other.

bam margera of the jackass fame is back with his own reality show, and not only is it not as funny as jackass, but it's also amazingly stupider! this has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived. sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb.bam margera has made it big, and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame. bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while bam and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief, generally his parents are at home being stupid. when bam's parents aren't at home being lazy, they're being tortured by bam, especially his father. to add to the humor, we are treated to his fat uncle don vitto who is constantly out of it, and never paying attention.this show really is like a toned down version of jackass...toned down in that there aren't stunts, instead bam and his buddies just go break stuff, and do lame stunts, and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome. this is not funny in the least. i can't imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here.if you are a big fan of bam margera, and want to see one of the many follow up/cash-in sequels to the jackass series.my rating: * out of ****. 30 mins. tv14

anyone remember the first cky, cky2k etc..? back when it was about making crazy cool stuff, rather than watching bam margera act like a douchebag, spoiled 5 year old, super/rock-star wannabe.the show used to be awesome, however, bam's fame and wealth has led him to believe, that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic, more than actual cool stuff, that used to be in ex. cky2k.the acts are so repetitive, there's like nothing new, except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments... the only things we see is bam margera, so busy showing us how much he doesn't care, how much money he got or whatsoever.i really got nothing much left to say except, give us back cky2k, cause bam suck..i enjoy watching steve-o, knoxville etc. a thousand times more.

this is by far the worst and most stupid show i have ever seen on tv. it is almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties) doing nothing but torture and mock his parents, who always seem to have no clue what so ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their dimwitted son and his equally stupid friends. of course i know his parents are in on it, but i really hate how they always act like they are caught completely by surprise. it seems fake through and through. and i really hate the intro of the show, in which a voice over asks "bam margera, what will he think of next?!?!" (i think that's how it is, anyway), and bam himself answers: "whatever the f^*k i want!" - wow! bam is really a hell raiser - living at home with mum and dad! -of course the word "f^*k" is replaced with a tasteful beep, but we get the message. bam is the real deal rebel - at least in his own eyes. of course bam and his posse of numb sculls aim at an audience of teenage boys, and of course it's a mtv show, but please, raise the bar a little. it's painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.

overall i'd call this a disappointing performance. it attempts the old "horror anthology" approach, but fails miserably. the acting was bad, and so were the stories. any skin shown in the movie was obviously random, just to attract the r-rating for sex. typical, i guess, but bad nonetheless. take your $5 and rent a real movie instead!

okay, so the movie went straight to video. if i had paid to see this, i would've been disappointed. but, at 2 am in the morning, alone at night, it's a pretty good fright! (hey, that rhymes!)

i should start off by saying i have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. some of them are fantastic, some are downright crap. so i expected hair to fall into one of those categories. however, it didn't, falling instead in the middle.the songs aren't brilliant, though the "sodomy" song did make me smile a lot, and everything is rather dated looking. but the movie didn't draw me in as others have, such as rocky horror. although that's a bad example, since for years i hated rocky horror, then all of a sudden i got it and have loved it ever since. maybe hair will be the same. although i doubt it will get as much exposure as rocky horror due to the language and nudity content, so i doubt i will get the chance to have it grow on me. gettit? hair....grow...oh suit yourself.anyhow, i didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch, which was a shame, since i would have liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here.not a film for the casual cinema-goer, but definitely one for musical lovers. i really hope they don't re-make it, though, since i think any such re-make would end up a shallow, pale, pc version of the original.worth a look for lovers of the genre.

i've liked milos forman's movies since i saw "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" and "amadeus" (two big masterpieces), but when i saw "hair", i kept wondering if this was the same milos forman. this movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. ok, the music is pretty good, but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around (wait a minute... that's what it really is!). in fact, the only interesting part, and the only part where milos' talent shows up, are the last 15 minutes or so, (spoiler!!) since when berger takes claude's place as a soldier set to the vietnam war. that 15 minutes are moving and well-directed, but it's a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before that.well, maybe this is one of those movies you need to be "on the subject" to enjoy (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs the film glorifies). i'm not, so...

i was a hippie age 22 in 1965, have seen the play 5 times, have 2 versions of the music, and have read the script many times. maybe taken as an separate thing, the movie is ok, but as an adoption of the play, it's terrible.first the good. the songs are sung well, and the production values are pretty good. the homosexual implications in black boys, white boys is cute. the claude/berger switch was interesting. hair is a fluid production, and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained.but the basic spirit was very much distorted. it seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs, and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play.claude, sheila, and hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. claude destroyed sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt), and repeatedly stole cars. sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly, probably be busted in rank, and could likely die on that lonely nevada road. good fun. and hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. this is not what hippies were like, not what the play described, and is directly opposite to a love generation.i've never seen a hippie beg for money. the point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not beg from it.after berger is thrown in jail for ruining sheila's party and claude offers to bail some out, berger insists on being bailed instead, with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on sheila's parents, and then hitting on his own mommy."be in" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. even if this is part of his trip, it ruins a beautiful song. i know they're contrasting "floating in space" with the army. but again, it totally ruins a beautiful song.while sheila and claude are skinny dipping, berger steals their clothes, laughing "it was fun man" even after he could see both were very annoyed. then a little later, berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. he hits claude. terrible.then they have the perfect opportunity to sing "starshine" at night in some beautiful sf spot with the stars twinkling down, maybe working into an inventive duet. instead, the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course).i was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979, and i like it even less now. i think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show, but this ain't it.

when a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair), i argued that i could grow; orson welles' first movie, indeed, was even worse. he challenged me that it couldn't be, so i pulled out the criterion laserdisc of (i think) citizen kane and played hearts of age. my friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point.there is a little humor in this short, but it's basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) blood of a poet and other avant garde films of the time. it is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme, and unless you really enjoy any footage of welles (in heavy makeup, to boot), this isn't really even worth tracking down.

just watched on ubuweb this early experimental short film directed by william vance and orson welles. yes, you read that right, orson welles! years before he gained fame for radio's "the war of the worlds" and his feature debut citizen kane, welles was a 19-year-old just finding his muse. besides vance and welles, another player here was one virginia nicholson, who would become orson's first wife. she plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an african-american servant (paul edgerton in blackface). during this time a man (welles) keeps passing her by (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating). i won't reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump-cut constantly. that's not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score (by larry morotta) added in the 2005 print i watched. worth a look for welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde.

a mean spirited, repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children. susan strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo, even though she receives star billing. if your a julie brown fan, you'll want to check it out, since she's naked in a couple of shots. all others,avoid.

i was at wrestlemania vi in toronto as a 10 year old, and the event i saw then was pretty different from what i saw on the wrestlemania collection dvd i just watched. i don't understand how the wwe doesn't have the rights to some of the old music, since most of those songs were created by the wwf they shouldn't have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like snl from releasing season sets. its pretty stupid to whine about, but for me hearing demolition come out to their theme music at a wrestlemania in person was a memory that i never forgot, and it didn't exist on this dvd. what is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?

hmmm! is it worst film ever? well sort of, for some of the cast its a shame to see them in such a film but hey if it pays the bills why not, as for the film well. ok cg effects not to bad for such a cheap film ,music is just about ok again for a cheap film, end credits are ok lolbad to many to list but, cast, acting, sets, script, ending..what the hell ,drac..........worst drac ever!, many more but can not be bothered to put them all down.idea was ok but needed ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all bad points, i do say however to see this film so you to can say"what the fu%$ was that all about"as the credits run.also its kind of a must see just to see how bad it is.

this movie, despite its list of b, c, and d list celebs, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. the plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. it was so silly that i cannot believe that i am taking the time to even write a review of it. flex, to his credit, has grown in his ability to act since playing michael jackson in a made for tv movie a few years ago. tangi, on the other hand, has regressed, as she was more talented in her role as felicity's flunkie some years ago. as i sat watching this train wreck of a film, with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality, other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what i thought of this film. however, in an effort to keep my writings g rated, i'll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an l. lame!!!

my original comment on this particular title was deleted, by a imdb user or the staff, only because i just happen to dislike this film to the point i had to sincerely write what i felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film. where's my freedom of word?obviously this movie was made by students, 'cos so lame and amateurish it felt. of course even they have to start from somewhere? the script was incoherent mess and so was the acting. with low budget and b- class actors, what can you expect? there's some cgi in places, so poor, it looks like done with an old pc. some may say, this is sort of an "alien" clone, only this time it's dracula (in a vintage costume) who's sucking the other cast dry, one by one. the sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large space craft. it would be fun to know what the stars (erika eleniak, casper van dien, coolio and udo kier) thought about the film after it was released... coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever!it was a total waste of my time and money, don't know why i even bothered to rent this flick. honestly, i just hate this film. with uwe boll's house of the dead, dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever. (well, i've seen even worse than these two)avoid! any other film will do better.

...and that's a goddamn shame! please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of dracula 3000. this must be the worst vampire-flick of the new millennium so far (i haven't seen reign in darkness yet, but they don't get much worse than this). don't be fooled be the movie's cool h.r. gigeresque cover. this is so bad, it's almost hilarious. i can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured. i laughed my ass off, i yelled at the screen, i sat there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... this film has 'cheap & cheese' written all over it. the best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay cgi of two space-ships. but when casper van dien's voice-over comes on, you start smelling something fishy. and, indeed, it all goes downhill rapidly after that.the crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel, the demeter, which seems to be heading for earth. they enter it, thus sealing their fate. this movie is, above all things, a shameless low-budget alien-rip-off, mixed with vampires. right down to the plot-twist were erika eleniak's character, aurora, reveals she's a robot. coolio goes badly over-the-top as the dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). casper van dien's character's named capt. van helsing (hahaha!) and he looks like...,er well, casper van dien. udo kier as capt. varna, former commander of the demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor udo, what where you doing in this flick?). and then we have langley kirkwood as count orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. just look at his outfit. instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he's wearing a cheap old-school halloween-suit with fringes. you thought richard roxburgh was unconvincing as dracula in van helsing? then wait until you see langley's performance!the set-designers went overboard on this one. the interior of the demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. the prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and "prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. it has to be pushed around in order to move.aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. and the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: humvee and aurora are the only survivors. instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. then aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a "protheus 3.2 pb", in other words: a pleasure-bot. so she says "well then, what are you waiting for". humvee answers "ain't gotta tell me twice. come on, girl", picks her up and... "boooooom!!!" the ship explodes and credits roll. no sex-scene, no erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... just one more shot of udo kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.so, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but i must warn them: it gets really painful at times. and everyone claiming that van helsing, underworld or even queen of the damned is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn't seen dracula 3000 yet.

oh dear gods, this is awful. stay away, just stay away. if you think you've seen bad movies, think again. never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie. the acting, if it is allowed to be called that, is enough to cause internal bleedings inside your head. the story is so thin it is just barely there... no wait, scratch that. there is not a complete story there, but once in a while, there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness, and believe me, those few lines should have been shot. the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it, and watch the cozy fire from a distance.some may call me sarcastic in this review, but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache. however, should you be, what i like to call, a visual masochist (like myself), please, go right ahead and watch this monstrosity.

imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect. now imagine something infinitely darker - i mean, worse, than that. then multiply that by the quantity of the suckiness possessed by the star wars holiday special. this movie is by far worse than that."dracula 3000: infinite darkness", starring such illustrious and reputable actors such as coolio and langley kirkwood (as the film's "horrifying antagonist", count orlock) is equatable to eating one's own feces exclusively for one's entire life, condensed into approximately one hour and twenty minutes. to be frank, there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy - riddled with communist propaganda, promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms, and quite possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "war of the worlds".the hammer and the sickle of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the dingy sets they dare call a spaceship. lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the "film". and of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries by then. so they don't know who this "god" is, even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain. but of course, in the socialist republic of space (presided over by interstellar president baker), death-stick like drugs are legalized and quite common. yet handicap mobility seems even worse off than it is today (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp).racial tension still festers throughout the galaxy in quite a familiar/predictable fashion. we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as "is dracula a brotha?", "us brothas gotta stick together", and "once you go black, you don't go back." speaking of the token black characters, one is played by coolio. playing a stereotypical stoner, coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. oh wait, second most ridiculous vampire ever. that prized title goes to our friend count orlock, from planet transylvania, in the carpathian system. these two make quite a pair, between coolio's attempts to cripple a paraplegic, strange attempts at making high-pitched animal noises, a hairstyle 1004 years old, and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue; and count orlock's twenty dollar generic halloween-style vampire costume, exploding coffins, or confusingly inane back story.one wonders if they did not simply give coolio the opportunity to get "as high as a kite in space without gravity", let him interact with the other "actors", and just went from there.count orlock's motivations are also somewhat in question. does he want "infinite darkness", as the film's subtitle would have you believe? does he want to eat the crew? or does he want *coolio* to "kill them all"? or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an inhospitably future? it doesn't really matter, because none of this film's plot makes sense anyways.the highlight of this movie has to be it's ending. more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt trainwreck of a climax they phone in before the credits. instead of facing count orlock off in some sort of duel (the closest we get is a shot of orlock flailing around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist, who dies shortly afterwards), our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door. orlock then proceeds to collapse, screeching in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury. this is by far the most fun you'll get from this movie. watching a vampire's contorted face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat - with laughter. almost worth the four bucks for that alone. of course, right after that we're treated with one of the film's worst one-liners, the mandatory allusion to sex, and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending *ever*. they're driving into the sun, and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact. i think they just outdid the wachowski bros. for the worst finale ever.i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible. secure in this fact, we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created, and one which will never be exceeded in low quality, lower budget, and lower-est acting talent.

dracula 3000 or van helsing "dracula's revenge" (cheap cash in on another lame vampire flick) as i saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie. a rag tag collection of misfit salvager's board a previously lost cargo ship "the demeter" in the (cough) carpathian system (which later is upgraded to the carpathian galaxy) and awake a relentless evil (in this case the script). the film is a bizarre bastardization of event horizon and whatever the lamest vampire film of all time is.****spoliers follow**** after a plethora of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on, we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from casper (silly name) who plays captain abraham van helsing (sillier name) and in lieu of actual character development, goes on to describe the twisted, unintelligible oddities that make up his crew. van helsing himself sports a spray on stubble and wears a body warmer throughout in a sort of retro 80's tribute to han solo (i guess). now and again the captain of the demeter pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a pronounced german accent (subtitles sadly not included). crewmember mina boards the derelict ship (alone???) armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east-european accent while conversing with van helsing on his ships bridge (which is basically a single glittery wall). mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak who continually glides by the camera. why this happens as the vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. this leads on to a shaky camera chasing mina down the hallways until she runs into humvee. it's possible will smith could have been drafted in to write humvee's lines as most of them consist of humvee reminding us he is black every ten seconds and saying the word "ass" enough for a guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a "from da hood" accent (this is the year 3000, does "da hood" even exist?) one of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year 3000. unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this, as the demeter looks suspiciously like a soviet style ocean going tanker. possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of lenin next to a bunch of lockers and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special. the crew's clothes look as if they were raided from a oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and they are armed to the teeth with latest in 20th century automatic weapons (with added year 3000 zing when fired) which of course are absolutely no use against vampires. healthcare is a thing of the past (in the future) as the simpering professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair??? my god what happened to all that genetic engineering stuff.the professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip off from alien resurrection who had their own rag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who oddly wasn't killed). fans didn't take to prof as he appears scared in a lot of scenes if i were entombed in a non-wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me because i was such a whining wimp, i'd be scared too.during the un-dramatic mina chase scene the prof informs us (with feeling) "this is disconcerting". the rest of his lines are also disconcerting "bugger", and "we're all going to die" x 100, follows.erika eleniak appears as the vice captain (what happened to 1st officers?) in what i thought would be the tired, standard issue, hard nosed, no nonsense, "don't eye me up unless i tell you too", beat up 10 stuntman at one time super-babe, but this is a z-flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even tighter leather trousers. coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by 90% and is camper than a row of tents but luckily for us he dies soon enough. although he seems to keep his heart on the right hand side of his body.after a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using clunky soviet style controls, and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship buggers off to find a more interesting crew (probably). why dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called orlock which is space transylvanian for "crimes against fashion" as he dandies about in a big puffy, frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making hammer horror vampires look slick by comparison. orlock stops to explain his entire back story (off camera) to erica eleniak, but fails to kill her in another rip-off twist from alien resurrection. his back story is such a load of mince it's not worth repeating. as the budget can't afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even proper end titles (the first cast list i saw, were same characters but completely different and italian names) the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with. the crew luckily are able to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure, millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room (up yours "holodeck"). the ending is awful and a little suspect, either they ran out of money or the ex-soviets demanded their ship back. i walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was.

greetings from lithuania.this is the first question that comes to head after watching this "movie". you know, i saw a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching this one, i only had two questions: 1) is this was just a parody (spoof) 2) how could people create such a thing!? if you never saw this "film", than you really don't know what is a really bad "film". i mean bad. the script - are you kidding my? acting is so horrible that i thing "the actors" where just having fun in this movie. i know, this is "b" movie, but come on?? is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage?? oh! and what an ending!!! a must miss ending! just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw, wait until the ending - because that kind of ending you have never saw before (and i hope you will never see). awoid this "movie" at any cost, and don't say i didn't warn you...

a space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space. the crew investigates, hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship. however, once aboard the ominous vessel, their own ship mysteriously disengages, leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or orloff as this creature calls himself.not a bad start. i mean it follows any number of typical sci-fi/horror plots. the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film. but, when you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the legend of dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever they're forced to confront, the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples.director darrell roodt, who also wrote dracula 3000 with ivan milborrow, is primarily responsible for this utter failure. so, no, roodt and milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their arms.this film begins ominously enough, with a very poorly delivered voice over by caspar van dien, essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are. i should also point out that van dien's character is named van helsing. and, oh so very cleverly, this orloff character is from planet transylvania in the carpathian system. no kidding. i mean, come on guys, we get it. and, again, don't be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store.so, after van helsing's introduction of the crew, we have, essentially, a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about.i'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. occasionally, they can be brilliant, see raimi's first two evil dead films. dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers like, van dien, erika eleniak, coolio, etc. however, unlike, the evil dead flicks, there is no talent behind the camera. in front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt. it really seems like they don't know what to do. the best actor of the bunch, alexandra kamp-groenveld, gets killed off quickly and the ever-enjoyable udo kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal. grant swandby is also okay as the professor, but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair. and, yes, it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it. as for the rest of the actors, well.i'm sure coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire, but, well, i don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book. tiny lister and erika eleniak don't really provide much either. lister is never really more then the il' big brawny black stereotype. eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard. eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid thirties, but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movie's duration.this brings us to count dracula/orloff played by langley kirkwood. to be honest, i can't recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be. he introduces himself as orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as count dracula as well. go figure. in any case, you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is. have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots? yes, it's that bad. langley kirkwood, the actor playing orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. i'm sure he's still getting hassled by his friends.there isn't much to the plot. the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth, for some reason, and also, there is some lip service about wanting to defeat caspar van dien's character, van helsing. most of the crew get turned into vampires, including van helsing, and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine. yeah, that's right, bullets, and yes, the year 3000. keeping in that baffling vein, one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires, or vampire, since there is really never more then one threatening them, is filled with old soviet posters and insignia and such. what the? there are also references to god/religion being antiquated systems. but these references only confused me. did the soviet union make a comeback? is there some point roodt and milborrow want to make with this? it never really goes anywhere, seems dumb and the posters, etc. just look cheap.on the positive side, the film is competently shot and edited. the cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it's clearly done by professionals and, i had no problem with the special effects. the ships look like ships in outer space. although, as i write this, i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him. what were they thinking? why didn't someone say something? see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives? i guess, ultimately, that's the thing. whatever positives you try and grant this sci-fi/horror debacle, you become overwhelmed by it's lack of quality.poor udo kier.

this movie has been promoting in everywhere in spain with a huge publicity campaign, after watching it, you realise that someone has stolen your money. paz vega is horrible as carmen, she´s not natural at all and she looks like she´s making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots ("the best" is when she as an andalusian woman ...¡can speak basque and fluently¡, leonardo sbaraglia is much better than her as jose, but the story is very slow, the plot don´t work, and the screenplay is really very very bad...i think penelope cruz (the film was written for her)would have been a much more credible and sexy carmen.what a waste of time and money

when i saw this in the cinema, i remember wincing at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene, then immediately telling myself "no, this has to get better". it didn't. the performances are pretty uniformly teak 'n pine and no, there is no sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever, just the awkward posturings of a reasonably comely, discreetly talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of "interviú" and not much else besides. if the scriptwriter thought that making mérimée a character was a stunningly original creative ploy he perhaps ought to get out more. and aranda, if he'd given the matter a bit more thought, would have realised that the story of carmen is just crying out for a thoughtful, iconoclastic, parodic deconstruction, not this leave-your-brains-at-the-turnstile affair of ersatz passion and comic-book dialogue. this is contemporary spanish cinema at its worst.

carmen is a prostitute that lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the spanish army; she is, without any doubt, the best femme fatale at the moment. when a man resist her charming attentions, she decides to do everything to destroy him. at the end, he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with carmen. despite paz vega is very beautiful, she doesn't seem a gypsy (as carmen is) and neither her acting nor sbaraglia's are good. the story results very boring, and, in most moments, it is very absurd, while intending to appear truthful. in the same way are the scenarios and the special effects, despite not being but they are not but acceptable, and too much artificial for a historic film as it is. to sum up, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are much betters thing to watch.

before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not, i should inform you i've never seen another adaptation of carmen, so if you're looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others, this might not be of much use to you.the only time i've come across carmen was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager. i didn't pay much attention to it because i didn't like opera at the time and i didn't know any better. the story has been around for 150 years or so. do i feel i've missed out after seeing this movie? yes, mainly due to the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega, i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collection.directed by vicente aranda (who also co-rewrote the story with joaquim jordà), the story is told through the eyes of the original author prosper mérimée, a french writer making his way through 19th century spain. he comes across josé (leonardo sbaraglia), a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen (paz vega), a sultry, sexy, bedazzling gypsy woman, who has the mouth of the devil, the temper of a 'toro' and who recklessly leads men to their doom. the moment she meets josé, she is attracted by his stand-offish behaviour. but she hooks him, reels him in and lets him go, many-a-time. until one day, josé is wanted for murder. carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers. they seem to be settling, she's fallen in love with him, but she meets the charming escamillo, the bullfighter. can josé hold his jealousy in check, or does it destroy him? it's a beautiful,seductive story, something that resembles, almost, a shakespearian or ovid plot, with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character. it's poetic, fiery, and above all, slutty. i was left hanging on, i didn't know which way it was going to turn. i always hoped that josé might change carmen's dirty little ways. i won't tell you if he succeeded or not.the above synopsis is what i took away from the film, but i was not impressed by the film itself. it was only after i watched it that i dug a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity aranda had made of retelling mérimée's classic. it was a shallow, slutty period-drama blunder, that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked (not that i'm complaining about this in particular!).first of all, the acting was poor. i was not impressed by sbaraglia as josé. i'm still unsure whether he was a weak actor or josé was supposed to be a weak character, i've not read the book. he's supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen, but he spends much of the time looking confused, jealous and a bit dim. paz vega was slightly better as carmen. i was convinced by her hardened, wicked character, although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films, such as zapping and lucia y el sexo. she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman (not that i've come across many andalusian gypsy women), so in a way, the role didn't really fit her. the other actors in the film weren't great either. they seemed to do everything half-heartedly. the story is passionate, emotive  they looked half-arsed, as if they couldn't wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearing.however, the costumes, i was impressed with - one of the redeeming factors of the film. i like spanish culture, i liked the soldiers' uniforms, the top-hats and the women's flamenco dresses. they fitted the time well. that's all i can really say about that. sorry, back to the criticism.the script, as stated above, was co-rewritten by vicente aranda and joaquim jordà, and done so badly, so much that it would leave mérimée turning in his grave. it was boring. it didn't make best use of josé's intense passion for carmen (or maybe that was just the acting). there were cheesy lines piled upon one and other, satan and devil connotations everywhere, amongst the millions of swear words. i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word, but the film was littered with puta, 'whore', in literally every line maybe it was realistic in 19th century poverty-stricken seville, but the story itself didn't need it.the editing and camera work was dull and ordinary. there was only one bit i actually liked, and that was when the camera follows a fly close-up in mid-air, which lands on carmen's face. that was good. but the rest? boring.to conclude, it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing. if you're a literature teacher, by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story. however, only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film, thanks to paz vega. otherwise, stick to the opera version (even though i hate musicals). i give this film 4, just for the fact i love the storyline! and paz vega!

this 2.5 hour diluted snore-fest appears to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation, ever. clearly possessing a budget allowing for breathtaking location shooting in greece, the monies might have been better spent working out a cohesive script with character development and motivations clearly outlined; especially since bill has gone through the trouble of doing this already. the portrayals lacked passion & direction, leaving the viewer debating whether they should bother to care about the demise of the protagonists at all. which brings out another point-the main character of the original work, prospero, is not so named in this rendition despite the fact that most other characters' names are used. enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece. in fact, all aspects that made the stage version of 'the tempest' full of wonder and intrigue have been sucked completely from this convoluted version about a self-absorbed, pompous arse who can't figure out how to care about anything beyond the blur of his wealth and power. over all, a lackluster effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration.

tempest is based on the classic shakespearean work of the same name, but bears little resemblance to its source material.it masquerades as being as cerebral as its namesake, but instead is a jumbled, convoluted, and hackneyed exercise in tedium. the original probed the premise that people have an evil side, which would be destructive if unchecked. here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis (yawn) goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life. he becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment; in other words: to get his own way.every few minutes, after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong, he finds a secluded place and starts babbling "show me the magic!" while waving his hands around and making a "serious concentration" expression. from the way these scenes are shot, it looks like he's trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs. turning a spider into a cockroach, maybe, but by this time, you really don't care.the story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a greek island somewhere, then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets, one of the dullest romances ever committed to film. the story just bogs down and moves at a slower and slower pace. you are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone.i'll give this a 2 because of the beautiful greek location shots and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it isn't clear if the tempest power brought this ending about or not). the spirit of shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other movies; one notable example is "forbidden planet," which gave credence to how the power gets out of control.as for this "tempest", its only magic is to cure insomnia.

paul mazursky misfires on this film. the writing, direction, casting, and acting (with the exception of victorio gassman) are all off the mark. i remember the reviews from 20+ years ago being mediocre, but i thought it still might be worthwhile to view. with notables such as susan sarandon, raul julia (who overacts in most of his scenes) and john cassavetes, i understandably expected much more. the music picked for the film is jarring, the cuts between new york and greece confusing, and the overall pace all leave much to be desired. why paul mazursky felt the need to update this story, or add his touch to it is puzzling - this retelling of prospero and his daughter takes very little of import from the play, and adds not much more. the play is not one of shakespeare's best anyway, and to gut it even further seems not to be a good decision. unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this film.

the greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that's about the extent of my raves for this movie. i found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in the american culture and were shallow and uninteresting. susan sarandon and gena rowlands are easy to look at but i found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons. when gena rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage. i was tempted to hit the mute button until she finished singing. molly ringwald was herself and raul julia's character was so lecherous he was downright creepy. the movie was much too long for my liking and i could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun.

watchable but pretty terrible. how shocking that this was the great gregory la cava's last directing credit! even in his better known roles, i don't care for gene kelly. he seems to me to be smug, hostile, and self-involved. here, paired with a minor actress like marie wilson, he seems to show those characteristics in spades.marie wilson, playing an heiress who falls for a military man, is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic. the actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard, disagreeable core of the picture and they do ok.the know-it-all butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits for which franklin pangborn was famous (and in which, despite their stereotyping, he was generally funny -- unlike this guy.) phyllis thaxter is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot.

i didn't see this movie when it originally came out, but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and i figured there must be something to the flick, so i dug it up and gave a view. now i would like the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life back(it seemed much longer). there was nothing particularly bad about the movie, the acting was good, no large plot holes, of course there wasn't much plot to have holes in. there just wasn't a lot to the movie. there was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship; nothing interesting about their story. near the end when he attempts to chase down the train to catch his fleeing romance, neither my wife nor i wanted him to catch her. honestly we figured they were better off with out each other and if they did get back together we really didn't care. so what's that say about this love story when even a 25 year old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship. i should have left this one in the "missed" category.logan lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/lingeringpoets.html

i saw this movie over 20 years ago and had rather fond memories of it. catching again on cinemax this month, i realized how little discernment i had about films back then. this is an utterly ordinary spaghetti western, with absolutely nothing noteworthy about it. script, direction, acting, photography are all a big blah. stick with the sergio leone westerns!

this spaghetti western uses three american lead actors which takes away a little of the typical spaghetti aura. the plot is about an amnesty that the governor of new mexico gives to all willing criminals to provide them a chance to start a new life. usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events but in this film it seems more like a licence to kill because even new crimes (like e.g. threatening the governor) are forgiven. the story is an endless chain of killings where nearly every character has only the purpose to deliver more carcasses. only the few leads have stamina. clay mccord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where unsurprisingly he killed a lot of people. in the middle of the everlasting mayhem this kind of reflections lack credibility. compared with similar films like e.g. bandidos none of the characters in this film was likable for me.apart of the weak content which targets certain customers this film is well shot, sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average. 4 / 10.

just desserts was, i must say, one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable. i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies. my expectations weren't high to begin with, but it turned out to be cornier than i expected. i thought it might not be all that bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition--the golden whisk--came up i began changing my mind. it all went downhill from there. the only thing i did like about this movie, other than snickering at it's absurd plot and dialogue, was watching them cook. however, being a movie about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything. i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie. you get to see more food being prepared, and you dodge the pathetic one-liners. however, if you enjoy corny love stories, which is sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.

this film is bad, yes, but had the producers used a real kangaroo, it would have killed the actor it was boxing with. i am an australian and i have seen two seven foot tall male 'roos fighting each other, it is not a pretty sight as the object is for one or the other to kill it's opponent,(this is there way of securing the herd of females) and there are incidents where someone has boxed a kangaroo, and been injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on tv or film it is likely to be a female, or animated, as it is a good idea not to injure actors (they might be annoyed at losing the ability to breath). there is a strange idea that australian animals are cute and cuddly, that is false, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 most deadliest snakes live here)and most are just plain ugly (koalas are as soft as steal wool). so if you come to australia be carefull!!!

i picked this dvd up for 3.99 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free. i never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the dvd player. the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy. the acting is really cheesy in some parts, and the "action" scenes are completely laughable. you'll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained. the plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to los angeles, there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot, not that there really is a plot at all.don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes.as for the dvd, there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film, a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train, and the deleted scenes are really pointless, if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad. there is also a really bad making of featurette which doesn't really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots. i can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends. i give it 2 kitty cats out of 5.

last week on friday, i went to see "snakes on a plane" with my friends. it was amazing compared to this horrible film (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). basically, some woman has a mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside of they're victims. the girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot. on the title screen it says "100 passengers... 3,000 venemous vipers!" scary, i know. there weren't even 100 passengers on the train. only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers. it's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge cg snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though. it's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap film, only to make a few bucks because of the "snakes on a plane" craze.

this train-wreck begins with brujo and alma crossing the mexican border. alma is suffering from some horrid curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and nickelodeon gac every few minutes as well as clench her teeth and mutter nonsense. so apparently alma has this uncle in los angeles who knows of a cure for her. they hop aboard a train to get there and luckily a friend of theirs pays their way. alma and brujo stay in the luggage cart the whole movie since they can't afford upper class seats. meanwhile in the higher class we see a bunch of nobodies on their way to la for whatever reasons. a balding guy on a business trip, two girls, one of whom is carrying $5 grand and a wad of cocaine, three stoners, and some mexicans. the mexicans rough it up with brujo and try to take his "weed" which apparently is a sedative for alma's snakes slithering inside her. they realize that the snakes don't attack, they enter your body through your veins! very twisted and b-movie. brujo saves the guy by ripping out his heart (temple of doom style) and procuring the snake. for some reason he cannot have the snakes harmed or it'll hurt alma. while this is going on a narcotics expert tries to bust one of the girls and gets a little action (topless) in exchange for not telling about her shipment of drugs. a mystery guy shows up and has a gunfight with him. as a grand finale alma turns into a vampire, bites her man and then becomes a giant pathetic excuse for a cg snake the size of the train, eats the train and is blasted into a nuclear bomb hurricane whirlwind and disappears. everyone then heads to la on foot.the credits actually say at the end "any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental, and very weird. we suggest moving and/or taking a plane". odd since a line in the movie from the bald guy is "yeah, i hate planes!" the credits go on to say "no snakes were hurt during the production of this screenplay. only a small child but it's cool." there actually were a lot of real snakes used in the movie, and all of them very tame. there is actually no scene of cg snakes attacking anyone unless you count the large one, but then it just eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and it looks like a muppet. the snakes don't really attack anything, they're just...there. one crawls out of toilet paper actually!the movie isn't funny, isn't scary (as there's no real snake attack), and is just a 'quickie cash-in' which is when a low-budget movie company hears about a big budget hollywood release, then they rush to put out a similar film, or even a parodic version, for release just prior to, or simultaneously with, the big name flick. the effect of this being that many people will either confuse one for the other, and go see the quickie rather than the 'biggie' or, they will want to see both, for whatever reason... like myself. avoid at all costs.

"shut the front door" that's what i said when i was told that blockbuster got a new movie in called snakes on a train. okay, maybe that's not exactly what i said, but you get the point. i didn't need to know who was in the movie, or anything else. all i knew was that i am renting this movie.i probably should have asked what it was about though. in retrospect, i don't know if i would have really wanted to watch a movie about a mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth. nor would i want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a pedophilic version of leif garrett.anyways, while the curse might be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least, killed by snakes. so i was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a texas ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine, or the hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people. but then, all hell broke loose, and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes.*spoiler alert* so everything's going well at the end, and i'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long. after all, people are getting eaten, so it's all good. but then all of the sudden, and i'm not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train, with all the graphic artistry of serpentaur from the old gi joe cartoons. unfortunately, i could not make a nemesis enforcer connection with this movie. anyways, so you would think that a snake that big, who ate a train, would be pretty unstoppable. well not if you know your mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. yeah, that's all i'll say about that.in short, this movie is bad. really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this, or your brain might hurt. i didn't give this a one, because no matter how stupid it was, it still wasn't as bad as date movie. so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies, this is the one for you. if you think this will actually be cool like its bigger, more infamous brethren, just walk away from the box if you see it. and i'll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up."snakes can't get on a train!" because that's just silly. not like they make stops or anything....

i can't believe that anyone would green light this let alone voluntarily star in it. i will never be able to get that 90 mins of my life back.this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. some films are so bad they're good. this has gone so far round again that's somehow it's so bad it's terrible. i was not exactly expecting much, it being a low budget, bandwagon jumping, rehash of a b movie, but it still came in way under my expectation levels. even tv movies have higher production values.there were (very) poor special effects, shocking dialogue, terrible acting and a completely unexplained plot. who cursed her and why, why did the 6 inch snakes turn into 15 foot snakes, has anyone ever heard of highly venomous garter snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? so many promises, none delivered. some comments would have you believe that this film is worth watching for the last five minutes. it's not even worth a rental. stay in and watch a low budget tv movie, you'll enjoy it a lot more. why was this made? oh yes, to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is soap. shame on you mallachi brothers, shame on you

not to be mistaken as the highly touted samuel l. jackson vehicle snakes on a plane; snakes on a train is low budget, features no actors(to speak of), but some pretty decent visual effects. an attractive young woman(julia "rayanne" ruiz)does not want to marry someonelse's choice for her husband; so she is put under a powerful mayan curse that has snakes hatching inside her body, slowly devouring from the inside out. her only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in texas. time is running out for her; and she is put on a train from el paso to los angeles. before long the snakes are leaving her pain wrecked body and rapidly growing in size. the passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be snacks for the snakes. the finale sequence is no doubt the best of this 91 minute flick. also receiving acting credit are: alby castro, al galvez and giovanni bejarno.

snakes on a train (2006, dir. the mallachi brothers) a zombie curse is placed upon a woman, which causes her to have living snakes inside her. brujo, who is looking after her, attempts to take her to los angeles on the train. after several confrontations on the train, brujo's collection of snakes manage to separate themselves from their owner and go on the hunt. whilst all this is happening, normal, everyday passengers are relaxing, what is unknown to them is that something deadly is heading their way, and that their is no were out.after watching the wonderfully fun 'snakes on a plane', i had to check this out. i knew it was going to be a rip-off and that the film will look cheap, but what i found was worst to watch. the whole curse plot was silly and should never have been included. the special effects aren't terrible but are not the best looking. i did not have a clue about the ending. it was silly to watch and pathetic. the acting was absolutely terrible, and looked bad. they just could not act to save their lives. if you want a great laugh, watch this, otherwise you should really avoid this."we have a runaway train. i repeat. we have a runaway train." - conductor (stephen a.f. day)

bloody birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end. i found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget. i don't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly. way too over-saturated. maybe this is a bad transfer to dvd or maybe it always looked like that, i don't know. there really are no redeeming qualities to speak of. there are a few deaths but not really gory. i wouldn't bother with it if i was you. the best thing about the dvd was the 15 minute interview with producer max rosenberg who was very amusing and honest. he didn't have anything good to say about director ed hunt and admits the movie was a failure, but he would like to re-make it as he believes it has a decent plot. however, he died in 2004 so i guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge. with the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldn't surprise me, there's at least one re-make per week at the cinema these day. it couldn't be any worse than the original i suppose but i couldn't care less whether it got re-made or not.

i would probably want to give this movie a zero if not for the climax, which involves not really snakes on a train, but rather train in a snake. the premise was cooked up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about snakes on a plane in production (this, in fact, was released to coincide with that film's release). the joke is probably not lost on those who will seek this out; i don't think there would be a soul out there who would consider this anything as a serious action-thriller effort (unless on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought). it's about a mayan curse placed on a woman who's damned by her family for leaving with another man, and is soon seen sickened and coughing up green slime laced with, of course, snakes. she and her beau go on a train headed for los angeles, and very soon after the more-than-cliché characters are privy to snakes overtaking the train- with the originator woman becoming a snake herself. if it would be worth listing more about the movie i would, but there isn't enough time during the day. all that can be said for the quality factor is that it's almost on-existent; there are student short films with larger budgets. maybe that was a wise calculation on the filmmakers' end, that there would be so many copies sold, just for the joke factor alone, that they would re-coup their budget in the first weekend. because by looking at the sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene!), the actors (if you can call them that, with only one other actor- the one with the very thin hair who hits on the one woman throughout the movie- who benefited from the flick being produced), the fx (also next to non-existent, making the effects in snakes on a plane seem like star wars), and the actual cgi snakes themselves, with the final huge behemoth snake something to behold in sci-fi movie channel terms.this all means, basically, that it is a laugh riot every step of the way (especially, as cruel as it sounds, when a little girl becomes involved in a snake's "attention"), with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor. this being said, it is also 100% disposable, like a b-movie sour-flavor lollipop.

truly, truly awful. i don't even know where to begin. this is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself. i'm not sure i could even assign a category myself, except that i'm quite sure it's a slap in the face of everyone, every where. even the unborn.at times, i thought i was watching a parody, or some kind of farce. at times, just a bad b movie. but i kept holding out for the porno, which, i fear, is almost(but not entirely), non existent.some one advised skipping to the ending. i would definitely second that emotion. the last five minutes are intense, and certainly contain some of the best film making/cgi you will ever see, ever.ed wood would be proud.

for their credit, this is one of their more competent pieces of trash, and that's because there's considerably good gore, and an interesting take on ripping off "snakes on a plane." but, if there's any more of example of the inconsistency behind asylum's newest rip-off it's the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can't understand nor speak english to a texas man sneaking them across the border, yet when they get on a train and meet a friend, they begin understanding and speaking perfect english.aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a hollywood formula, "snakes on a train" is utterly boring. at least, with "snakes on a plane" we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting. the mallachi brothers installment features some of the most boring characters i've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (gee, i wonder how he comes in handy later on), to some stoner surfers, right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that lurks in the husband's wife."snakes" is never entertaining, and even when it's very gory, it's still never as good as it has the chance to be, because "snakes" could have been a funny short film, and instead just takes itself much too seriously, and never camps it up at any moment. instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent, they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs. while the mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train just looks incredibly artificial.it seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars, while every so often it shakes, the background of the windows are blurred, and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know they're actually on a train; not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it. and beyond the train fight, and a drawn out sex scene, we're forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense. and not even the directors can work around the fact that the "lethal" snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerous.the rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger. all of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake (i saw better animation on the super nintendo) completely swallows the train whole, and is then dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the very beginning. asylum scores again.asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed, lazy, horribly directed, and boring rip-off of another better film. "snakes on a train" takes itself way too seriously, and that's why it's never entertaining or memorable.

seriously i thought it was a spoof when i saw it at the rental store but i realized it was just crap, i can't even believe i didn't shut it off, like we all know those snakes weren't rattlers they were pythons and gardner's, the acting was lame and oms i still cant believe the ending loll if your gonna watch it just watch it for the end it was seriously priceless way better then 6th sense, i don't even know if the makers of the movie actually thought this title would fly, the only time it is really going to fly is when i throw it in the garbage......just watch it for a laugh it was hilarious in the stupidest way, don't buy just rent.

the movie starts in mexico where a girl has been cursed, she spits on snakes thru green jello and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse. he does nothing but chant horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border get on the train to make their way to l.a. to see his uncle to lift the curse. comic hilarity ensues. this movie has the same snakes over and over! it has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. they all make the sound of rattlesnakes which makes no sense. the whole movie has some funny lines, some weak effects, but most important a great ending that leaves you like wham bam what the heck just happened!!!!! the whole movie is about a 1, but the ending is a 10, so by my crazy math it gets a 3 overall. when blockbuster has nothing else you want, grab this for mindless entertainment!

so i was energized during my snakes on a plane weekend, after the movie we craved some more. why not snakes on a train? how bad could it possibly be, its snakes probably killing people on trains. the snakes were supposed to be rattlers. first off me and my buddies thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy rattling sound clip. we actually sat through the entire thing completely ready to turn it off (we're too lazy to walk over and hit eject). next thing we knew we don't know what the heck was going on but something amazingly funny happens at the end. it's one of those endings that you'll rewind a few times just to squeeze the laughs out, because you suffered for so long. last 10 min a "8", rest of the movie a 2.

can i just start by saying i'm a fan of bad movies. and this is a really bad movie. it states on the front 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but i think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes.the snakes don't do anything particularly interesting, the whole movie in fact just blunders on with little happening. although there is occasionally a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke (bad movies have to have green goo don't they?).but then the ending comes along and will quite literally smack you off you seat in hysteria. and for that, this movie gets a boost up to a 2* rating.there are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends, just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in them.for example the arrival of 'big man' in r kelly's 'trapped in the closet' 'the line' in 'shark attack 3' (you'll know it when you hear it) the arrival of the mama shark in 'shark attack 3' almost every scene of 'troll 2' the ending of 'dracula 3000' (just for utter disbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category. it's worth sitting through just for that. so get drunk, stoned, whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some mates.quite simply, if you like bad movies, get this, but don't get it confused with 'snakes on a plane' ... there's no relation.and don't pay more than a fiver for it either ....

how on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? this is one of the most stylized pieces of rubbish i have seen in a long time. not only is it poorly written, it is a product of shoddy direction and editing. the cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage jumbled beyond belief. the actual ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are all fine to begin with but where the production/direction team takes them is a big cesspool of filth, the likes of which are seen in one episode. and this is a scientific series? i am a physician and all i can say is that the science in this film is utter crap, almost embarrassing to watch. i really felt bad for the actors involved since they were all extraordinary.

if i was british, i would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence. a protection agent of the special branch unable to defend herself against a sick, unarmed and untrained assailant? the home office sends a single "science adviser" to investigate a possible level four biohazard, and that "advisor" doesn't have the sense to wear even a mask and gloves? totally unprotected london police officers working side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits? the "advisor" and his bodyguard bearding the lair of a sociopathic doctor experimenting on human subjects without any backup? puh-leeze! one wonders whether the producers could not afford to hire any technical advisers or if, for some arcane reason, they consciously decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent. even my wife, who has no background in either medicine or law enforcement, was rolling her eyes in disbelief. after the first episode, i was discouraged; now that i have seen two episodes, i give up.

just after watching the first one and it is very dumb. i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour. the 11th hour should be embarrassed.it is so weak. stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. no mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency stuff. in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker, who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos, to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness... and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on. now thats science at work :(there is a dumb, not good dumb, bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger, shouting "it's a lie", as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next door.the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady, named after pinnochios daddy in order to move the clunky plot along, waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi. picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going... she got away. he could like try to run down.. or maybe ring the cops... or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than... i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending... mahhahahahah.pity it's so stupid. at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul. yes that's right folks. the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone. although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey he's all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isn't allowed. he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is. of course he doesn't mention a single example. that kind of sums up the show. buzz words and tawdriness.

will spanner (david byrnes, the fifth actor to play the role in the series) stumbles onto another bizarre case, this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches, warlocks & demons (he's at the hospital to check on his friend's son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl who's been attacked by a vamp in). he brings in detectve lutz to help out with the case which revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business merger to go through to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense.the plot of this movie pretty much takes a backseat to the nudity & simulated sex scenes. (as is to be expected from this series, i guess). so complaining about the lack of good acting, or compelling plot-line, or even convincing characters, i suspect, would fall on deaf ears. if you're watching this film, you don't care about such 'frivolities' and just want some 'action'. sadly on that front the film fails as well. all the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious. making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way.eye candy: both kimberly blair & april breneman show everything; ashlie rhey shows full- frontal; aline kassman & mai-lis holmes only shows their breastsmy grade: d

i think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected rage.the characters of joe and bob were relics of the wwii generation who didn't quite understand their kids opposing the war, taking drugs and listening to rock and roll. but i think their real rage was at the fact that america was beginning her long decline from the heights the war left her at."joe" himself is a low-rent archie bunker, ranting at all the things that have made him angry, living his life of quiet desperation, until he teams up with compton, a guy who wants to avenge himself on the hippies who ruined his daughter.honestly, most of the movie looks silly, the characters are worse than one dimensional, they're laughable. peter boyle was capable of better stuff.

joe was first released in the us in the summer of 1970. despite respectable notices, reasonable box office and an oscar nom, it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980's, before being enthusiastically reappraised, somewhat unjustly, in the us in the late 90's. thanks to this lengthy unavailability, its reputation has gone on to see it placed (inexplicably) alongside the likes of michael winner's original death wish. although revenge is a theme, a film about vigilantism this most definitely is not.the plot isn't worth synopsizing. its a flabby, hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it. that relationship and the largely class-based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature; these two, and their situation, bear absolutely no relation to reality.almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated, which makes the whole thing completely fascinating. hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face, and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly. its very much a film of the 60's rather than the 70's, so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the hollywood new wave is a complete mystery. martin scorcese of all people even got involved, though probably only to give a nod to the dank, lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced taxi driver four years later. but joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of easy rider and bonnie and clyde, rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethos.it isn't a film of any real artistic significance - despite joe's incontinent fury at everything in his world, it remains a story about absolutely nothing - but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. shot on and around the streets of new york city during the darkest hours of the vietnam war, and at a time when america (and, significantly, its cinema) was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard, the film ends up, in its own completely oblivious and accidental way, saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture it.but as a film? despite a really surprising and effective shock ending, this is basically a michael winner film, but not as well made. how does that tickle your fancy? ** incidentally, if you are, like me, a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes, then check out harold steptoe at 1:22:11 in the hippy art gallery.

this is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap.nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless.yes,there is some violence,but everything is politically correct like in a tv movie.this is not a completely bad picture,i can safely say that i found it quite enjoyable.however a lack of the originality really hurts "voodoo".all in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo-horror movies like "scream" are your favourite then you'll love "voodoo",but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film.

this is a perfect example of why many people say the 90's sucked when it comes to horror-movies. a boring voodoo-on-campus tale of terror starring the once so promising corey feldman (stand by me, the lost boys, etc). there might be just enough stuff happening to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't look too cheap, but this still is horror aimed at an audience that were in their very early teens during the 90's. i might have been part of that audience, but still i got as good as nothing out of it when watching it now. and nowadays, teens are used to a lot more and better already, and i can't imagine any of them knowing or caring about who corey feldman was. or, "is", actually, as the dude's still making films. but the only thing still linking him to his days of glory, is the lost boys 2: the tribe sequel that got made recently. and i imagine even that one isn't going to encourage anyone to seek out voodoo. just another movie that got lost in 90's horror for obvious reasons.

this film has the worst editing i've ever seen. this is yet another film to avoid at all costs unless you view it via mst3k. on their website, they wonder why the coast guard cooperated with this film. i mean, they let them use a helicopter!

muscular 'scientists', unpleasantly thin females in swimsuits, lots of beer drinking.. yet it's too long to be a beer commercial. oh, okay, there's some plot about a big shark-like monster that's killing people and stuff. but it's nothing you haven't seen before.

this movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen, it confuses you incredibly. the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film. a truly, truly bad film.

a perennial fixture in the imdb bottom 100, upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going!take the editing for a start; to call this choppy would be overly complimentary! indeed, had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue, then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have here. added to this, the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax. aside from the ever game michael sopkiw, poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly. yay verily, all in all this is a complete pile of crap if ever i've seen one.deary, deary me....and to think that lamberto bava directed this to....tut, tut indeed. note: this was released in the uk under the alternative title of devouring waves, although bereft of most of its gore scenes, which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching.

there's really not a whole lot to say about this. it's just really, really bad. the acting is bad, the script is bad, and the editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever. it's so sloppy and choppy that it serves only to confuse the audience. there's no real to plot to speak of, mostly it's a really fake looking monster fish attacking europeans trying to pass themselves off as americans. pass on this one.

the lousiest of all lousy jaws rip-offs was regretfully made by one of my all-time favorite directors; lamberto bava (here under his john old jr. pseudonym). you know how it goes in these cheap european imitations, right? they only want their monstrous animal to be be bigger, sicker and more threatening, but this more than often results in the opposite effect. bava's creature is a humongous sea-devil and it's more than just a shark! we're seemly dealing with a prehistoric monster here, with the jaws and appetite of a great white, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! it's up to a couple of dolphin-loving oceanologists to discover how this monster was able to survive all these thousands of years and why exactly he only started his killing spree now. the script of "monster shark" makes few to no sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland. the shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision of lamberto bava to only show it vaguely and in quick flashes. the acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well-handled. the twists in the plot are predictable and you'll probably have the most fun spotting detailed facts about the characters. for example: count all the cans of beer dr. hogan drinks throughout the whole movie!

what could possibly go wrong with a movie that includes a bunch of italians pretending to be flordians, and some vague-lava-octopus-crustacean-thingy as the hell-induced hellspawn-devil-fish?!?!everything is what goes wrong i tell you!this is a very good mst3k episode because the heckling in right on the ball, which without fault, is easy to do considering this movie is a piece of junk with a lousy and boring plot.9/10 for mstied version. 1/10 for un-mstied version.

yikes.i've seen quite a few bad movies in my days, a lot of them in the company of mike, tom, crow and the others from mst3k. so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny, it wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the mst3k commentary.the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the eighties. horrible music, horrible acting, horrible plot (what little there is), horrible dialogue and really, really, really, horrible editing. cripes.this might be called a turkey if it weren't for the fact that it's not unique in any way whatsoever. it's pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director cranked out.so, try and get the mst3k version. it's a pretty fun episode with mike and gang in quite good form.

a man (goffredo unger) is found floating in the sea among the wreckage of his destroyed boat, just off the florida coast. a helicopter winches him up only to reveal both of his legs are missing below the knees. dr. stella dickens (valentine monnier) and her partner dr. bob hogan (lawrence morgant) are marine biologists of some sort and are conducting research in the sea regarding dolphins. while out at sea hogan hears a strange high-pitched noise. intrigued he and stella hire peter (micheal sopkiw) and his assistant sandra (iris peynado) to create a device to locate and track the source, or something like that anyway as it isn't made particularly clear. meanwhile a scientist named florinda (cinzia de ponti as cinthia stewart) who works at a rival organisation called the 'west ocean international' is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone within the organisation. more people are attacked and sheriff gordon (gianni garko as john garko) is on the case. peter, stella, hogan and sandra all set out to sea. soon enough they find evidence that something monstrous and very unfriendly may be lurking beneath the surface. together with rival scientist professor donald west (william berger), sheriff gordon and the united states army they set out to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister forces at work as someone doesn't want the genetically engineered creature to be exposed at any cost! directed by lamberto bava as john old jr. this is a far cry from the classic italian horror and splatter films of the 70's and early 80's. the script by gianfranco clerici, herve piccini and dardando sacchetti is drearily slow and will put most people to sleep well before the 90 odd minute run time has elapsed. the monster is barely used, large portions of this film are made up of footage of boats and helicopters. large chunks of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious 'who's behind it' part of the story. there isn't really any gore to speak of, a guy with both his legs bitten off and someone with one arm is about it. the special effects on the monster itself are generally poor and it is shown in very quick flashes, disappointing. the cast of virtual nobody's don't help make this any easier to sit through. there really isn't much to recommend this film so i won't. don't bother, you can do a lot better.

i really wanted to like this film as i have admiration for italian rip-off cinema (especially jaws rip-offs!), but the simple fact of the matter is that monster shark isn't very good. all the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there; we've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema, lamberto bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, michael sopkiw, taking the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it's money, yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale. the fact that the 'monster shark' doesn't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design, but there's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it. the plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of florida (or rather, somewhere in italy) where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing. it's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive! the main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless, and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development, even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long. this sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant, although the fun element of films such as 'the last shark' and 'killer fish' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time. the thing i love about lead actor michael sopkiw is that he always seems like he's taking himself seriously no matter what film he's in (although he only ever made four). this is certainly the case here, although bava never really allows him to completely dive in, and often he feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film. much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup american lager, and it's not very fascinating; although bava does manage to come good by the end with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would-be captors. overall, there really isn't much to recommend this film for. as mentioned, i really like this sort of stuff and even i found myself bored on numerous occasions. for hardcore italian horror fans only!

this cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff, courtesy of spaghetti land director lamberto bava, who wisely left his name off this junk.the basic crux of this outing concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washed-up on shore in the caribbean. authorities initially believe them to be victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation unravels, turns out to be something much more sinister.all of this ultimately amounts to very little however, we have here - poor dubbing complimented by similarly weak script, which often consists of nonsensical jabbering, and is really of little consequence for the most part. acting can only be described as sub-par, which is par for the course in this instance. truly lax direction doesn't help things either.special effect mainly is for numerous close-ups of various gory bodies missing limbs, and so forth. of course, there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time, which looks something like a big monster octopus thing, where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation. overall, the end result is none too convincing, sure, but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion.it seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of low-rent hybrid of jaws and piranha, but the final product is just a bloody shambles, much like the corpses incessantly shown throughout this picture. i find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to warrant viewing this, so moreover, strictly for incurable monster movie addicts.

i wish i had something more positive to say about devil fish, but i honestly can't seem to come up with much. i can't even come up with many of those "so bad, it's good" kind of moments. devil fish is just plain old bad. the plot is completely derivative (jaws, anyone?), the acting is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are beyond bad, and the score is annoying. add to that the seemingly inept direction of lamberto bava and you've got one stinker of a movie. i think, however, that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget. it doesn't appear that bava had much to work with. by 1984, the italian film industry was in full decline  especially as far as genre films go. the funding available to bava was most probably very meager. film's like devil fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good. it's not the only italian film to suffer this fate. there are a number of italian movies made in the mid-80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations. however, having said all that and noting the film's many weaknesses, i can't bring myself to rate devil fish lower than a 3/10. i've even considered rating it higher but can't because i realize how bad a movie it is. why don't i rate it lower? well that's hard to explain. despite the many problems found in the movie, there's something about devil fish that i inexplicably enjoy. it could be as simple as my love for low-budget, cheesy, italian movies. maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed, but i enjoy what i enjoy.the mystery science theater 3000 treatment of devil fish is actually very enjoyable. i rate devil fish a 4/5 on my mst3k rating scale. the guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movie's many flaws. one very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when tom servo notes, "just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should"  highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in devil fish.

movie i have ever seen. actually i find it one of the more entertaining episodes of mst 3000 i have seen. not that it was good, but for anyone who has seen manos: the hands of fate knows this one wasn't two bad. the monster in the movie looked terrible, everyone wore upsetting swim suits, and the plot was laughable. i still don't have a clue as to why they made the monster, they never really gave a good reason. the lead female had to be the scrawniest gal i have ever seen. they would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead. on the plus side the dolphins acting was great!!!

this stupid, anti-environment wannabe "jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly dubbed, and stupid. there is nothing redeeming about it.plot follows some shark/octopus creature-thingy that appears off the coast of florida and kills some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason). his ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague sideshot of something bumpy over and over. it makes no sense, it's horribly boring, and it's conspiracy plot sucks.there are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence three times; the doctor slamming a dying patient's chest twenty times with a difibulator without stopping, even though he's clearly dead; the porno-esque soundtrack; the shot of the couple making love on the beach, with three different thems ("that us is getting ahead of us!") doing this; the ancient computer that sounds like kermit the frog; a beer-guzzling scientist screaming "i know!" a la dr. smith; the list goes on and on.oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (much noticed by mike and the 'bots) . . .the mst3k version is their best episode, but it's certainly better than the movie itself. "this is how i like to go fishing, guys . . . with a flashlight and a flamethrower . . ." - crowone star for "devil fish"; seven for the mst3k version

a "40 foot long" giant mutant squid with five tentacles, razor fangs and the ability to reproduce it's own cells terrorizes a small florida town. various marine biologists, doctors and cops plot to kill it. meanwhile, a human monster named miller offs people who discover the "devilfish" is a manmade creation used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! miller attacks a female researcher, strangles her, drowns her in the bathtub, tosses in a hairdryer, then rips the panties off her dead body!lots of false alarms are set when our heroes peter, stella, janet and bob set out on a high tech (high tech for 1984, anyway) "seaquarium" boat to catch the creature, who is frequently seen in close up or hilariously obvious speeded-up film to seem more menacing. and only fire can destroy it, which leads to a flamethrower-armed posse vs. aquatic beast finale.this jaws cash-in is pretty tame (other than a legless corpse and a decapitation) but watchable and benefits from an excellent antony barrymore score and a decent (again, for 1984) monster design. luigi cozzi and sergio martino wrote the original story.score: 4 out of 10

it's the best film that takes the first place at the sickest and an useful films ever made in this poor country. really u people even don't know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies, i'm really curious to know how many movies of p.p.p. or l.bunuel have u seen. the score of this "faield experiment" it reflects a lot of u're way of understanding things and to recognize a good/quality movie when u see it. we the romanian people have only one movie and until this day the status hasn't change & that movie is "padurea spanzuratilor". but i don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it. that is a movie that respects all the required quality's's of an movie. from the script to the frames and even to the quality/clarity of the picture even are past over him 41 years. i recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote. kudos will see u later .

the movie is okay. meaning that i don't regret watching it! i found the acting purely and the most of the dialog stupid ("oh no, this was my grandmothers bible!"). it's sort of bad remake of u-turn. a man arrives to a desert town out in nowhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. and off cause get's involved in something, he thought he could leave behind him. the movie is quite predictable and there is really nothing new in it. when it's finish, you didn't really care. most of the characters are stereotypes, specially brian austin green!! all in all just another movie from the states, but okay entertaining on boring wednesday night. imdb vote: 4/10

it starts off pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to la. but everything falls into place too quickly. there is a decent plot twist towards the end, but so many scenes that don't make sense. randy (played by brian austin green) comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club, when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? i don't want to spoil it, for anyone who does decide to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. even the acting, which wasn't bad early on, turns bad towards the end. don't bother unless you want to see how bad it is.

los angeles physician tom reed (vincent ventresca) survives a tragic auto accident but ends up going to prison in the high desert of california. when his time is up he lands in a small, wind-swept town named purgatory flats. his first stop is a bar, where he quickly slams a beer and gets hired as a bartender. so much for ex-cons having a tough time finding work. this is the first in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot of writer/director harris done's silly attempt at modern, desert-set, film noir.his first night on the job tom meets a sexy femme fatal named sunny (alexandra holden), who hangs out with a family of bad boys: the mecklins, consisting of uncle dean (gregg henry) and his two nephews, the drug addicted owen (kevin alejandro), who is sunny's husband, and awol soldier randy ("90210"s brian austin greer). after his shift is finished there's a shooting, and dr. tom just happens to be nearby. he agrees to treat one of the wounded and, most importantly, not tell the cops. i'm not sure that's a good move for a guy fresh out of the pen, but this script (co-written by diane fine) has very little to do with logic.tom makes a series of poor decisions that get him further and further entangled with the criminally inclined mecklin boys, including stealing medical supplies and hopping into the sack with sunny. everybody in the theater is screaming, "don't do it! walk away", but tom does it anyway.in a classic film noir like "body heat" or "double indemnity" we root for and empathize with william hurt and fred mcmurray as they get sucked into the web of bright, sexy, devious femme fatals like kathleen turner and barbara stanwyck. it's not their fault. we'd probably be tempted by all that money or that particular dame, too. but dr. tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances. sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character, and there's no money to tempt him. you're left wondering if he attended the same medical school as dr. nick riveria from "the simpsons".the silly script would have you believe that a redneck's rural home has almost everything you need to treat a gunshot to the stomach, and that one so wounded could easily hop to attention and effectively participate in a fist fight. it gives us an implausible car chase with one of those "the club" things clamped to the steering wheel. oh, that oil tanker that just exploded - no one noticed that.i wonder how such a ridiculous script ever got green-lighted? perhaps brian austin greer has more juice than i gave him credit for. it's obvious that he took the relatively small role of randy - a hot-headed murder - to show producers that he had more acting range than he displayed on "90210".it's also sort of sad to see nicholas turturro playing a stereotypical hispanic drug dealer. he deserves better than this.if you have an iq over 50, "purgatory flats" will have you shaking your head in disbelief. i'll give it 3 stars for the unintentional laughs and the scenes with the sexy miss holden running around in her red panties.

i read all of the other comments which made this movie out to be an excellent movie. i saw nothing of the excellence that was stated. i thought it was long and boring. i tried twice to watch it. the first time i fell asleep and the second time i made it to within six minutes of the end and gave up. i suppose that it was mainly my fault going in with great expectation, but i don't think that this would have completely ruined the movie for me. the movie was just bland. it had nothing that was spectacular or unique to it. the plot was not half bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue forced and the movie just went on forever. i would not recommend seeing this movie.

lots of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful sets. i don't think the plot supported such a vast expenditure. the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid, psychologically if there weren't so much macho bombast in the production. chinese movies tend to be this way, in my experience. and i think this detracts from the film.

now i have seen two movies by the director chen kaige, a very good one (farewell my concubine), and this bad one, the assassin. both movies depict crucial events in chinese history, fmc in the 20th century and ta the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century bc. fmc succeds with memorable characters, gorgeous cinematography, convincing sets, good acting and an interesting story. the assassin fails on nearly every level (okay, the sets are great, the cinematography is good, and the few battle scenes are quite exciting). but...the pathos. call me a cynic, but too much is too much. if you felt that saving private ryan was too pathetic, be aware, this here will make you sick. the dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem like political statements, subtle or entertaining is this pic not. the film is overpowered by its own pompousness. i am really surprised that the assassin gets such high votes here on imdb. 4/10

the net is a movie i never saw upon release, i remember giving it a pass upon the mediocre reviews and since then perhaps been noticing a snippet here and there when it's been on tv. seeing it now, fourteen years after it's original release, i'm a little flabbergasted as to how time flies. being in my mid 20's, it made my childhood feel ancient. i felt as if i should probably do some exercise before my body starts stacking up fat in all the wrong places. cut down on fat and sugar. too much coffee and cigarettes.anyway, that was the best part of this movie experience for me. i'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me occupied with retro heaven. look at those big cans they call computers. look, they chat in chat rooms! i remember those tank tops! they look.... stupid. and hey, it even stars sandra bullock. first billed! would you look at that.as a movie, the net is just an unimaginative, plain and totally routine hitchockian cat-and-mouse thriller. nothing archaic about that, they made them then as much as they make them now. bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd who's job it is to fix software for people who don't get "that whole computer thingy". as it happens, she stumbles upon some delicate information and after her vacation trip ends up with her nearly getting killed by a sexy lay who turns out to be a killer (played by jeremy northam, and she should have been suspicious by the fact that they are in an american movie and the guy both smokes and has a british accent!) she gets her "identity wiped out". her house is empty, for sale, and upon checking it out, it turns out that she now has got a new identity. a convicted prostitute and impostor, no less.now you might say that this is improbable. how could they possibly do that to her? even in 1995, it's impossible! that's true, but back in '95 a lot of people didn't even know what the internet was. i can see how it's a plot hole you could have accepted back then. what's far more disastrous though is the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. the movie obviously owes a lot to hitchcock movies (it's one of those thrillers that feature a merry-go-round by night) but hitchcock always made sure that his movies were plausible. the characters didn't act like confused maniacs when trying to prove their innocence, and the plot didn't conveniently lay down for a structure where one obstacle inevitable leads to the other. the characters also tried a little before giving into the whole rouge chase. has bullock's character really no friends what so ever? couldn't any old high school teacher confirm her identity? or like... her nearest pizza guy? oh right, she orders pizza from the internet. never mind. you figure the movie out pretty quickly. there seems to be hope in an ex boyfriend. you really think so? you should always count on at least one surprise. the net offers none.the internet poses a lot of danger, this movie seems to predict. but, had the movie been made today, imagine the troubles the villains would have to go through to ensure the identity wipe. not only do they have to do all those boring literal things, she would still have her facebook membership, with at least like 100 friends or so, and picture tags, not to mention she might be on youtube or linked-in, and what about her video blog with like 150 daily hits, or the webcams in her house and recorded video of her in other people's cell phones, webcams, web downloads... her imdb membership?

it's amazing to think that this movie came out only one year before star wars but seems a million years behind it in sophistication and special effects. actually, the art direction and set design (nice victorian space ship) aren't bad; it's the monster costumes that are the most laughable, resembling the "guy in a rubber suit" monsters from the lost in space tv show. the evil cave-man makeup reminded me of some of the aliens from ancient twilight zone reruns.the script is stilted, and outside of peter cushing's comic relief the acting is pretty miserable too. this movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad kitschy sf. and the music...yikes! a horrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that doesn't fit the time period of the film and which sounds like someone rambling with a minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.

this is just about one of the dumbest things i've ever seen. maybe not a worst movie ever contender, but if you haven't seen that many bad ones, this could easily make your top ten worst list. when you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original "king kong", you've got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle. then, taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to "star wars" the following year achieved a new level in sci-fi entertainment, this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time.now let me ask you, what would possess the professor (peter cushing) to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth's core? ok, so it was useful in fending off the parrot/tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) in the early going, but come on. somehow i don't think this is what edgar rice burrough's had in mind when he wrote his tales of pellucidar. he probably didn't have caroline munro in mind either as princess dia, probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade.at least there was one bit of pseudo-scientific explanation that i got a kick out of; i'm always looking for one in films like this. that would have to be how the sky at the earth's core was really the underside of the earth's crust, explaining that ethereal pinkish glow. but try as it might, the story just couldn't hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about hoojah the sly one or jubal the ugly one, much less those goofy half man, half pterodactyl creatures. to paraphrase the good professor - "you cannot mesmerize me, i'm paying attention!"

there is something about doug mclure's appearance in a movie that is a warranty of wretchedness. his dg initials are like a special cinema-certification, that comes somewhere before 'u'. cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer from both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own. he did excellent work in the hammer movies as dr van helsing. i'v seen him do a very passable sherlock holmes in 'hound of the baskervilles'. and his magnum opus was probably grand moff tarkin in the first 'star wars'. the only man but the emperor who could tell darth vadar to 'stop bickering' and get away with it. but - crikey! - he's done some turkeys. there was that lamentable 'daleks' movie for one. and here's another.there's a machine that's been hijacked from tracy island. it's a cylinder with a screw at the front and traction devices at the sides. i'm surprised jerry anderson didn't sue for plagiarism. maybe he was bought-off. yet if the movie is any guide, they can't have paid him much.it's 1976 and we're still playing about in latex romper-suits. that's about it really. some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad it's good' category. this one doesn't even manage that. it wouldn't even entertain kids. 'crash corrigan's' stuff from the 1930's has got more going for it.

of all the e.r.burroughs screen adaptations that doug mcclure starred in the 70s, this is the stagiest of all. it's so stagy, you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps above. the thing looks like a very, very big budget school play, or indeed, a very very low budget action movie, which it actually is. it's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries, and i do hope it was. the genre didn't die peacefully, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, fake blood and lousy sound effects. peter cushing must have felt a boy again, as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the underworld. what a sport he was, to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely.shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. yes, there are always monsters like that in a burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or void of any credibility. on a few occasions, during the elevated action-combat scenes where mr mcclure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. indeed, there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) draws towards the finale. and lovely miss munroe loses her underworldly accent.the triple bill, currently on the market, features this film plus two others - the land that time forgot and the war lords of atlantis. the first two are quite strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. don't expect any of these qualities from this film. get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see. after all, the makers didn't have any shame either.

why is impossible to write in french ? very kitch! this journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in 1976. these big "casimir" of monsters is completely ridiculous! the film deserve however a "remake", as was "king kong" (the last one), with a little more supplied scenario. the professor has resemblances with the professor calculus and is rather funny. david (the character) is enough inconsistent but cross(spend) to the people from below a good message " you unite and will overcome you! " altogether we would say a film made in the 40s. now that i said everything (or almost) the evil of which i thought of it, we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one, then the thing(matter) is even rather entertaining. hugh! such is my opinion! (translating french to english with "reverso" : sorry for possible mistakes !)

"at the earth's core" was on television yesterday. i was at my computer working and happened to glance over and see what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made. i was instantly enthralled by the film's shoddy production values, appalling acting (by all included -- even peter cushing) and horrific, unintentionally hilarious action sequences and puppet-monsters.the film is about a victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical buff american hero on a ground-boring trip in the welsh countryside. little do they know that a great evil lurks at the center of the earth's core....forget the fact that the title doesn't make sense. (if they were really at the earth's core, they'd be about 2700 kg/m3 underground and burning alive in a sea of iron or whatever it is down there.) forget that the puppets used in the production rival "the beast master" for being the fakest-looking of all-time. no, the real genius of "at the earth's core" is its naive stupidity -- a gung-ho action spectacle without real action and without real spectacle. it is in essence just a gung-ho movie and a stupid one at that. people who enjoy mst3k-style stuff will love this -- it's appallingly bad, and indeed so bad it is almost enjoyable in a strange way.

doug mcclure has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot . i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values . that's the problem with this movie - the production values go way beyond " so bad they're good " affectionate territory and become " so bad i think i'll go and see what's on the other channels " one case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid cushing and mcclure encountering a monster . it's painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection . it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot . have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces ? no really this looks like it was filmed in somebody's living room with the spare change left over from that year's doctor who budget . even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line " you can't mesmerise me - i'm british " is delivered in a very flat way ( a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express ) in a script devoid of characterisation , plotting and memorable dialogue . it's not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it's also infrequent and rare since the monsters don't speak . wouldn't it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in warlords of atlantis so that they could explain the plot . does anyone here know what the plot actually is ? a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline munro can not save . the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops

there i am sitting at home in the morning, suddenly my brother flips on what appears to be the stupidest looking movie i have ever seen. considering it was the 70's and special effects weren't to sharpe, this movie just about equaled the definition of crap. the stupid monsters, the stupid story line, and the stupid setting made this the worst movie i have ever seen. so bad in fact i didnt even finish it, i made it up to a certain point then proceeded to see how long i could go without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself. (im just kidding haha) awful movie

i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.

...but not this one! i always wanted to know "what happened" next. we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret's baby. i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie. i did compare "scarlett" to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first. rhett was cast beautifully, although no one will ever compare to mr. gable. i am also a strict vivien leigh fan!! she was scarlett. she fit the bill. not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with "scarlett" the job could have been done better. not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett, that was evident.overall, something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett, i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction. this movie is not worth the time.

as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

i've read the book 'scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it. i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed. the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like. one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed. it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. a fine movie, but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to alexandra rippley's book.

as everyone knows, nobody can play scarlett o'hara like vivien leigh, and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable. all others pale in comparison, and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions. one thing that i really couldn't get past was that joanne has brown eyes. the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those.the movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who. i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. it could be that i'm only 11, but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say, 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up. if rhett hadn't told her that, i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. she really loved cat, her baby. she likes this child best because she had it with rhett, her only loved husband. still, if you've read gone with the wind, you would see that children make no difference in scarlett's world. quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett. all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together, and scarlett took way too long to get to that. it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind, but then again what isn't? if you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie.i would watch it, just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind, regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile. it may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.

if you really loved gwtw, you will find quite disappointing the story. those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south, will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production (altought i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett). but, let me say that considering the novel, nothing good could came out of this.i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs. mitchell did for the film. it took me some time to understand how good the ending was: scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett, since she always got what she wanted. but there was no kiss in the end.then alexandra ripley came to "fix" this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been further from mrs. mitchell mind, i am sure).the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends, showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending.if margaret mitchell could came to live again, she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw.sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault. isn't it? is it any good if i don't compare it to the original? maybe. sorry to say i don't really care.i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's (suberb) work, otherwise don't even try.

shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. he does not know when to stop. when the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. when the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of konkan's greenery. when the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums... you get the idea. not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair. there are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13" tv. also amruta subhash who plays asavari is the worst actress i've seen in quite a long time. a normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly.i give it 4/10 solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad. the fact that a movie like shwaas gets to be india's entry to the oscars tells volumes not about the state of indian cinema but the state of indian judging committees. a movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty.

this is not a good movie at all. i cannot believe that after fifty years, this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored. this is a very overrated movie that got very, very lucky. it was given the national award, harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience. anyone with even a marginal understanding of good, quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars.i cannot understand where to start. there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award. that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie.the topic chosen is great. it is important that such movies be made  but only by people who are able to handle them. sandeep sawant does not measure up to the task  not even close. his direction is jumpy, confused. there is no clear thought process. he tries, but is not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. he is not able to show the initial horror, anxiety and then hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather. he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together. he is trying to cram in everything without any priorities. he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against him.however, the cast does not help sawant either. worst job  amruta shubash. she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job. how did she get 'tee phulrani'? extremely lucky and/or extremely influential and/or extremely pitiful casting. having said that, she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie. her act of the msw should have gone to the more responsible actor  sonali kulkarni. amruta subhash did not understand it. msw's work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm, strong exterior, as this is reassuring to the patients. amruta subhash's asawari seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working for.second worst  arun nalawade. i have never seen a more wooden face in marathi film industry (it is abound and everywhere in today's hindi cinema though). he is the producer and so he chose himself; no second thought, no consideration. any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producer's to do it, but arun nalawade would not let anyone else do it. over ambitious and obtuse, he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined. his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills. my choice for this role would be vikram gokhale.the music is uninspired. the movie is technically lacking. it could well have been an ftii project job.on the up side; brilliant performance by ashwin chitale. it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance. he put many of today's actors to shame. unintentionally maybe, but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance. also, sandeep kulkarni really gave a very believable performance. really put in all his efforts and it shows. the script too is well written.'shoestring budget' cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie. lack of funds dogs all of the marathi movies. cricket and hindi movies sponge all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scraps. it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out. 'doghi' was brilliant movie and it too was made on a shoestring budget. 'doghi' also lacked technically but it was well researched and well made. it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema. why did it not receive the accolades it so very deserved?  only proves my point of biased judgment.lack of research and not of funds, is what makes 'shwaas' such a bad movie.

the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. sadly, this version falls far short.the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden. one gets the impression the director did not read the book,so did not understand the characters.sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found.the musgrove sisters are so unlikable, one doesn't understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glance.the relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feeling.in the 1995 version, hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. in this one, it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book.this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship.in the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as mary thinks, they are only slight acquaintances.in the 1995 version, when wentworth walks in (the first time he sees her in years), the tension is thick. resentment is coming off wentworth in waves, while anne is almost overcome.in this version, while wentworth is courting lousia, it is as if he is truly invested, the undercurrents are missing. in the 1995 version, the viewer sees wentworth's anger at anne. he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne, as if to say, "see what you gave up, i don't need or want you anymore".yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates. in the 1995 version the viewer feels anne's shock that he would care if she was tired, we also feel wentworth's discomfort that he does still care. in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happened.the pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest, man or woman, is totally botched. the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment.when anne reads the letter from wentworth, it is as if she is reading a grocery list.contrast this to the 1995 version, where the viewer feels anne's joy at her second chance. we are there with her as she reads the letter. the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices. wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy.this production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened. the 1995 version didn't need to explain, we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the mrs. smith sub plot intact, while the 1995 version did not.the 1995 version however did include part of austen's original ending. the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr. elliot will want to move back to her house (which he & mrs. croft are renting) after they marry. this is a production to avoid at all costs.

usually when bbc releases a tv series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. usually the tv series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can trust the acting will make the it worth while. when i came across, persuasion, here at the local library, i was looking forward to an enjoyable evening, cause i read the story.i'm glad i read the story first, otherwise i would not think highly of it. further was i relieved to learn that the production date of this tv series was from 1971, since i thought, until that moment, that bbc had lost it. it is really bad, and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie.the only positive thought i have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any bbc or other product this century other than the young musgroves sisters, who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting, and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given.

oh, my. poor jane must have done the old rolling-over-in-the-grave thing. even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. whatever else you do with austen, the dialog should sparkle (even in this, perhaps her most serious work), and melodrama should be strictly out of bounds. alas, not the case with this production. by the time you get to anne's "frederick, frederick, frederick," you'll either be laughing or crying. unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of austen's work, you can skip this one. if you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.

oh yes, i have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. the acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad, so bad to the point that i find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. i still wonder who did the casting. each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. none appear to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. the direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. were the film editors asleep?the costumes appear authentic to the regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and i don't believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk. also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts, and the women have "big hair"---especially the woman playing anne elliot.all the female characters, young and old, are quite lovely but this doesn't make up for the lack of acting abilities. the actress playing "anne" looks as though she is in her forties while anne elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. i mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing anne believable? she spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. i wonder still what that was suppose to convey. regret perhaps? yes, this production is regrettable!the actress playing louisa was truly appalling. she screams, squeals, giggles, and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that i found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. how this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.the actor playing captain wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.the rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. how did they get together again? not because louisa was in a coma; that is certain. no, there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film. i rate this production two stars: one because it is austens' work, and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. the only reason i could watch the entire production is that i was off sick with the flu and i got it from the library. if you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds. i would recommend this film even if you have't read the book.

well, anne is way way too old. wentworth looks younger than she and he should not. louisa is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty. she is supposed to be average, not pretty. when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a complainer. lady russell is too old. this is crazy. if you read the novel, she is anne's older more mature friend, maybe as old as annes mother would be which would be around 18-20 years older than anne- so around 50 not 70! its crazy, doesn't fit. how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning? she smiles when she says "oh the worst is over, i've seen him now the worst has passed" yeah right. ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger michell version than you cant compare these two. that one is right on. this one is way off. read the novel and you'll know what i mean.

okay, if you discount the production value, the ugly outfits, and the big hair, this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version. first ann firbank (playing anne elliot), is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired. amanda root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big, brown eyes than firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production. anne is turned into a peevish, whining, boring character (and what was with the scene during the `long walk' where she stops to spout off poetry?). henrietta and louisa looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other (henrietta was taller). and louisa! never was there a more obnoxious character! it was ridiculous to think that wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard. when she starts to chant, `to lyme, to lyme, to lyme,' i started yelling, `shut up, shut up, shut up!' the best part of the movie was when louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because i knew i wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie. speaking of the fall at the cobb scene; it was the mose poorly acted, badly directed and edited scene of the entire film. how does a person fall three feet down, land on her feet, and still be knocked unconscious?on the plus size, the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version. they also put in many more scenes with anne and frederick at the end.i'll admit, i have bought this movie, even though i knew how sub par it was, but i'm a huge austen fan, so i'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels. watch this move if you're morbidly curious, or to appreciate the 90's version even more.the bottom line is, this version may follow the letter of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.

this four-hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary, primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen. they seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out. the film opens with sir walter reading from the peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles. this introduces the family - all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway - but serves little other purpose. similarly, the scenes where the musgroves lament "poor richard" serve no purpose but to drag the story down. some of austen's actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters. there is some fill-in dialogue, too, and this is uniformly dreadful. the scene where charles hayter is boring henrietta with his concerns about getting dr. shirley's curacy was only barely interesting as narrative in the book; as a scene in this production, it is stultifying the scene on the cobb, when louisa falls and is "taken up lifeless!", is entirely without urgency, and i wondered whether wentworth's line "is there nobody to help me?" might have been directed at the writers, as well as the other actors.this production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed, rather than an actual film, and this is most evident in the acting, which is the opposite of subtle: booming delivery of lines, exaggerated gestures, and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet, or faces when they are not speaking their lines. charles musgrove stands in his parlour, feet shoulder width apart, and appears to project to the balcony (if there were one) when speaking to the other people in the room with him. louisa musgrove's face, when not actively simpering or giggling, seems to be in confused repose. louisa is a giddy, giggly, ditzy creature, and i did not for a moment believe that wentworth would be interested in her. the costumes are a mixed bunch, but mostly awful, and anne elliot's green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised. we are given the dates at the beginning of the show - it is the late 1790's or perhaps very early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be of victorian design, and thus about 60 years too early! the hair is just so wrong that i won't even mention it here. except to say that i won't mention it. :-)this production does do some things right, however. mrs. smith is given her proper importance, and her history with mr. elliot, his dissipation and his intrigues, are fully addressed. i was also pleased to see the fleshed out "reconciliation" scenes with anne and frederick at the end, which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 production.if you love the book persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 movie, don't waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it sorely wanting.

boring, utterly predictable soap opera. mary tyler moore is married to ted danson who's having an affair with christine lahti. moore is friends with lahti and doesn't know about the cheating. danson dies in an accident and lahti is pregnant with his baby. yawn! i'm ashamed to admit i paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986. i liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off. i constantly knew what was going to happen. like another poster said--this plays like a pg-rated lifetime movie.it does have lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even moore lets loose once! also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football (!!!). other than that it's tv friendly. the only good thing about this was timothy gibbs playing moore and danson's teenage son. very handsome and quite a good actor. that aside there's nothing to recommend this. you've seen it before...and done better. it's obviously been forgotten. skip it.

this is what used to be called a "women's picture" and later a "chick's flick" when times and movies got more juvenile. the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types. the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too rail-thin mary tyler moore in leotards. (if you're of a certain age, like me, that might still be enough to give it a look.) otherwise mtm gives another of her typical by-the-numbers performances that she's been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was america's sweetheart. christine lathi gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type. (sorry, but it seems true.) ted danson is too young as mtm's husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften it. and it doesn't happen here. allan burns wrote & directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before, wrote it as a project for her, and she had the juice at this point to get it made. there seems no other purpose to it.

director/screenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. it results in a wincingly unfunny film. christine lahti plays a crass, cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family--only to discover mary's husband (ted danson) is lahti's secret affair! burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective (just increasingly annoying, because nothing important ever seems to get said). rail-thin moore, looking alarmingly frail in her leotard, has a radiant smile but doesn't convince as danson's wife, and danson gets stuck with a paltry, thankless role (he's just there to be a cad). the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching (woman's role in the workplace, the tv news-biz, the cheating family man, the working wife and mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendships, et al), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half-heartedly examines the issues. as a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but is devoid of a purpose as well, and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up. *1/2 from ****

this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie, and a the oldest that, obviously, is still in existence. this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the "more treasures of the natural archives" dvd.it's only a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. next to him are two men dancing. near the end, another man walks on the stage. william dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violin player. this "movie" had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success. it took over 30 years from this point to the synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment. however, this was a start, no matter how primitive it came off. for more of the technical information and history of this film process, see the other review here by "boba fett1138."

by-the-numbers, oscar-hungry biopic about the late, great singer ray charles. there is one -- exactly one -- great scene in *ray*. it occurs during a flashback to charles' youth, after the boy become completely blind. running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother, he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor. he cries out for his mother; she, in keeping with her philosophy that a person should "stand on their own two feet", observes silently and pensively from the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. the boy proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire-pit, the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window, the scuttling of a cricket across the plank-board floor.the movie pauses, here; it expands; it breathes -- even if for only 40 seconds. the scene is a much-needed respite from taylor hackford's otherwise noisy film. by "noisy" i'm not referring to the music, which is, of course, excellent. i am referring to the sound effects (big booms! preceding yet another flashback) and the inane dialog ("i'm speaking to you as a friend, ray," etc.). on the visual side, hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy: sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks; whirling-dervish 360s from the camera-crane, etc. etc. all the modern amenities. what a horrible cinematic style is displayed in *ray*! -- a style all-too-common in wanna-be "important" movies from the past decade or so (scorsese's *aviator* is stylistically very similar to this movie). these gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the cliché-ridden screenplay. some of us won't be fooled.some of us also are not quite prepared to accept jamie foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry. granted, foxx eerily resembles ray charles: he walks like charles, talks like charles, and even twitches like charles. foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. i'm not begrudging mr. foxx his oscar; he deserved it. (it was a pretty weak field this year, anyway.) but one wonders if foxx really understands charles. the actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band-mates are shooting up: he registers, if only for a brief moment, a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. the movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin, with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions. but the damn movie just won't take the time: it bounces along from triumph to triumph, never really pausing for any insight into the man. one has to stretch to find the dramatic tension; one must supply the drama for the movie. one must, in other words, imagine a better movie than this one.in its rush toward a glorious conclusion, *ray* introduces, then dodges, several excellent ideas for a movie: his early days on the "chitlin circuit"; his bold musical innovations for the atlantic label; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success; the man's importance to the civil rights struggle (touched on in the movie for, oh, about 3 minutes of screen-time), and much more. the filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements. two-and-a-half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good, but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art. this sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject -- and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this? if i had wanted a laundry-list of ray charles' accomplishments, i'd have simply googled him.3 stars out of 10 -- the extra 2 stars strictly for the music.

i was supremely disappointed with this one. having just read the wonderful oscar wilde story, i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen. well, there was none. this version played like a condensed, dumbed down reader's digest movie. not only did it feel rushed, it was cheapened and needlessly re written. major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed. i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially on what may very well have been a limited (tv) budget, but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way. i thoroughly recommend reading wilde's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors. but i cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty.

i bought a tape of this film based on the recommendation of other imdb users and have to say that i was very disappointed. i'm a college professor and showed this movie to my class; they unanimously voted that it's a terrible film. i guess that if you like the old dark shadows series, then maybe you'll like this. (i liked dark shadows when i was a kid in the '70s, but now i think it's just awful). the first half hour or so at least has the virtue of some fidelity to wilde's novel. after that, the story veers wildly off course, at least as compared with the 1945 mgm version (which won two oscars). nigel davenport as lord henry is really about the only thing watchable in the whole production. a lot of the other acting is bad, the music is melodramatic, and look of the film is terrible. actually, it's not a film at all--it was obviously shot on video and has that characteristically claustrophobic bbc look about it. the opening scenes are particularly poorly lit, the women's costumes are terrible (the men look all right), and a lot of the characters--including dorian--seem to have 1970s rather than victorian hairstyles. the movie does well to include a lot of wilde's dialog, but the voice-over narration in the voice of dorian contains a lot of rubbish that directly contradicts wilde's character. i'm a big oscar wilde fan, and i fear that he must have rolled over violently in his grave when this monstrosity was made. its only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent, without being heavy-handed. i haven't seen either of the more recent versions, but if one is interested in seeing the story well told, i would have to recommend the 1945 mgm black-and-white over this one.

it only took one viewing of this dog, for me to say "never again!" it's so profoundly unmemorable that i had to read other people's reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond (1) it was awful, (2) connery should have quit while he was ahead, and (3) the film included a total gross-out bit involving faking a retinal scan through the most gruesome (not to mention horribly inefficient) means possible.actually, i've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of connery's bond films over even the worst moore or dalton outings. or lazenby, brosnan, or even david niven, for that matter. i personally found octopussy and moonraker, among other "canonical" bond films, to be far more entertaining than this, and probably for the very same reasons why others deprecate the moore bond films, namely their wry humor, and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the whole basic bond milieu.

thunderball and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero irvin kershner. klaus maria brandauer seems to steal the show, when, in the midst of the unfolding plot, bond's mission turns more to hollywood romp (sometime around when basinger comes in). how about klaus kinski? i still think that the casting of largo makes or, as is evident in both films, breaks the story. worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the '60s. the '80s was a barren time for bond flicks mostly, though for your eyes only is a great title. at times, when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re-run festivals, i think the best attribute of the film is its score, and i'm not into soft '80s 'jazz'.

connery climbs aboard the moore buffoon train in this stinker of a movie. tossing away everything that made bond successful in the first place, this movie further degrades the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget. get smart this ain't. there is no style here, only second rate actors performing on cheap sets. it's a shame that connery couldn't lend an element of class here but it doesn't come across. everything here reeks of mediocrity, including connery's bad toupee. perhaps if i was snowed in and given the choice between watching "never say never again" and "howard the duck" i would choose the former. if you want the real james bond, pick up any ian flemming novel.

this is more than just an adaptation of bond: it's a plain rip off! with mediocre character sketches that ian fleming would not have approved of, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie. an older (even haggard) connery tries to relive his past 12 years later. the result is a humourless, tacky version of the classic hero. give me roger moore any day!

sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for connery was neither that nor the hit warners wanted it to be. overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and "robocop 2" are proof that irvin kershner did not have any real control over "the empire strikes back." connery hadn't been in a hit since he bowed out from bond in 1971, but this didn't bring him back at all. "octopussy" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. imagine that - a roger moore bond not only better than a simultaneous connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to "never...," "octopussy" is on par with "2001."the worst bond theme song, even worse than "the man with the golden gun," pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - my god - who cares?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled "bond girls" go. does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie? there were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this. and barbara carrera - just plain stupid - but the way kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn't help her out any. she is the seedling that would become the very impressive "onatop," which was about the best feature of "goldeneye," but that doesn't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film.casting leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad. two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together - witness the scene where, to escape local authorities, they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising - i can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh.

though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning frequency, and while most of the jargon that tends to limit bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention, there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of sean connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by jessica tandy in driving miss daisy. while connery had been less visible in the latter, his woman-seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which, to most involved, approached the 007 theme with kind resentment, albeit while the general flavor had been altered. great for those who interest others while faking to be who you're not!

not as bad as some people say...this is a unofficial bond movie and a remake of "thunderball", written by kevin mcclory (co- producer in "thunderball"). well, the cast is very very interesting, maria brandauer is a great bond- villain, kim basinger and barbara carrera are just like the "original" bond- girls, plus rowan atkinson and a truly great edward fox, who looks really refreshing in the "m" role. in fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. sean connery does it once more confident and charming, except that he looks a little bit too old. but alright, he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role. the locations are also typical- bahamas, france, etc. the only thing that really fails is the music score, the song "never say never again" is o.k., but the theme song is just missing. all in one, a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like "moonraker". only if there was another story, "thunderball" was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake

the murder of the red comyn in grayfriars abbey was a long way from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the scottish war of independence and fights (and killing) in churches wasn't unusual at all. not that much later robert bruces wife, daughter, two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed. and comparing it to the massacre of berwick in which the english slaughtered at least 8000 non-combatants (some, yes, in churches) is ridiculous.that said this is not a well-made movie. it is slightly antidote to the absolutely ridiculous sniveling representation of robert bruce in braveheart. whatever bruce was, it wasn't a wuss.too bad that they didn't do a better job of this because someone should make a really good movie of a war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone made up going from complete defeat at the battle of methven to a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war to bannockburn. this isn't it though. poorly made and to a large extent poorly written and acted. too bad!

this movie is the last straw in a list of films i have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join imdb and spread some warning to the public. it was absolutely horrible. the film was drawn out and painfully boring. the sound, effects, and even picture quality seemed like they came from willow (1988) or maybe even conan the barbarian (1982). the battle of bannockburn was absolutely absurd. this "largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the british isles" made me snicker. there wasn't even a coherent formation at all, just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them. the scenes of douglas, especially in the last battle, were simply horrible, as was most of the acting in the film.

so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo (drc) and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule. i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history, mainly lumumba and mobutu. i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule, the political motives behind each one, the reasons behind belgium's decision to give the drc its independence, and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved. sadly, all of my questions went largely unanswered. my belief is that this movie was made by people who, through a passing familiarity with the story of the drc's fight for freedom, saw a story filled with drama and emotion, and decided to exploit it. they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline, briefly filled them out with dialogue, went to the set and shot it. i could be wrong, but if so it's all the sadder, because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in, and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history. whatever the reason, the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentence-long statements and facts printed on the screen. the film goes through each major occurrence, and tells the viewer point-blank the main idea of what's going on, completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things. for instance, there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu. in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints: one that sympathizes with lumumba, one that vilifies lumumba, and one that stands in the middle, sympathizing and yet obeying orders. correspondingly, there are three soldiers that speak in the scene, uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view. then, to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up, the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting, more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up. this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie. most of the time, each character simply states their basic motives, the other characters respond with theirs, and that's that. there's little telling through actions; even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness. it's hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that. also, in the trend of this directness, things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact-- we never learn what these factions are, what they're fighting for, their power, basically anything except that they exist. the characters likewise are one-dimensional and flat; unfortunately i don't know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity, but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didn't trust it to tell me so. the drc, like many developing countries, has a complicated and important history, especially in the period leading up to and after independence. but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations. lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details, and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines.

dubbed beyond comprehension, the hbo version of lumumba is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film. some scenes simply don't make sense in english and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading. add in the self-censorship involving cia operative frank carlucci, and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power. here's hoping the subtitled version gets to american television screens at some point.

cute idea to have dionne warwick do the song vocals for this movie-adaptation of jacqueline susann's bestselling book (a la "valley of the dolls")...although it's really too bad this sudser doesn't have patty duke's neely o'hara to spike the story. "the love machine" is unrelievedly dull. even the final brawl (with an academy award as a fight prop!) can't save it. dyan cannon seems embalmed in her heavy pancake make-up and cumbersome fall (although her tiny, suntanned figure is a beauty to behold), john phillip law is a block of wood in the lead, david hemmings embarrassing in gay-mode as a flamboyant photographer. and where is robin stone walking to at the end? is he trekking out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors? after cannon has deflated his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. in that case, "love machine--the final episode" might've been a more interesting flick. certainly better than this yawn-inducing snooze-opera. *1/2 from ****

jacqueline susann wrote several novels all involving sex and melodrama and a few of them actually were made into films including this effort and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst films ever made. story here is about robin stone (john phillip law) and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and calculating to everyone around him. he's a playboy of the worst sort using and then throwing away every woman he beds including the wife of the ibc network president.*****spoiler alert***** greg austin (robert ryan) is in charge of the television network ibc and when his younger wife judith takes one look at robin she wastes no time getting into bed with him. greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named amanda (jodi wexler) who is in love with him kills herself. when greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of robin by using the morals clause in his contract when rumors start flying about his relationship with jerry nelson (david hemmings) who's a gay fashion photographer.this was directed by jack haley jr. who went on to be a very successful producer in both television and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems way over his head! the script comes from susann's novel and that would probably be why this resembles a cross between "alfie" and "the valley of the dolls" and i think the reason why her books never could translate well onto film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of tongue in cheek. with that, the laughs that come from this are unintentional especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film which starts when cannon refuses to give back the slave bracelet to the gay characters! hemmings was a very good actor but his role here is completely over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst beards in history and using the term "chic" in every other sentence. law was not the original choice for the lead but another actor that was cast had a serious accident and law stepped in and delivers one of the more wooden performances this side of miles o'keeffe. the film's script suffers in two different areas in that it's both completely silly and horribly dull and it will test a viewers patience if they choose to watch this. one has to wonder what would be the outcome if a director decided to film one of susann's novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous.

even though this film was nothing special as such, i am drawn to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favour - that of the lead female performer in the film, dyan cannon. in spite of the film's ridiculous storyline and what she goes through here, hers was the best acting job in the film, making the unbelievable seem more plausible. her raucous scene with the gay photographer david hemmings has to be seen to be believed. good work, dyan.

movie based on jacqueline susann's best-selling novel. it's about robin stone (john phillip law) a ruthless tv anchorman who claws his way to the top. it details his love life concentrating on amanda (jodi wexler) and judith (dyan cannon). it also shows his total inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get.the novel is no work of art (it's not even good literature) but it's a quick, silly, trashy read. but this movie makes it seem like "gone with the wind"! this is a textbook example of how not to do a movie adaptation. first they condense the novel terribly. in the book stone's inability to commit is dealt with and it's revealed why. here it's brought up...and ignored. also there's a truly revolting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. it's in the book--but there is a reason totally left out of the movie. and the book dealt with three women--not two. don't even get me started on the homophobia.adaptation aside the acting is pretty terrible. law is just horrendous as stone--very wooden and boring--you seriously wonder why all these women are after him. to be fair to law--another actor was cast but had a very bad accident before shooting began and law stepped in at the last minute. wexler is terrible as amanda; maureen arthur is truly astoundingly bad as ethel evans; shecky greene is unbearable as christie lane. only three performances stand out: david hemmings (having a great time) camps it up as a gay photographer; cannon is actually very good and robert ryan is just great. also dionne warwick sings the catchy opening song ("he's moving on").it is bad but i watched the whole thing and it is (in a silly sort of way) a lot of fun. i'm giving it a 3.also jacqueline susann has a cameo as a newscaster.

i remember when "the love machine" was first released to theaters. i was a mere 13 years old, too young to see the much-ballyhooed motion picture release, but not too old to take my mom's paperback copy of the jacqueline susann novel to school and pore over the 'naughty bits' with my schoolmates.though i'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age, but i was very much into the book. i bought and wore an "ankh" ring just like on the paperback cover, and i remember the ads for the perfume, "xanadu" that was cross-promoted and featured clumsily in the film. despite such an interest i didn't actually see the film until several years later. i should have left things as they were."the love machine" is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from susann's novels...which of course makes it the most fun to watch. its faults are many: from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread; its dated, horny (brass instruments, i mean) music score of ersatz bacharach; the flat, first-take performances; the boring sexuality -i've never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before. it's like a fetish! whenever sex, nudity or something sleazy is called for, out pops somebody in a blue robe! very odd, that; and most certainly, the circus train of awful 70's fashions that are on endless display. poor dyan cannon's performance (which is no great shakes anyway, but heads over the rest of the cast) is consistently undermined by the jaw-dropping get ups she's called upon to wear. however, the film's chief liability is the stoic, stone-like john philip law as (appropriately enough) robin stone, the object of every girl's (and one overthe-top flaming male photographer's) affection.law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street, handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot. just lifeless! not only that, but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something. he looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars. robin stone should be a hunk, not a hankie.for anyone finding the film hard going (it's rather slow by today's standards) i beg you to stick around for the climactic "fight scene." here ms. cannon (balancing 23 pounds of teased hair) finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers, setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now. trying to rival "valley of the dolls"'s infamous wig-down-the-toilet scene, "the love machine" finally does something right.jacqueline susann's unique brand of trash is sorely missed. perhaps someone out there owns the rights to rona barrett's "the lovomaniacs" and will revive the genre.

to preface my remarks on the film, i know the topic is horrendous and words can't adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the post-horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them. however, this film doesn't really deal with in a horrific way except for the first 10 minutes. some of the images there are horrifying, and should be as a reminder what devastation nuclear weapons can produce. seeing burned people walking around aimlessly or man combing his hair and clumps of hair coming out, etc., is not a pretty sight. but after the first dozen minutes, this japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of hiroshima in the mid-to-late '40s. i actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera. almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one family's problems at that point. this is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster. it's simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about 1950 on, whether one of the women was permanently damaged and if so, should she marry? this could have been a real impact film but it didn't go in that direction

i'd really have to rate "sex is comedy" as one of the worst pieces of dreck i have ever seen. the film inadvertedly showcases those which are the worst aspects of the french, or at least how they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery, and pseudo-intellectualism. i myself am french-canadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me, that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was! one doesn't so much watch this film as undergo torture to it, there was a total lack of humour, and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous, nor talented, as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with. instead, why not watch auberge espagnole, happenstance, or je t'aime... a la folie, three fantastic modern french films.

the first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie. not saying that i disagree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. to get straight to the point, this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad amateur porno flick. there are a few funny points in the movie, but with the kind of things that happen in todays youth everyday its actually kind of lame. the main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this. do not waste your money on this movie. the only reason why i gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl, thats it, thats the only thing thats worth watching it for. the end

as one who loves films that appeal to intellectual sorties as well as those that simply tell stories, this film should have been appealing. but as written and directed by catherine breillat who seems to be playing out her own conundrums in film-making experiences, this tedious and talky film fails to arouse interest.the main character jeanne (anne parillaud) is the screen form of breillat, a director frustrated in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors (grégoire colin is the actor and roxane mesquida is the actress). the one 'comic' bit is jeanne's imposing the use of a dildo strapped onto the actor in order for her to drive the sex scene to fruition, but even this sight gag wears thin quickly and we are left with a film within a film that feels more like a 'deleted scenes' featurette on a dvd than a solid french comedy with class. grady harp, august 05

i don't recommend watching this movie. it's a movie in which a movie is being filmed, with no attraction between actress and actor being played. the sex scene at the end of the movie which is to explain the reluctance of the actress (being played in the movie) to cooperate with the actor (being played in the movie)in it is a blunt repetition of the same scene in the breillat movie fat girl. everything there was played with more delicacy, if you can attach delicacy to a sex act like that. a typical french expression for the the thing happening in sex is comedy is oh la la! in breillat's film brief crossing there also is sensitivity. in sex is comedy i don't see real sensitivity and also a clear plot for the movie is not being developed so that there is a rather loose story with the disillusion of the end.

1 hour and 40 minutes of talking--boring talking, and more talking and then some. it is hard for me to grasp how an actress like anne parillaud, who shone superbly in femme fatale, would sign up for such a piece of crap! unbelievable. if you need a nightcap, this movie might help, although i would prefer some nice classical music. unfortunately, i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear--that's almost as unbelievable! so, short and succinct one or two sentence commentaries expressing one's core take on a movie is not enough. geez, people. i made my point and don't to waste your time with more, unnecessary words--as this movie does. wolfgang

i´m only joking. this was potentially the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to sit through. how anybody in the 1950´s could have raised a laugh at this innane rubbish is beyond my comprehension. i jest not.

"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"! if imdb would allow one-word reviews, that's what mine would be. this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film. the singing, the story, everything is dull and washed out--just like this public domain print. like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories (such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't age well. now that i think about it, i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! so my advice is don't watch this film. if you must watch an abbott and costello film, almost any other one of their films (except for a&c go to mars) would be an improvement.

this little cheapy is notable only because it is the worst film abbott and costello ever made. it is dreadful in every way: crummy music, horrid choreography (check out the awkward lead male dancer), cheesy special effects and sets, wooden actors (the leads are barely at the high school level in their profession and were unheard of later), and a script without a single laugh. better times were ahead for the comedy duo. abbott and costello meet captain kidd is much preferable, as is the television series, which at times was inspired. but skip this one.

although i am sure the idea looked good on paper, and it appealed to me when i first heard of it, this movie often lumbers along and falls flat, and when i watch it, i just want it to end. the bookend beginning and ending of the film about lou having to babysit a troublemaker is contrived at best, although i found the tall cop part to be humorous. however, i found little to laugh at with the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown together for these two great comedians. i thought that it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it reeks of "wizard of oz" rip-off (with the songs and black and white to color format). i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but die-hard a&c fanatics. anyone else will be disappointed, and they have many better films.

i'll start blasting the movie first. remove abbott and costello from the cast and you've got a badly colored movie, stiff cardboard from the casting department, badly dubbed sound (especially during the singing!) and annoying dialog (ex. listen to the line "mr. dinklepuss" ad infinitum). obviously some studio hack thought that they could cash in on disney's classic presentation of "mickey and the beanstalk", but maybe audiences were either more gullible back then (improbable) or stuck in a double feature (more probable). even children should feel insulted at having this movie shown to them. a total waste of celluloid. now, about the acting of abbott and costello. bud abbott always played the straight man, and by all accounts was the nicer person off the set. on radio, his character was usually the smooth fast talker, and was especially funny when his speed caused him to flub his lines and smooth over the mistakes. in the movies, he still plays the straight man, but is more of a con artist. not that he's bad at it, but that character has been played to perfection by groucho marx. the real travesty of the duo on film is lou costello. again, on radio he was funny. he played a character that was a little slower than abbott, but not too much slower! he was also glib with the lines, and got me laughing when he would ad-lib at abbott's mistakes. on film, i don't know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes a shoddy impersonation of stan laurel, which in turn was even more shoddily done by jerry lewis. why the change? he was funny on radio when he was a smarta--, but here he becomes a child-like character that looks like he's mugging for the cameras in every shot. this characterization is shown in every movie they do, and only brings a stain to the reputation they had on radio. what is left to their film career is a poor (very, very poor) copy of laurel and hardy. the movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of retreads of stock casting.

for some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. i think because my great uncle, buddy baer, was the giant in this movie and my father-in-law thought i'd like to see it. i had, years before as a child, and didn't like it then, either.my son, then two, watched it and was hooked. every waking moment in front of the tv, this horrid video played. i went to work with the inane songs stuck in my head. the two "leads" were worse than a junior high stage review. the dancers looked like rejects from an ed wood horror flick and abbot and costello phoned their parts in. thankfully, i was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape. frankly, i think it was the tape from "the ring".to correct another reviewer, buddy baer is the uncle of jethro (max baer, jr) not his father. 0 out of 10.

absolutely inane film starring abbott and costello. even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film.abbott as dinklepuss. what a look he had on his face. sure, he had to be part of this dreadful film.did anyone notice that costello's mother in the film sounded and looked like fay bainter? luckily, for ms. bainter, that she wasn't in the film.there is really no excitement hear for children. the jokes, if any, are quite stale. some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous.

i'm not really much of an abbott & costello fan (although i do enjoy "who's on first") and, to be honest, there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work. it wasn't really bad. it had some mildly amusing scenes, and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy baer, but somehow, given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which they're generally held, i have to say i was expecting more. as the story goes, the pair stumble into a babysitting job, and during the reading of jack & the beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the kid reading it to costello), costello's jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story. there's a "wizard of oz" kind of feel to the story, in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of real-life acquaintances of jack, and the movie opens in black & white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence. the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly (dorothy ford) are among the amusing parts of the movie. polly, of course, also leads to one of the questions of the movie - what happened to her? jack and gang apparently left her behind in the giant's castle! i know - it was just a dream, so who cares. still - i wondered. there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines. my 4 year old giggled a bit during this, so she was able to appreciate some of the humour. i found it to be an acceptable timewaster, but certainly not anything that would convince you of abbott and costello as comic geniuses. 4/10

i watched this last night for the first time in 40 years. it's bad. really bad. but it has enough hilariously awful moments, that it's worth watching. first of all, was it deliberate to make the boy being babysat completely effeminate? he even says to costello a la mae west "you fascinate me!" as costello does a double take. god only knows what would have have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk. this kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat! then there's the principal male dancer. he is totally inept. roar with laughter as he leaps and prances with no talent whatsoever over the giant's grave during he never looked better in his life. the two romantic leads are zeros, wastes. abbott gets to sing one line and that was dubbed in by another singer. geez, i guess he couldn't even carry a tune! costello does manage to be charming in his i fear nothing number, and i guess very small children might like it, but there's not much to recommend it. but oh that seductive effeminate boy! that aspect alone blew me away! plus the fact the family accepted anyone off the street with no references to babysit a child! today, little femmy boy would be taken away from them!

in need of work, straight man bud abbott (as jack) and comic partner lou costello (as dinkel) get the latter a job babysitting self-described "problem child" david stollery (as donald). young stollery winds up reading mr. costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), which puts costello to sleep, dreaming he and mr. abbott are reliving the story of "jack and the beanstalk" (you guessed it).the sepia-tone switches to color for the bulk of the production. apparently, this was an attempt at something different for the duo, a colorful children's fantasy. it fails, but this is where you get to see abbott & costello in color, silent film superstar william farnum (as the king) make his last performance a bit part, boxer max baer's brother buddy, and stollery before disney's "spin and marty".** jack and the beanstalk (4/4/52) jean yarbrough ~ lou costello, bud abbott, buddy baer, william farnum

most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance. i came out of this movie wondering what was going on. i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie. i intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious. i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back. movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film. the 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. in 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather. the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn't enough to save the film. (nor are the lesbian scenes!)

i bought the video for £13 at hmv (we pay more in britain) as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive.i have to say that the opening credits were a let down...the dancing/music not very powerful.the car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touch,..something unexpected...though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most directors ..but for lynch was something else.her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard; i thought another lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised self conscious. after a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation i discovered the new video cassette squeaked.i dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time.(and money)the two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough, though predictable. there were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes (the hoover switching on )there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous. eg, the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner. oh and what about the paint in the wifes jewels..boring and naff.this whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius..you know when you listen to the worst dylan track ever and think my god that was embarrassing....was that really bob?the whole feel is that of a failed tv movie , badly put together with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating.i whizzed it on during the last 30 minutes .do i give it another chance and watch again. if i want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film i will watch frank woods guide to consolidated accounting.lynch did one classic ..blue velvet and straight story was nice.this, like wild at heart, was a let down ; his weirdness is now predictable and stale. anybody want to buy a 2nd hand video?make way for some younger original talent, david.four out of ten (and no more). sorry.

if you don't like bad acting, poor editing, ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie. if you like all of the above, that is to say if you are a lynch fan, then you will love mulholland drive. this is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 7.0 on imdb.outside of naomi watts work, you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in mulholland dr. the other female lead went to the "hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops" school of acting. given the script they had to work with it's a wonder all of the actors weren't holding their heads in their hands.characters wander in and out of the film that do nothing to advance the storyline. you have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and her cliche'd poolman lover, a mafioso type figure sitting in a darkened room who speaks through an external voice box and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention. suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill up screen time.this isn't so bad however in that it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no discernable plot. you will wait and wait for for all of the loose threads to come together and in the end you will be abysmally disappointed. the hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling fulfilled. the easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then to take what few coherent threads there are and jumble them up at the end for the sake of surprise. guess which way lynch goes. surprise!!you know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make any sense out of it. after all, a dream sequence covers all sins. dreams don't have to make sense. anything can happen in a dream.the editing is similarly disjointed. let's just say good editing does not call attention to itself. much of the way this film is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to the editing. "look at me... you can see my editing... aren't i a genius?" uh, well... no! this movie has all of the earmarks of the worst and most self-indulgent french films.so why is this movie so popular? my theory is that it is just another sign of the decay of our culture. melodies are hard to compose so let's listen to rap. plots are hard to follow so let's dispense with them. pictures are difficult to paint so let's pee in a cup and stick a crucifix in it. these are the symptoms of our times and mulholland drive is just another part of the affliction.

i had stifled high hopes for this david lynch, whom i really like, film, but the very poor acting by everybody but naomi watts was the first clue that this was a wasted effort. some twin peaks characters are recycled into this film, but it wasn't eerie, it wasn't interesting (except for the topless watts scenes) and the quirks were poorly executed. i will probably give lynch one more chance, but the hype around this film just doesn't pan out, especially for those of us fans who saw eraserhead when it first came out.

a colleague from work told me to watch this movie, since he considered this movie to be one of the best movies ever. so i did watch it. first i have to admit that i dislike mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning.and this is the point, why i dislike this movie. it doesn't have any meaning. it's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, entertaining, absurd and thrilling pieces.at first i thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller (as the german packaging read), but the movie was too mysterious for me.david lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images, but the composition tastes to me as awfull as a combination of milk with beer. both for themselves are pretty good, but together?

this movie plays out like an english version of an abc after school special, with nudity. it makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be. it's not as though the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot either. while it does possess a certain watchability, virtual sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue. it's a good movie to watch if you're snowed in, the cable's out, and it's the only tape you've got.

it's hard to tell who this film is aimed at; the characterisation and style smacks of a "children's itv" series crossed with an aussie soap, yet the subject matter, nudity, and language aims it at an older audience.the first half-hour has the heroine justine philosophising about losing her virginity, and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18. a complete rip-off of "ferris bueller", from the talking-at-the-camera bit down to the on-screen graphics.her nerdy friend chas brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man. or actually, creates a male alter-ego of her, called jake. don't look at me like that; i'm just relating it the way it was shown.after this the film is mildly amusing for a while; amongst all the drama-school mugging, only rupert penry-jones brings a real comic touch to his woman-trapped-in-a-man's-body role of jake. there's some funny scenes with jake dealing with his new body, and new feelings; nothing you haven't seen before, but then in this film you'll clutch at anything that's entertaining.unfortunately justine and jake meet up, and hilarious antics ensue (i wish), involving the owners of the virtuality machine who want to kidnap jake in order to have sex with him, or examine him, or something. anyway, it's just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases; for such a cheap looking movie, the explosions come often and loud, suggesting the money was spent in all the wrong places.in the end, the heroine realises she can't fall in love with herself, deletes her alter ego, and ends up in a one-night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity (this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in the 90s). but only after he removes his glasses and puts some hair gel and a leather jacket on; god forbid she actually have sex with someone who _looks_ like a nerd. of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of pc movies which tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it's refreshingly reactionary to have a film which screams "conform!" at you, and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve.the characterisation is simple dire; the nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there's a slut, she's very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, vampy accompanying music), there's a jock, he's very... well, you get the picture. you can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy, but "virtual sexuality" isn't very funny. it's only mildly amusing in parts, and excruciating in others. it takes a lot for a woman as cute as justine (played by laura fraser) to annoy me, but she manages it.don't be fooled by the title; there's absolutely nothing erotic about the film, and it doesn't deal with the topics of how the new communications technologies are changing the way we view and acquire relationships (unless you actually think there _is_ a chance your playstation might blow up and change your sex).

oh dear. this was quite possibly the worst film i have seen in years. i mean what more can be done with the old "woman inside mans body" storyline? it was full of cliches, eg the nerd coming into his own sequence, the "lad" getting whats coming to him etc. im not calling these spoilers because any one could guess what happens!! the only thing it had going for it was laura fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the "dream" boy, that was the wettest piece of acting ever. even the bad guys were instantly forgettable.terrible movie.

laura fraser creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and he's suddenly brought to life, of course. oh what jolly japes don't ensue in a britcom flop so day-glo bright yet so dismal it manages to make the execrable 1980s american teen flick weird science look almost decent. the sex-obsessed script is by the sun film critic nick fisher, a former teeny-mag 'agony uncle' who's obviously never watched an episode of smack the pony in his life; shame, because then he might at least have been in with a shout of writing female characters that were recognisably members of the human race. this knicker-twisting lot have all too clearly emerged from the virtual brain of someone who imagines they're amusing. suddenly, the thought of new-wave iranian cinema is somehow attractive.

justine cannot find the perfect mate to make her first time the perfect one. with geek friend in tow, she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance. when she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination. problem is, how many obvious sex jokes are left anymore? how predictable can these kind of movies get? a few funny moments here and there, but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life. if you liked weird science or jokes about the 'fish out of water' combined with 'gender identity crisis', then by all means these 90 min, you could enjoy.

a british teen movies which centres around a girl (justine) accidentally creating her dream man (jake) in by the use of a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well.not just one) she gets trapped inside his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. it sounds a lot worse than it is, i found it more watchable for the reason that laura fraser was starring in it more than the film content, indeed she looks stunning throughout especially when she dresses in a red lycra dress in order to impress jake, wow!!, if only i had a virtual reality machine

virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america. the only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an american film would and a cameo by ram john holder, which is always welcome. that's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter's night.

miserable film. not even to be compared in one breath with "to kill a mockingbird," or "in the heat of the night."yes, there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous. come now. would you really have elizabeth patterson, of all people, guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching? patterson, in her day, played everyone's mother and was the landlady in "i love lucy" before fred and ethel mertz bought the building.imagine exhuming the body so that it will not come out that the black man's gun killed a white man?claude jarman jr., who was so fabulous in 1946's "the yearling" appears in this mess. he still had those sad eyes. my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful film.to me, this was nothing more than a faulkner flop all the way.

i was expecting a documentary covering the 1950 to 1965 era of sci-fi and received a big ol' commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by james cameron and movie mogul baby boomer's pushing the own works. 'watch the skies' has in the past referred to the 'giant bug' and 'space exploration' movies from the 1950's including such favorites as "earth vs. the flying saucers, "thing from another world" and "forbidden planet" as well as "them", "deadly mantis" and "tarantula". there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like "space monster", "12 to the moon" and "cosmic man". this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors, directors, stunt men and collectors plus the non-hollywood 'boomer's from the era been interviewed. i only wish there was a "0" rating available since a "1" is much to generous.

there is no real story the film seems more like a fly on the wall drama-documentary than a proper film so this piece may in itself be a spoiler. teen drama about 3 young singaporean kids (very similar to uk chavs) who play truant from school, run with gangs, get into fights, insult people on the street, get tattoos, hang about doing nothing, etc. etc, they generally imagine themselves to be hard and every so often shout challenging rap chants into the camera. filmed in mtv style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, tight close ups and animation interludes. the dialogue might have been crisper in the original languages of mandarin and hokkien than in the subtitles and i have no doubt that some of the contemporary singapore references will slip over western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless of course you are familiar with singapore. this kind of teen film may be a first for singapore but it has been done before and done better in other western countries, la haine (1995) for example.

this movie was a rather odd viewing experience. the movie is obviously based on a play. now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch. the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie. instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play, with over-the-top characters and staged dialog. because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching. at first you think its a drama you're watching, with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy, that leans really more toward the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre.the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable. sure, the actors are great; peter o'toole and susannah york, amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough'.the story feels totally disorientated. basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york. but what exactly is the story even about? the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. like i said before; i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out.the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences. more was to expect from director j. lee thompson, who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed, stage-play translated to screen, project.really not worth your time.4/10

contains spoilers. the british director j. lee thompson made some excellent films, notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear', but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings. the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland, and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister hilary, and hilary's estranged husband douglas, who is hoping for a reconciliation with her. we learn that during his career as an army officer, charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre'. this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle. the film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum. peter o'toole was, when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia', one of britain's leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and 'country dance' is not one of his better films. he overacts frantically, making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat, as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper-class twit of the year' sketch. susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better, but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. there is also little in the way of coherent plot, beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide.the main problem with the film, however, is neither the acting nor the plot, but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name. there are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary, or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part, and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. unfortunately, even in the swinging sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow, and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits. (the american title for the film was 'brotherly love', but this was not used in britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc?) these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 4/10

this is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. however, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have aged very well.long story short: extremely drawn out, slow-moving, confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never come to an end. by the time the film reaches its emotional climax, i had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care.watch it for its historical value as a milestone of chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you'll be bitterly disappointed.for hardcore fans only.

i remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure .although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way chinese people were making films at the time . they were admittedly inferior wlthout question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure . the kung fu craze had begun and bruce lee and ''the chinese connection'' would soon follow either that or ''the chinese boxer'' with jimmy wang yu . in any case this film was chosen to lead the way .

seems sensei seagal is getting more and more moralising and less "action packed". to date this has to be his worse movie... no action, a poor story line, an impossible plot and to make things worse, one of the cheeziest endings i have ever seen.seagal films are like seeing a dirty-harry, you do not go see it for the great social causes or impeccable acting... you want a good action flick.on a scale of 1 to 10, this one gets a 1...

steven seagal played in many action movies. most of them were bad but not bad as the patriot. this one is a z-series action low-budget movie. after operation delta force, act of war, the substitute 2, plato's run, the base, drive, sabotage, etc comes the patriot. now steven seagal is sure to be considered as a bad actor like mark dacascos, jean-claude van damme, treat williams, jack scalia, gary busey, chuck norris, michael madsen and many others. the scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe because of the very bad actors) and the 4.25 bucks you spend by renting the patriot are called lost money!!! i give it 0and a half( for laughs) out of 5.

okay, some other people have commented that this isn't an action flick, so i don't need to rehash that (even though i just did). this isn't exactly a let down, in fact, it's nice on occasion to see an actor try something different. but, unfortunately, this isn't one of those occasions.now, the story: non-existent. this film lacks in storyline almost as much as 'showgirls' did. sure, they throw in a couple environmentalist, no, not even environmentalist, something else, tidbits here and there to please seagal (being that that's what he's into). this doesn't make a story, not even close. now, the ending... even those amongst us who actually liked this film... the ending, you have to admit it was a bit much, or a lot stupid.now, from what i understand this was a direct-to-video film (at least in the states), but this is even too good for this one. this piece of garbage should have been cable only, on tbs or starz (late night).

i don't know about the rest of the viewers of this movie but personally i'm dead sick and tired of steven seagal films. when above the law came out, it was a great action film. wahoo. now in the patriot, steven seagal plays steven seagal from above the law. i get tired of seeing no character changes. it's the same character, time after time, after time. he needs change. this movie was probably one of the worst action films i have ever seen. calling it an action movie is giving it almost too much credit because there's too few action scenes and they're spread far apart throughout the film. i guess they wanted to go for some drama but it was a meaningless try as the film portrays nothing but the regular squinty-eyed-steven-seagal we've seen thousands of times over. get a new look and lose the pony tail is all i have to say, i definitely do not recommend viewing this film in any form, go out to eat, heck, rent barney goes to vegas but do not under any circumstances rent this movie under the precept that seagal will make a great performance.

i discovered "the patriot" in a dvd-store and thought it could be a real action thriller. no, it´s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. it´s no doubt a cable-movie and not one for the theatre. fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti-virus against sleep. one thing came over: it was the nice country the film has been shot. you can really feel the american air but that´s all. i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit. it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 4/10.

dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. this movie strikes me as foolish earnestness that has morphed into an unintended camp classic (the best kind). memorable lines include "knowledge is like a deer. chase it, and it will run away from you" and "drink this. it will make you feel better." it is so sublimely bad -- they couldn't have made it any worse if they tried.segal tries to convince you that he is 1. sensitive -- by saving a stricken pony; 2. a good father -- by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a man of science -- by looking at a fake spectrum; 4. in tune with nature -- by using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural -- by having indian friends; 6. an iconoclast -- by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab; and 7. an action hero -- by being really fat but yet can still fight. rotfl.it's good to see on as a late-night saturday flick, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) inebriated.

scott's collection of 80's icons cannot save this teen disaster. but then i suppose that's why it was only a tv movie and not a major motion picture. william a. schwartz (writer) comes up with something closer to "stewardess school", except this movie is more boring. this movie isn't really stupid, just boring and completely plotless. the only reason to see this might be to see tina yothers in an actual role after family ties. after this movie and equally dumb "class cruise", i guess mr. scott wised up and went back to directing sit-coms, which was his best move yet. 4 out of 10

this movie was, unfortunately, terrible.clichéd, hackneyed, stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchable.the feel-good finale is laughably lame.there is a reason judge reinhold's career has vanished.if you don't live in new york, and aren't jewish, several of the jokes will be inscrutable.i, too, found the need to have the unacknowledged lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insulting.i simply cannot fathom how this film was so popular at film fests.it is, without a doubt, one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time.

obviously it seems many people really enjoyed this movie, and that's wonderful. it is certainly a very well-intentioned film, and i appreciate that in an era of heartless or emotionally damaging films. unfortunately, the film has a lot of problems and it was not something i enjoyed watching.the primary problem is the writing. it is just not very funny. when something tries to be snappy or witty and fails, that is far worse than when it hasn't attempted wit at all. this film is to a great degree a series of "snappy"-but-gentle come-backs between adult family members, none of which seem imaginative or apt. there is also a few central premises in the film that seem like too much of a stretch of coincidence or character motivation to be believable or really work. some of the back story seemed more intriguing, and did serve to decorate the story around the edges fairly well, but it couldn't make up for the moment-to-moment flatness that pervaded almost all of the movie.the directing/editing doesn't support the film well, either, although i don't know to explain how exactly. somehow things always seemed to me rather fake, and that the actors were forcing there way through unnatural material for the most part. they tried, and i don't fault any one person here. there were also too many small and charmless roles in it outside the immediate family.not a good rental in my opinion, though, again, apparently a number of people found it very charming (i am 38; i suspect that perhaps people over 60 might enjoy this film more?).

i'm new to argento's work, and if this and suspiria are any indication, then argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than story. in his films, characters are placed in grueling and mesmerizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. the camera literally flows gracefully through sets as the characters run, stumble, and choke their way to an eventual horrifying conclusion. it worked, really well, in suspiria. for some reason it didn't work here.the problem i see with this movie is that even though the protagonist "gets help" by way of contacting the police and asking for help from her friends, it still feels as if she refuses to "get help" in terms of actually trying to find a solution to her problem. the entrapment in this film is that she's trapped in the killer's little game, one that she could easily get out of by... not setting herself up so easily? in a weird way it seems like the character wants the torture the killer gives her, which in a way is the point and could have worked except that the whole psychology of it is thrown about mostly due to whatever argento feels like doing.as a loving homage to "the phantom of the opera", it's certainly an interesting and unique take. for all his worth, argento delights in operatic movements as well, which well highlights the action. it just doesn't make much sense, especially as it delves further into a completely useless ending (yes, i know it's a reference to harris' novel "red dragon". no, it didn't work). why the character should go from one horrifying experience of entrapment to a willing one with the director is beyond me. it felt almost self-serving on argento's part.overall, a fun experience, and between this and suspiria i'm more than willing to follow up on more argento productions. but this is not a movie i'd want to return to or remember.--polarisdib

this movie is truly amazing,over the years i have acquired a taste for japanese monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor. however this one reaches a new low, as it follows the adventures of johnny sokko(?), a young boy who controls a giant robot, and his fight against the evil gargoyle gang, who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their disposal.

the discussion has been held a thousand times. is the "merchant of venice" antisemitic? (i think it is.) isn't it unfair to always point out this little bit of antisemitism in an otherwise great piece of art? (i think it isn't.) does this play stain shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright? (i think it does.) does it play a role if he didn't do it on a particular racist purpose? (i think it doesn't.) michael radford knew all this and this is why he added to his movie a prologue about the pitiful situation of the jews in renaissance venice.in vain; for the play remains what it has always been and the new make-up only gives a first (but futile) hope that someone has dared to set something right that remains a permanent outrage, not because its degree of antisemitism would be particularly shocking but because the play comes under the name of william shakespeare.why spend so much time in portraying the hatred of a man -- shylock? why employ a great and serious actor like al pacino, if in the end everything is getting ruined in this outrageous (but hey, i'm-not-responsible-shakespeare-wrote-it) court room scene. and now i'd like to be very precise, just like shylock himself.he's demanding his right, according to the contract which the -- not very responsible -- christian antonio, who always used to look down on him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. sure, what shylock demands is cruel and useless, but that's not the point. what we see (or should see) is a man who has been humiliated for all his life, to the point where all what remains on him is his hatred. i think, it is certainly a bit inappropriate to lecture such a man on things like compassion.but what the play/the movie (they are one and the same now) does at this point is... become a soap opera! the cruel madman with his knife, the horrified (but rather short-minded) audience, the poor "victim" tied to his chair. true, antonio accepts his fate but why can't he just say one word, "sorry"? i think we need not lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young dottore from padua; it's a truly "popular verdict" not much different from what would be seen 400 years later in the show trials of the nazis. from one minute to the next this jew is robbed of everything he owned, sentenced to being baptized christian, and kicked out.isn't that outrageous??? obviously not. the story moves on to the romantic intricacies of the rings and its happy end.what one can learn in libeskind's jewish museum in berlin and similar places all over the world is that antisemitism often goes unnoticed by the mass because what's so devastating for a minority or some individuals is embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority. it should be exactly the task of everyone of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendencies.i don't accept the excuse that this film was made to create empathy with the badly treated shylock (it just doesn't work out). i don't think that anybody can be forced to be merciful.i don't recommend this movie; in particular not for an oscar.

i have long tried to understand why people like shakespeare so much and every few years i give him another go. i was hoping that this play/film (my 6th different shakespeare play) would unlock the lucky casket and marry me to the riches of this literary demigod. bah, i clearly chose the wrong key.once the phrase "pound of flesh" had been uttered 10 minutes into the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, which grinds along with a languid script and lifeless acting. at every step, the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance. the concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is incredulous. it is no surprise who wins the matrimonial jackpot because bassanio's a main protagonist in the play.... and he's the third man to try .... and there are three caskets to choose from ... and his friend risks his life to pay the dowry. the only genuine surprise that i had watching this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case. however as soon as the ring treachery began it was immediately apparent what would transpire.ok so i know that millions of you love shakespeare not for the surprise in the well known stories but for the depth and passion of the characters. but i felt nothing for the characters. rather than gripped with suspense and admiration during the court scene i sat there impassionately hoping that it would be over, soon, please.one day, i might just find a shakespeare play that does something other than bore me.

i have to admit that although i'm a fan of shakespeare, i was never really familiar with this play. and what i really can't say is whether this is a poor adaptation, or whether the play is just a bad choice for film. there are some nice pieces of business in it, but the execution is very clunky and the plot is obvious. the theme of the play is on the nature of debt, using the financial idea of debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions. that becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with shylock, which unfortunately descends into garden variety anti-semitisim despite the bard's best attempts to salvage him with a couple nice monologues.outside of jeremy irons' dignified turn, i didn't think there was a decent performance in the bunch. pacino's yiddish consists of a slight whine added to the end of every pronouncement, and some of the better shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard "pacino gets angry" scene that his fans know and love. but lynn collins is outright embarrassing, to the point where i would have thought they would have screen-tested her right out of the picture early on. when she goes incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we're not supposed to laugh at. with joseph fiennes standing there trying to look sincere and complicated, it's hard not to make devastating comparisons to gwyneth paltrow's performance in "shakespeare in love." the big problem however that over-rides everything in this film is just a lack of emotional focus. it's really hard to tell whether this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy or a strangely silly drama. surely a good summer stock performance would wring more laughs from the material than this somber production. the actors seem embarrassed to be attempting humor, and unsure of where to place dramatic and comedic emphasis. all of this is basically the fault of the director, michael radford, who seems to think that the material is a great deal heavier than it appears to me.

last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of macbeth. it was 25 years old, filmed w/no props except swords, no furniture except chairs. it was riveting. the acting was super - all the actors trained brits. contrast that performance to this...yawn yawn yawn. al pacino, as shylock, was tragic, heavy, and couldn't quite lose the new yorker accent, despite the long....pauses....between.....lines.... the whole thing was soporific, even the "comic" scenes were barely even worth a smile, let a lone a belly laugh. this is supposed to be funny. they tried to make it tragic. it was neither, just boring. i give it four points for costumes, scenery, and jeremy irons, who is good at playing a dull, depressed, deep-voiced guy (can he be anything else???)

this movie really sucks.just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this baloney about a nice girl (joan woodbury) who gets involved with the 'underworld' because she needs money (and because she's too lazy to take a job from friends after they offer it to her). alan ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but he's nowhere to be found for the first freaking half hour and when he does show up, he stands around like a constipated mannequin. a real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable (as well as stupid) characters to make you wish somebody would shoot anybody, like really fast.bring a pillow.

i couldn't make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir.the plot was confusing, the acting was alright, but the picture quality was awful! though i bought this at a "gansters double pack" (8 movies on two discs) at walmart for $5.50 and when you put the dvd in, it apologizes for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have.the plot was flip flopping everywhere i couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on...then "the end" popped up and the movie was over. what a waste of my time!i say don't waste your money or time on this! or if you too bought that gansters double pack then just skip over this one...2/10

as a young lass, beautiful joan woodbury (as rita adams) was orphaned, after her "stool pigeon" father was shot to death. as a young woman, ms. woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job, as her murdered father's ex-convict status makes woodbury a bad business risk. woodbury rooms with understanding songstress linda ware (as donna andrews), who advises woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends john archer (as bob elliott) and jack la rue (as mickey roman). but, none of her friends can help when woodbury is the victim of a scam, which lands her in prison. upon release, woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money re-titled "gangs, inc.", this is an obviously weak, cheap mobster melodrama. still, it's a lot of fun to watch woodbury work wonders with inferior material. she plays the innocent growing more sophisticated "rita" quite convincingly; and, she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker. woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized hollywood actresses of the past. "paper bullets" also features an early alan ladd (as jimmy kelly aka bill dugan). ms. ware, who sang the hit "an apple for the teacher" with bing crosby, sings a couple of fair '40s numbers nicely. but, mainly, it's woodbury's show.**** paper bullets (1941) phil rosen ~ joan woodbury, linda ware, alan ladd

my question is what was the worst element of this movie? was it the acting? directing? script?. maybe it was the waste of alan ladd and jack larue. larue and, especially, ladd are capable of bringing extreme sinisterness to a role. in this movie, it was hard to tell who the bad guy was. granted, ladd was playing an undercover good guy, but even in his good guy roles, he could be very chilling. so, the net result was a potentially good movie bereft of any feeling of conflict.

this obviously was a pretty low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise had promise, and something more could have been done with it, but the script wasn't that great- the plot is incoherent and seems almost random at times and the dialog is stilted and terrible.basically, a girl's father gets whacked by fellow gangsters, and later she becomes a robber, and wants to avenge his death, and then it goes into a mob protection racket involving corrupt politicians.alan ladd gets top billing but he really plays a very minor role.i have to say i found it mildly entertaining in its archaic b-grade hokiness but it really is shoddy and pathetic.

what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury, who awe-struck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic "algiers", in a leading role. she does well as rita, an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss. her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawford's characters, e.g. mildred pierce, who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower. if you're looking for a film noir classic, better look elsewhere. at several points, it's difficult to know where this story is going. i first got the impression that it was going to encompass rita's plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son. but payback time ended up being only a minor point, and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film, where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption. anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so a second viewing should clear up any haziness. my copy is from a platinum box set called "mobster movies". the picture quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly skipping fragments of dialog. there are eight films in the $5.50 box, making each movie a fair 69 cents. look for anne archer's father, john archer, as rita's childhood friend bob. alan ladd doesn't get much screen time. it's definitely joan woodbury's picture.

i gotta go with my boy allen (who also reviewed this film)...zombie gangbangers (as my copy is entitled - guess they left out the "ninja" part after realizing there isn't a single "ninja" nor reference to ninjas anywhere in the whole f!cking film...) is a total wasted of time. honestly one of the most boring, retarded "films" i've ever had the displeasure of viewing.a hooker is repeatedly (un-graphically) raped by two zombies, and then by a cop (again, un-graphically) when the cop doesn't believe her story. she meets a guy who was beaten up by said zombies and the two try to find a way to seek vengeance on the undead culprits...first off - there is no "gangbanging" (or really other "banging" at all) to be had in zombie ninja gangbangers. i was hoping to at least get some sort of horror/porn hybrid a la porn of the dead, or re-penetrator, or perhaps perverted stories - but no - there was absolutely no sex in this film. at least a bit o' the ol' in-out might have redeemed this boring garbage to some degree, but without it, we get a bunch of poorly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero payoff. i'm all for "trash" films and most other schlock, gore, porn, and exploit material, but this one honestly sucks in every conceivable way. save your time, pass this one up...1/10 (and the one is only for a few brief shots of some sub-par titties...)

this is one cheap looking movie! a stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. she goes to the police who also rape her. she finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'the zombie master'. the fact that stephanie beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film.

this is a cheap-o movie made by al adamson--a man who was perhaps the worst film maker ever--even possibly worse than ed wood, jr.. adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s, 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves, hell's bloody devils, satan's sadists and lash of lust it's obvious he wasn't making shakespeare!! his movies all had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting.here in brain of blood, several stock adamson actors (such as his wife, regina carrol, zandor vorkov and angelo rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in adamson's previous film, dracula versus frankenstein. this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood can't help but look good! sure, the makeup is laughable, the plot dumb (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting is level z, but it's still better than their last film! about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor, midget angelo rossitto actually had a better than usual part--with more dialog and a more important role in the plot--and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times. as for ms. carrol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick. however, it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans--you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light!

in the muslim country of khalid (fictional), its benevolent leader/dictator,reed hadley as amir, is dying of cancer. amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds. his body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death) consisting of his doctor (nigserian) and mohammed, out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant. the surgery is being performed by the disgraced dr. kent taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. one of them is about 3 feet high (master blaster did indeed run barter town) and the other is a mutilated & traumatized 7 foot giant named gor. what could possibly go wrong??did i forget to mention amir's deathbed american, blonde-barbie wife, tracy or that dr. kent has a dungeon with female slave test subjects & delusions of grandeur? how about a brain transplant that didn't take? there is a lot of double-dealing throughout this and people are killed, but i'm not going to lie to you anymore : mission accomplished. the ends justify the means. if you can accept that then you will not have to waste 80 minutes. i hope that is warning enough. don't say i didn't warn you. if you must watch, then don't watch alone and have plenty of medicine standing by.-celluloid rehab

i'm not sure i've ever seen a film as bad as this. awful acting, all over the place plot, terrible special effects. there are some 'so bad its good' moments in here but not really enough to maintain interest. the woman who plays tracey looks hideous. there are some fairly worrying scenes with a dwarf which leave you feeling ever so slightly violated. on the plus side the operation scenes are fairly amusing for the special effects as is the car chase where one car is "trying to force us off the road" without actually making contact. guess the budget didn't stretch to trashing cars. oh and what looks like a postcard of the taj mahal is shown every time they cut to the fictional foreign country.

any time a movie feature a dwarf or a midget in a prominent role, the odds are 10-to-1 that the director threw him in because he didn't know what else to do to keep the movie interesting. in this case, the featured little guy isn't all that bad - he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes (except the part where he drags the leading man down the stairs of the dungeon), but the movie itself uses him like a doggie chew toy. the problem here is a common one with low budget exploitation movies - there's a germ of a decent idea in here, but the director and the screenwriter don't know how to develop it. a good director would take the various story elements - brain transplants, mad doctors with secret labs and a dungeon, car chases, fist fights, dim-witted monstrous frankenstein style assistant, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy, etc...and make an exciting, involving film full of cheap thrills and fun. instead, what we get here is a bunch of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab, then a cheesy operation where the patient bleeds tempura paint, followed by some of the same people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab some more, followed by another subgroup of the initial group driving around and having an accident, followed by a dungeon escape scene that is mostly about a woman putting her shoes back on, followed by a rooftop chase (the actual high point of the movie), followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from everyone else, followed by a lovely stroll in the countryside where everyone either chases, bumps into, attacks or escapes from everyone else again, followed by, well, not much else. somewhere in here is a scary peroxide blonde dressed in white, a well meaning heroic type who is sort of blandly good looking, a three foot lab assistant, a big lunk with a mass of melted rubber pasted to one side of his face, a kid who wonders into the middle of the movie to provide more of the "frankenstein factor", a brunette who sort of falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the mad doctor himself,who must be the luckiest man in the history of evil super-villains, because nothing goes according to his plan, but things work out for him anyway... and all because he remembered to stick an electrode into the transplanted brain at one point in the operation. this was by no means the worst movie i've seen, or even the worst exploitation movie i've seen, or even the worst badly made exploitation movie i've seen, but it just lies there, oozing cheapness and inattention to detail at every point, and there is no real reason for even bad movie enthusiasts to watch it.

first off i am in my mid 40's. been watchin horror films since i was a kid so i have seen a lot of variety. imo,this is not as bad as the multitudes that gave this a 1 or 2. yes,it is a low budget horror flick. the dialog is soso and acting tolerable,sometimes. the basis of this film plotwise is actually pretty good. for those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on dvd. this is very much like a 1970's movie of the week. just add in blood and minor gore,minor t & a and swearing, without big names. that is it to a t. i would rather watch this than jason vs godzilla or whatever other continuois crap is out there. tho not as good, evil dead was a low budget film. at least give these guys credit for trying. with acouple mil budget this could have been a pretty good flick. my score a watchable 4.

dark harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semi-professional movie. unfortunately the poor effects, wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best. by no means is dark harvest the worst horror movie i've ever seen, it just isn't anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel. you know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a) there is some pointless nudity and b) the movie's so short they add some rather boring outtakes at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn't that good! a slightly better movie which i can't help feeling was the inspiration for dark harvest is the eighties movie 'scarecrows' which is an ok movie but still pretty average.dark harvest isn't as bad as some of the other comments say it is but don't think that you will be entertained much either. one thing i also have to comment on is the character of angela who has a really terrible english accent! what was the point in that?! to maybe give it a certain touch of class? yeah right! english people do not say "waahtaah" when they mean to say "water" and i don't care what part of england they are from! if you can't find a genuine english actress or a non-english actress who can put on a brilliant english accent (not many of them about) then don't bother! sheesh! final score: 4/10

another stupid "movie". the quality of image is correct. sound too. music is middle. the guy try make music like in halloween.for one rare time, producer/director choose no-anorexic girls. it is cause this "movie" take one week to do and cost $10,000. does it mean when producer have money they choose all anorexic girls? good question.but girls in this "movie" are physically correct. but they are not good actress. neither guys too. but maybe it's just cause the "story" of this "movie" have no value.i'm sure we give $10,000 to some teen who like movie, and they can create a better movie.don't lose your time to watch this "thing".

i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. but to say that it was one of the worst movies i've ever viewed would be putting it lightly. i'm wondering if there isn't some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced. i mean, the financing had to come from somewhere, someone had to put up money for this to be produced!!??i'd pinpoint several production values that led to the failure of this film, but this film violated every production standard in the universe. i couldn't make it thru the entire movie, as i started getting dizzy the from horrendous filming techniques. i also can't tell you how many scenes i just ended zoning off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialog.i feel like i've been permanently scarred for life. if you viewed this movie before getting this warning, you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity.

this is one of those films that you watch with a group of people. you will have the best time. it's really, really bad, like showgirls bad but without the quality of showgirls.you've got the best mix of bad actors, bad director and bad script here. everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening, you have here. the first being the tag line is "a bunch of teenagers..." these people are as much "teenagers" as my grandmother.the director has zero sense of suspense or tension. the 30 year old "teenagers" are standing around and the "monster" comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. there is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything. it's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went. and when i use the word "monsters" i exaggerate. more like a couple guys in halloween masks bought at the .99 cent store.there is no doubt this script was spun off in a couple days, no rewrites and i can only imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue. it's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie.but of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting. it's as bad as you can get. there isn't one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst. he delivers every line in this monotone manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie, no matter who he knows. when he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes i've ever seen in a movie. watching these people reciting some of the awful dialog is very very funny. but when the black guy said "tell her...tell her...i love her..." before his death scene, there was a huge laugh among our group. funny, funny stuff.my only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs: in the imdb lowest rating 100 movies. we can do it, folks!ps. is it any surprise that the one "great" comment this movie got in here was from someone in virginia (who has one comment, only on this movie and nothing else). and guess where the movie was made? virginia. i've said it before and i'll say it again: people who work on the movie should not be allowed to comment on it.

straight to video and with good reason. its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard, but worse. a young man,(don digiulio) inherits a farm in west virginia that has been dormant for generations. he decides to take a few friends to check the property out. this farmland used to produce good corn crops, even during the great depression. the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and watering the fields with their blood. then hang their bodies out as scarecrows. the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny one-liners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off. cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick. along with digiulio in the cast: jeanie cheek, b.w. york, booty chewning and jessica dunphy.

this is an irredeemably stupid, boring, unimaginative, lazily put together piece of garbage. when watching a direct to video slasher pick, it is only fair to expect the film to be trashy on some level, but this goes beyond trashy. it is just horrible on every level, with a cliché ridden script that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time, a cast of no name over actors, and some of the worst special effects i have ever seen. even fans of slasher movies won't be able to find anything here that would make this film a worthwhile use of an hour and a half. the plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote farm in west virginia that one member of the group has recently inherited. unfortunately for the teenagers, the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices in order to help his crops grow, or something stupid along those lines, and now some evil scarecrows are out to kill everybody. i don't know anything about writer director paul moore, but i am assuming he is over ten years old, and therefore he ought to be able to come up with something more original than killer scarecrows. honestly. the special effects bringing the scarecrows to life are laughably poor. they often look like hardly more than haloween costumes on sticks. special effects such as these would have been considered rather rather poor twenty years ago, but by todays standards, they are nothing short of embarrassing. this is a total waste of time for all viewers, whether or not they are into horror movies. if you must watch a slasher film, rent any one of the "friday the 13th" or "halloween" movies. most of them aren't very good, but are certainly superior to crap like this.

i woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing and i fancied getting a movie, something new, a horror movie perhaps? like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper. the front cover is great, and the comment on the back is mesmerising - 'it will scare the crop out of you'...oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance.one of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these 'actors'. i think, no, i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these 'scarecrows', who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes. i used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night, but having seen this movie, i nearly wet myself (through laughing so much) just at the sight. i have seen scarier omelette's quite honestly, not mine though, i'm a dab-hand at cooking omelette's, and if anyone associates this movie with my omelette's, let's just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row.if anyone has any good corn (crop not pop) movies they can recommend, feel free to inform me. it's a great comedy if nothing else, ok it is nothing else. enjoy, but a little advice - before pressing the play button on your dvd player, throw it out of the window.

some teen agers go to an old deserted farm house left to one of them by their dead grandfather, unaware that there had been several murders there decades earlier because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest- couldn't the guy have thought of something better to sell his soul for? the man's grandson and his friends are set up to be the next sacrifice, for reasons which are never explained. the stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, the black guy with a white girlfriend, and the two lesbians have to do battle with three killer scarecrows- but, don't be tricked like i was, this isn't nearly as fun as it sounds. it's mostly just a lot of chit chat about ball kicking, dope smoking, and the lead actor complaining about never knowing his parents. the camera work is atrocious and shaky, maybe done on a hand held camcorder in some scenes, which maybe a good thing since the scarecrows look like they just came from some kid's birthday party, and apparently they could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows! some of the best movies i've seen have been these low budget, independent horror movies, but this one is just pathetic. the cast and crew seems to have just been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other, had never acted before and had no intention of acting again, and had a few thousand dollars (i can't believe this movie cost $130.000 to make) and a weekend of free time on their hands- even the lesbian skinny dipping scene is lame.i think it's amusing also, that as of this writing, there is a sequel to this film which no one has even bothered adding to imdb.* out of ****, and i only rate it that highly only because of the skinny dipping scene, no matter how lame it may be.

let's begin by acknowledging that there are arguably three types of horror films: good, bad, and utterly embarrassing reels that make the entire genre suffer in every way. dark harvest promises big with its artisan dvd cover, but rest assured that is where the show stops. following a grueling opening montage, we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script, extremely under qualified (even for a beginners film) acting, disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. seriously, could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain, or did they just think it was good enough for jason voorhees and michael myers , so it's good enough for us? well, it did not work at all to create a scary villain. at any rate, this is one of the movies that make you check your watch, sigh and curse your own gullibility. the timing in every scene is painful, and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it (come to think of it, i have seen better middle school stage productions, right down to the special effects). i'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters, frisbees, wind chimes.......i'd say "go see your yourself", but that would just be cruel.check out the rest of this production company's reviews and you'll find the same for every one of their movies. they claim to honor the contract between film and audience (i.e. please the fans) but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash (of which i am sure they saw very little for this). sorry people, the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or indirectly connected to this travesty. 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating. giving it even one makes me angry.

according to the budget information given on this web site dark harvest had an estimated budget of $130,000. where this money was spent i'm not exactly sure. let me see....costumes...no...location and sets...hmmm, think not....special f/x...not...acting lessons...ah, no. dark harvest tells the epic tale of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of west virginia. his girlfriend talks him into taking their friends up there to check the place out. once there our intrepid hero learns that his great grandfather used a unique method for getting his crops to grow and now it's revenge time. killer scarecrows out for revenge!!! ewww scary. well no, not really. we all know there have been some terrific movies made with very little money but this is not one of them. this film contains pretty much some of the worst acting and dialog i've ever seen. terrible clichés with terrible delivery. all in all do not be fooled by the half way decent cover and avoid at all costs. i'd like to give the film makers at least a d- for trying but i'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with that. grade: f

the first opening scene that lasted around five minutes showed the potential of becoming an instant classic, with moderit to good acting, good film, a story that keep the volume up, and an in the corner the of screen a spooky "did you see that!"(the scarecrow moves).after the quick set up of history that would come into the present, it was like someone else had written and directed the rest of the "film". the next scene is a basic outline of how the film goes downhill like a runaway truck. it looks like the rest was shot in video, with crappy "porn style actors", the set design was a lawyers office with practically nothing on the bookshelves or anything in the office at all. i remember only watching crap horror films for a chance of seeing some naked "teenage" girls, back then there weren't victoria's secret mags everywhere, and not watching for things that make great horror films of today like acting, terror, suspense, intregue, and so on.it took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die. when it did, me and and my friends were so shocked by the worst costume of a "monster" ever, we through our popcorn at the tv screen booing.

the movie starts off as we see a footage of a huge drought back in the 30's in america. then a short story is shown about a creepy - looking farmer elija who made a deal with satan , to get good harvest. elija hired young men to work in his garden , killed them , and used as scarecrows. he also fed the ground with their blood. some time after 2 cops come to visit him. one of them gets shot by elija , another one kills the farmer himself... after that , the present day is shown , and some guy named sean is told that he has an old farm left as inheritance. he decides to go there with some friends to see what's up. little did sean know that the next night is the "payback night".....as for me this movie had a good story for a horror flick , but low budget and poor special effects just ruined it. "dark harvest" is a perfect example of lazy film making. for example we see a scarecrow (a usual guy wearing a funny , cheap mask) chasing a girl. when he raises his hand we get to see a normal human skin below his glove, instead of some rotting flesh. the gore is not very impressive as well. there are some nasty killings by our "lovely" scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. surprisingly the acting is somewhat ok in this flick , or i better say its believable. some nude scenes are presented as well for the fans (even a lesbian scene) ,but those scenes don't save it.verdict : good music, good story, solid acting. but awful effects , cheap gore and plot holes slow this movie down. not really recommended.

bad script? check. awful effects? check. horrible actors? check. lame direction? check.after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, i placed my $4.28 on the line and rented this "film." my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch, what appeared to be (based on the box cover art) a horror movie. what i got instead was the worst film ever made. up until that point i had always declared "slumber party massacre 3" the worst film ever made.if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is, this is for you. if you don't want to lose $4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, steer clear of this garbage.an added note: i noticed a few of the "actors" come on here and post comments on the bulletin board. how can you brag about being in this film? you were all horrible. i mean really bad. if there was an american idol for actors, you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes.peace.sutter cain

okay, i'm sorry to the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst i've seen yet...first off, the acting was okay. it could of been better (especially in some parts), but it was "okay". then, there was the cheapest video camera (which they used). the violence was pretty good. if it were paced faster, it would be awesome, but they didn't (*sigh*)...scares. the scares were well written (in the script), but not well done. for instance...(spoiler here!) in the loft, a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark, bottom area of the barn house, then she gets it. the monster yanks her down and then you hear someones guts getting ripped out. the scares could have been better if the music wasn't ripped from a cheap horror sounds cd. the blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like that of "kill bill". k.b. pulled it off, because it was meant to resemble old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink....it's sad. the ripped up bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store. don't let the cover fool you, the costumes suck! my overall grade is a 3/10. if you are interested in independent movies, are easily satisfied, or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, go to blockbuster and see the horror of failure.

do not take this film seriously, rent it with some folks who want to play mystery science 3000, and you will probably laugh your butts off. the evil guys are so not scary, it's funny, it's like some dude from 7th grade with a sickle in a scarecrow get up. the acting is hilarious. i love the occasional self torture with a poor horror film and this really had me giggling. i recommend it on that basis. of course recreational drugs will enhance the experience. oh, there is a naked group swimming scene, that will allow for some star dust on the 5 star system. the token black male gets injured badly, but continues his joking as well as using the injured body part quite readily throughout. enjoy this complete and utter disgrace to films.

may contain spoilers. this movie was the worst movie ever. i couldn't even watch it all it was so bad. this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot. this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times. not even the gore in the film was good. the shootings were fake and the acting was worse. please do yourself a favor and skip this one. if you see it at the rental store then run the other way. there is nothing good about this film at all. if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head. if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow. i rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. that's how horrible this film really is. the worst movie ever.

now, i am going to do this without putting spoilers if i can. my cousin and i were renting movies the other weekend, and we stumbled across this, with the big freaking' scarecrow on the cover. it looked cool, so we rented it alongside kungfu hustle.wow... just... wow.to start off, the movie was horrible. now, the box art, opening scenes, and music was decent-to-well done, but the movie itself is horrendous. the acting is sub-par (sean, the lead, shows hardly any emotion and/or effort in his character), the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover (false advertising, perhaps?), and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling event.and trust me, i'm a wrestling fan. i know bad camera angles. and honestly, this is right up there with gigli and pootie tang. it's done so bad that it amuses me. it makes me laugh. so, somehow, this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me.but, to be fair, it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies, especially of the slasher genre. i recommend that people do watch this, just to get a good grasp of what to avoid.

pardon my spelling. this is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed. think evil dead * 1000. the acting is horrible, you can see the makeup line on a certain lady's face. there is a lesbian scene, which makes no sense at-all. and the ending, haha ohhhh the ending... be prepared to have your stomach hurting from laughter. now if you watch this film for more then 5 minutes and are still expecting something, take a look at your self, and ask what the hell is wrong with you. this is a very bad movie, meant to laugh at and enjoy for its pure silliness.don't forget to watch all the outtakes after the movie, you can see just how low budget the whole thing really was. all in all this movie is a rare gem in demonstrating the pure and udder lack of talent/care/ability/money/ and anything else you would ever need to make a successful film. but its definitely worth watching.

dark harvest is about a group of friends that go to a farm(it belongs to one of the friends relatives or something) for a getaway. but there are killer scarecrows lurking there(there was something about a curse in there too but i forgot what that was about).the acting in this movie is awful, i don't know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses. the script is the same story as the acting "awful"(this statement coming up is very obvious but..) if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out "okay".the directing stunk too, i see no potential in this guy's future. after all these negatives this movie still maintains a "fun" factor that bumps it up to a two. the last plus is they don't use cgi! my overall thoughts on this film are it's bad, real bad, but so bad it's "fun" so it gets a 2/10

i think there's a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters. it was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. the acting is very amateur. this movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored. the actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, with no "professionalism" whatsoever. should the director(s) and/or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies, i would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few (ok, many) classes on film-making and acting.

few videos in recent history have been as amateurishly produced as this one -- at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor. every frame of this film is a plaguerism of better films of the past. the word 'cliche' is given new meaning by a talentless writer/director who should reserve his imagination for lesser masturbatory efforts that don't victimize film viewers. assisting in the amateur night 'horror' effort is a number of less than capable technicians who contribute poor cinematography and laughable make-up and special effects. unfortunately, the one or two of the amateur actors in the film who display a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce.

this is possibly the worst of the worst. i am a huge fan of the horror movie industry and i can believe this movie was allowed to be made. the acting was juvenile and the story completely idiotic. the camera work was also juvenile. one scene that comes to mind is outside a store. it is nighttime and you can see the moon, yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall. there was no street light to be seen. one character gets gutted at one point, yet manages to resurface later after removing herself from a post. come on!!! it felt like i was watching a middle school play. i kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members off camera and mouth "hi mom". i can only give it two positive comments...it ended and it was good for a laugh. please do not rent this movie!!!!

i was in blockbuster and i saw a film called "dark harvest". the cover art looked great, the plot wasn't that bad, and the tagline (you reap what you sow) made the movie look pretty good. but i was dumb that day, because i did something i should have never done. i rented a "straight to video independent horror film" walking out with my much better rentals, i went home, popped dark harvest in the dvd player and it began. i figured i would watch the trailer after the film was done (bad idea) but went ahead and watched it anyway. now to the review.*possible spoilers* first off, the acting by the "kids" sucks, and the scene when the 2 (main characters) are talking, the lighting sucks, and the buildings even look fake! now they go to this house, where sean connel's (i think he's the main character, i don't care) relatives lived there. all of a sudden one by one, they all start getting killed by...(gasp) a killer scarecrow!!!! ahhh!!!!! the scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget, and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake it's hilarious. it makes dinosaur noises and everything! and then at the end...they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (that is red for god's sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar) and it pauses for a while and then.....(gasp) blows up!!!!!!save yourself some time, i'm telling you this movie sucks. if you need to pass an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is a+ fun compared to this disaster. it is quite funny though.overall grade: f if there was anything lower **f-** than i would give it that.

rent this only movie if you're in the mood for laughs (for sheer stupidity) , as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of kindergartners at a halloween party! the trouble is, there is too much gore for kiddies, so definitely don't put this in your vcr for the toddlers. it starts off with a little bit of promise, giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover, but then descends quickly into epic stupidity. the "killer scarecrows" are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the wizard of oz, but not quite as smart. if they'd only had a brain...? i got this movie for $1.20 at a local discount/close-out store and even so, i feel somewhat ripped off. i think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.

a young man, who never knew his birth parents, receives an old farm in an isolated section of west virginia upon the death of his natural father. he visits his property with a cross-section of potential victims including the comic relief black guy and a trendy lesbian couple. (hmm, will there be skinny dipping? take a guess.) unfortunately, the party comes to an end when the spirits of drifters killed by his evil great-grandfather and used as scarecrows come back for revenge. this film starts out well. an artful montage of depression-era photographs and phony newspapers set against a speech by fdr - this, i believe, is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow movie- establishes the mood. i developed some hopes for the film, which were partially realized. the story was serviceable enough. the setting was sufficiently bucolic. the photography was mostly in focus. the acting, while no great shakes, was slightly above par for horror movies in this budget range. the film might've actually worked within the narrow demands of the genre if the scarecrows were scary. but they weren't they looked cheap. they weren't frightening at all. the better the monster, the better the movie. these scarecrows wouldn't scare dorothy, let alone toto.

i've expected a comedy about the nva, but this is a parody. it shows the national army of eastern germany in a light that is not appropriate, and definitely not true.one can make a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts are not changed. even a comedy about the german kz is possible, as roberto benigni with "life is beautiful" has shown.the movie nva would be an "ok" comedy, because the jokes in it are overall ok. nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with it.the point is, that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the nva. a death machine that was ready to attack western europe along with it's friend the red army. an institution that used everything to get the utmost from it's soldiers. an army that marched into the cspr in 1968, and was ready to march also in poland to destroy the solidarnosc. you can't make a movie without showing the tiniest bit of evil, or would you make a parody about a kz,guantanamo or 9/11??? showing osama bin laden as a funny screwed guy? 90 minutes about a funny osama in a afghan taliban camp, where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the nva!

if you have been to the east of europe (or even in their armed forces), you might find this movie interesting. i don't know why calls this a comedy (sure, there are a few funny moments), but it is not a good movie if one of the orderly officers talks for 15 min about the achievements of socialism on a christmas dinner, and the officers in general act like funny oafs, the soldiers are running of the base to meet their girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the daughter of the commander. the east german army was known for its abusive and humiliating service of its conscripted men, and the comedy was basically not filmed on the facilities or with the equipment to make a good movie of the east german army and their time now gone by. despite this, some of the actors and actresses tried to act well, but it came out only in the roles they're known for from east german tv and some small films. i would not recommend this movie to anybody, it was basically boring and very cheap made.

i can imagine why he'd want to die, after starring in this rubbish. the man is incredible, but even sidney poitier couldn't save this tiresome morality play about racism in the old west. he and joanna going are both fantastic in this film: too bad the screenplay, co-stars, directing, and score couldn't match those two.

sex,drugs,rock & roll is without a doubt the worst product of western civilization. the monologues are both uninteresting and pointless in the rare monologue that captures the audience's attention it is quickly lost through overly long repetition and unnecessary additions (the hells angels at mcdonalds comes to mind) i guess bogosian's one man show needed some filler material to give a length that he thought justified the price of admission.i would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained of my blood than see sex,drugs,rock & roll again.

having seen just about every movie on record that a child of the eighties could have seen, this ranks at the very, very, very bottom of the heap of bad movies i have ever seen. it's depressing and just plain, painful to watch. nuff said.

this thing takes the horny teenager genre, very poorly respected to begin with, and completely flushes it down the toilet. the only people i would even consider recommending it to are teenage girls, for a "revealing" scene in a boys' locker room. and in the end i wouldn't make such a recommendation. to do so would be to contribute to the delinquency of a juvenile. an absolute piece of garbage with utterly no redeeming qualities.

well the film starts good, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid, when all the plot is about karen's( that was the name of the girl right?) pregnancy.the end of the movie it's really corny and the characters really dumb.i don't know who is more stupid, if the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or the boy for the way he was used for her.anyway my conclusion is this: definitely not the best eighties comedy, just another movie like many others with nothing special, they could do it better but they ruined it, if only the plot had take another way but they keep that pregnancy stuff and they definitely ruined, so final conclusion: i don't like.

i wrote an essay in 1981, the year i graduated high school called the "last american virgin." i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film. apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house. a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film. i was 18 years old & based the essay on experiences in my life. the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it. i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr.versace who gave me an a on my essay.i let it go & never did anything about it.i figured what comes around goes around.i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film. i just needed to get it off my chest, as i really never told anyone about it, except my closest friend & they agreed to keep it a secret.the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market, she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at. i guess thats what hollywood is all about, getting stories from wherever you can.it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though.ghost writer!

ya know, i have no idea how everybody else's teenage life was, but this does not reflect the folks i knew and hung around with let alone, myself. and just in case if you're wondering..no..we weren't pristine/clean cut/pat boone type teens. (if there was ever such a thing!!!!)look, i'm not saying being a teenager is easy. the better, well actually the best teen movie of this time is "fast times at ridgemont high". now those kids i knew and were as realistic as it got back then (and maybe now).this was crap. this was a low rent version of fast times and even then it didn't do much for me. it had a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend this, or even claim "this is how it was for teens back in 1982". i couldn't relate. the lead girl (girls) did nothing for me and please if they really wanted to keep their virginity, they would have, in which case, this film would not have been made. pure crap and a bad staple to be left behind as a time-capsule cinema for teens/young adults in the early '80's.

this film is bundled along with "gli fumavano le colt... lo chiamavano camposanto" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints. first, both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though "il prezzo del potere" does seem to have a better dub. personally, i always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. these dvd problems, however, are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.as for the film, it's about the assassination of president garfield. this is a major problem, as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland. in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield. he's missing the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this, i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes. plus, using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho!! he was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.in addition to the stupid casting, president garfield's death was in no way like this film. it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk, not garfield. garfield was shot in washington, dc (not dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. however, according to most experts, what actually killed garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. in other words, like george washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed president garfield was shot.because the film bears almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. why not also include ninjas, fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it?!?! aside from some decent acting and production values, because the script is utter cow crap, i don't recommend anyone watch it. it's just a complete and utter mess.

after receiving a dvd of this with a sunday newspaper, i hoped that it was not the usual duff films that are given away because no one would ever buy them. i was wrong. sheens acting is on par with that of a ten year old in a school pantomime production and the same goes for the majority of the cast. neill is satisfactory, but plays a russian and isn't helped by his hybrid northern irish/new zealand accent, and nor are the rest of the kgb characters, all of whom sound like they're in a cambridge footlights reunion. in fact, the only people with genuine accents are extras who supply an odd word here and there, helpfully letting us know at least where the hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash. the "espionage" factor is unimpressive for the most part and primarily consists of sheen faffing about in various ridiculous disguises whilst trying to blend into the background, quickly becoming not only boring but laughable. the plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. this could have been so much better.

rented the video with a lot of expectations, but it was a disappointment. the story didn't make sense, the plot was very weak and the special effects.. well, i think even i can do better with my home computer. sorry. missed a change here.

... brian? what the hell were you *on* when you signed to do this?i saw this recently at a festival, and it was greeted by howling laughter throughout. by the time the credits rolled, tears were streaming down the faces of many of the audience. the plot is a clunky melding of 'e.r.' and 'the x-files'; as cynically aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being sued. the sequences involving the abductions are hilarious- both yuzna's staging of the 'floating from the bed' and 'screaming mad george's pathetic plastic aliens drew gales of disbelieving, derisive laughter. limp, camp and stupid. my only hope is that it was an aberration- as awful as 'return of the living dead 3' was good.steev

now, let me see if i have this correct, a lunatic serial killer is going around murdering estate agents....okay...what's wrong with that scenario, i can live with that.what next, a slasher with tax inspectors butchered? traffic wardens sliced to death? are we supposed to feel any sympathy for empty headed and shallow, money obsessed property people? er...no.sadly, joking aside, it's just not a very well made film with poor acting and crude effects, the climatic scene is particularly silly. you can almost see the director shouting, 'action' to the stuntman as he falls through the glass of the window.as another reviewer quite rightly said, after starring in 'the fog,' this was the nadir of adrienne barbeau's career. therefore i was happy to see that she had rekindled it by becoming the voice of catwoman in the batman animated series, while watching the extras on the live action catwoman film. nb: not quite the awful film it's made out to be, by the way.this however is a bad film, think a poor episode of 'kojak' or 'streets of san francisco,' and you will get an idea of what is on offer here.

this movie was the slowest and most boring so called horror that i have ever seen. i would include a comment on the plot but there was none. i do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life.

lisa grant (adrienne barbeau) is a real estate agent who finds herself in jeopardy of getting killed by a deranged maniac who kills people in her profession who he feels make house prices too high. as motives go, this is pretty damn retarded. lisa's boyfriend happens to be a talk show host whom the killer keeps calling on-air. at first i was positive this was supposed to be a comedy or satire of some kind, but as the endless minutes drone on and on, i realized that it wasn't and the film was just grossly incompetent in every way, shape, and form. i'm just surprised that something this horrid wasn't directed by jeff lieberman (yea, email me some hate mail again, jeff you hack) anyway, back to the film, poor, poor barbeau, you can pinpoint exactly when her film career went down in flames and it all started here.my grade: f where i saw it: the movie channel

(some spoilers) dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man harry, darwyn swalve, out murdering real-estate agent all over the city of l.a because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties. looking like an extra from a clint eastwood "spaghetti western" harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get's very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted. this happens when a number of real-estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses, that he's staying at to their potential clients.joseph bottome stars in this bottom-of-the-barrel horror movie as radio talk-show host dr. david kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the kdrx survival line. dr. kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers,tracy, who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him.the real-estate killer gets to talk with dr. kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address, by keeping him on the line, but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the ladp. kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real-estate manager and agent the busty lisa grant, adrienne barbeau, who's office of sellers are harry's main victims in he movie. harry also gets to murder lisa's main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous barney resnick, barry hope, who threatened to put lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her. getting berney alone and with his pants down harry slices his head off while he's being entertained by one of his clients, a hooker, whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless barney. the movie ends with the deranged harry taking lisa hostage and having dr. kelly try to come to her rescue only to have det. shapiro (robert miano), looking like e hasn't slept in a week, pop out of nowhere and blow harry's brains out. harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the lapd, m16 cocked and ready, come on the scene.nothing in the movie "opean house" worked with the tension laughable to almost non-existent. even the hot sex scenes between dr. kelly and lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few,only two, of them and and sexy adrienne barbeau was a bit too underexposed, with not enough light and too much clothes on, in all of them.harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point, to dr. kelly on the phone and in person, about the high rents and real-estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in. you can sympathize with harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it.

best thing i can say about this porno-horror film is: boobies boobies boobies !beyond that, this film is made by some hindu/indian guy with some background in porn films or such .plot: talk-show host and girlfriend are stalked by a psychopath who is angry over the plight of the homeless and takes it out on, you guessed it, beautiful real-estate agent ladies ! (films like these are why the slasher films of the 80's got a rep for misogyny)this film is not really a slasher, but has the same sort of implausibilities and stereotypes: the dumb-ass cops, the villain is an old white male, and the women are busty babes . if you like porno-horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away . (adrienne fans will get to see her sagging breasts for a second or two)

at first i thought that this one was supposed to be somewhat of a comedy/horror when i had seen the body in the bathtub with the lady just standing there screaming over and over again but as the film proceeded on, it got more and more flat. the plot was silly with a man upset that the prices of real estate have gone up so now he dicides to call up some radio psyciatrist and babble out his fury because he has nothing better to do. then the law gets involved and tries desperatly to make us feel that they really care who the caller is and go out of their way to track this guy down. one suspect after another are accused. this movie is terrible and the slow moving love scenes of adrian b. and her husband are boring and made me just fast forward the movie. avoid it!

this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the "night gallery" show back in 1971. the episode starred sue lyon (of lolita movie fame) and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. she bolts out the door, the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. a total wasted effort.

low-rent version of ashley judd's double jeopardy. sutherland is too professional to be bad, but what was brigit fonda thinking?!? the penelope ann miller curse continues (think about it--when has she ever been in a good movie other than other people's money? and i'm not saying she's bad, but all of her movies fail in some way).

bridget fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of handsome hart bochner. one afternoon she comes home, calls him "honey", and quietly fixes him a drink, only to find that he's sulking. minutes go by while she compliantly puts up with his frowning silence. suddenly, he bursts into a rage, accusing her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason to do so, calls her the c word, slams her head against a cabinet, slaps her around, and winds up flinging her off the second-floor balcony, breaking her hand and a couple of ribs.she wakes up in the hospital where, it is revealed, she is deaf, although we notice that she reads lips perfectly. that avoids all the awkwardness associated with an asl interpreter or having her squawk words in a simulacrum of language.all right. let me just lay out the basic plot elements. this beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is beaten by her husband, misunderstood by her elderly mother, betrayed by her sister, has her bank account emptied by unknown hands, almost raped by a fat man who accosts her in a bar, is thought to have murdered her now missing husband, and is pursued by two cops (kiefer sutherland and steven weber), one of whom is interested only in justice while the other seems to dislike all women and is embarrassed by their presence. the end finds her standing alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of cash -- alone, tearful, but brave.now, a pop quiz. there is only one multiple-choice question. "this story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." not to sound sexist. one could as easily pose a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, escapes to exact revenge, and winds up with the woman he loves, whom he thought he'd lost long ago.the direction is functional and conventional. when fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, we see from her point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses looking down at her -- that is, at the camera -- an echo of every scene in myriad second-rate movies in which the gurney is being hurriedly wheeled down the corridor and people wearing starched white coats and festooned with stethoscopes hover over the camera.hart bochner has played a number of evil people in an interesting way -- some of the characters are stupid ("die hard") and some are rather more than plain rude ("and the sea will tell"). his virile handsomeness has a kind of evil tint to it. it would be too easy to cast him as a hero. nice, intentionally bland performance by steven weber as the dumb cop -- maybe the best in the film.bridget fonda is interesting too. her acting range is limited but it's on full display here. what makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty. she's like a high school prom queen. very feminine. of course she can't help it if she slithers around or moves her hands so gracefully. neither can she do anything about her nose. for most of its length it's perfectly normal and attractive but at its very tip there is a bump outward that follows the natural flare of her nostrils. the tip of that nose is full of intrigue.as for the movie -- pfui.

worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister. determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state, her peril increasing at each stop. chasing after her are the traditional 'good-cop' and 'bad-cop' pair of partners. one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home. this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her. all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some.wow! this was a bad movie. the lead acted as if she was tranquilized, the cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone else is as one-dimensional as can be. avoid this one at all costs.

the plot was really weak and confused. this is a true oprah flick. (in oprah's world, all men are evil and all women are victims.)

terrible. absolutely terrible. long, confusing and unrewarding. after about three hours of this painful mess the ending truly is the final nail in the coffin. not even the magnificent, sexy, beautiful goddess francesca annis can save this poor adaptation of agatha christie's work. the plot drags and drags and time goes by slowly and suddenly you realize that you don't even have any idea of what's going on anymore. by the end even with the usual explanation by the villain there's still a lot that's left unexplained and then it's over. a complete waste of time and without a doubt one of the worst adaptation's to bear the name of agatha christie.

i've just watched fingersmith, and i'm stunned to see the 8/10 average rating for the show.not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it seems character development was randomly applied.the actors were adequate, but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns, their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional. once this happens, the story really falls flat and becomes tedious.and just in case anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way, this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film.the end scene is disappointing and phoned in, and anyone who sat back and went "ohhh, so they were carpet munchers all along!", must have been out for the evening.two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy, none for the rest of it...

this lame harold lloyd sound film has nary a laugh in it, and makes one wonder if this lloyd is even the same one that made all of those delightful and hilarious silents.lloyd's boyish likability becomes fey and limp when we can hear him talk, and a sluggish, restrained pace replaces the zany antics of his silents. lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows up in china and then finds himself transplanted to contemporary new york city without a clue as to how life outside his chinese village works. he finds himself an unlikely victor in a mayoral election and quickly draws the ire of all the government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption. when he's framed in an attempt to bring him down, he decides to play just as dirty as everyone else, and stages a fake execution of every crook in nyc as a scare tactic. this darkly satiric ending feels out of place next to everything else in the movie, but it's the only part of the film that comes remotely to life. everything else is a dull bore.i don't like having to admit that a harold lloyd movie fails, because i like him so much, but i don't have a choice with this one.grade: d

if one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for harold lloyd. unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. he had a good voice which matched his image. moreover, from 1924 on, his "silent" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the fall frolic from the freshman and the monkey sequence in the kid brother). yet lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of welcome danger had ebbed. lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the glass character's enemy was not sound but the great depression. pre-depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. compounding this problem of character choice is lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. the cat's-paw fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. many film scholars believe that lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of fdr as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. we should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. demille had directed this day and age, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. we should also remember that america was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. tcp suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a "comedy" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in germany in that year. the production code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. the ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. for this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. ironically, the mere existence of tcp, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that fdr's america was secure enough to accept criticism. one sees no parallel criticism in hitler's germany, stalin's ussr, or mussolini's italy. but can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by dr goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. it posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor by any means necessary, and does so with good nature and fun. impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, chaplin's the great dictator. this latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. the great dictator produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the war: second, he never sold tcp to television. the post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.

while this isn't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then.harold lloyd plays ezekiel cobb, an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a missionary.he has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father's work.cobb unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld.they figure the bumbling ,stumbling cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich.lloyd isn't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films.he does a convincing portrayal of cobb with a reserved understated dignity.the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good.being made in 1934 the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren't nearly as mean as i've seen from other films from that time.although not close to being lloyd's best film ,this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as cobb.you won't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work.

me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie. bad idea. we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit, but our expectations fell extremely short. first of all, the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies. the movie started out slow for the first 1 1/2 hours(reminder, its about two hours long) and when it finally started to gain momentum, it sucked. plus, the plots were very hard to follow. it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order. the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality. sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality, but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other. if your a person who likes sick, twisted, unusual movies, then go for it. but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back. unfortunitly, no one told us that...

i'm thinking of some things for this movie: first, really is a very bad movie. this is really "superbad". the film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat... maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and bad acting the movie became boring and empty. my advise is don't waste 2 hours of your precious time. you have been warned. this is the first movie i rated 1 star at imdb.com... second, none of the characters are likable. you really don't care what happened to them... third, the villain is very easy to identify. the grandson kills his father, sodomizes the friend's son, get the maid pregnant, smothers his grandfather... like jt says, "if you like evil with no retribution, this is your movie". nothing more to say...

this movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and i will talk about why, but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault. not far into the movie oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier, and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film. i know many will argue that it's not that important in a kung fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genera i can't say that it's all that unusual, but that doesn't stop it from being completely tasteless every time i see it.what i will say in this movie's defence however is that it's somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts, or even action movie of any sort, that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind. oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police. the final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy-dog like devotion.whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not, one can't help but feel a little hopeful that oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over. this is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated. if only karate bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or by leaving it out all together, this would have been a much more interesting film.

like a terrible cancer raining out of the sky, i wandered into this crock on some movie channel the other night. being a fan of bad movies, and actively engaging in the purchasing and viewing of said bad film, i was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely terrible looking action movie coming from modern times. after that wore off though, i found my hands inexplicably turning against me, grabbing at anything in range and stabbing about my head and neck. something sinister was in that tape...err...where was i...anyway this ranks among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of film i've run across. william forsythe can't play more than one character, and that character is always a walking joke. even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny (ala deuce bigalo) he's laughable in the wrong way. erika eleniak is much the same, having starred in her fair share of terrible movies and done terrible jobs in all of them, she doesn't fail to help scum up this one. classic b-movie villain guy andrew divoff does a respectable job but barely even has any scenery to chew on. even reliable standby for b-movie action daniel bernhardt fails to deliver anything bordering on entertainment. as for the film's own merits, the plot is lame, the script, just like the action and the plot movement, is both dull and...well, stupid, for lack of a better adjective(lord knows they didn't put any effort into it, why should i?).anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones, and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them, but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most bad movie tolerant and simply feel so inclined as to test your mettle. before you do though, take it from me, this one isn't even terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike say...some of the more ludicrous italian zombie films). a fan of b-movie action would be much better off checking out most any of bernhardt's other films, or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter. america simply is not the place to go to for action it seems, especially not now. if you have a craving, check out anything from over the seas, films like heroic duo or the slightly less normal hakaider(along with anything else in the awesome keita amemiya's cannon) will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere, especially here.

i'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a b movie on its way to obscurity. the shock to me, though, is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film. erika eleniak, never anything you'd call a thespian anyway, seems to have morphed into anna nicole smith (in her big period). daniel bernhardt - i almost shed a tear. he's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess, as seen in the bloodsport series (also b movies but, if you like martial arts, eminently watchable). here, he is a shell of his former self - sure, he's older, but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested ... i just don't get it. don't these people invest? william forsythe is another "heavy" that i've always liked, but his last several roles are what you would call "mailing it in". i'm not going to even mention mr. reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway, nothing more. the only winner is andrew divoff, as usual a creepy, evil, pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! this is a movie you watch for laughs. there's nothing else to it.

ok, imagine that every state in the us, nay, every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage. imagine, also, that a monkey-trapper's camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully tarmac'd, perfectly straight road leading up to it. imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk, then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office. a world where two nine-year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining. this is the world this movie is set in.on top of that, it's one of the most cliché-ridden pieces of excrement it's been my misfortune to witness in many a year.i liked it. :)

i've been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in south east asia over the last three years . apparently it's on the thresh hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic . just thought i'd mention this in case you haven't got round to writing your will yet .i'd also thought i'd mention it since i was watching something called carriers tonight which wasn't about naval warfare but opens with a scene that's a cross between outbreak and an episode of the x files i saw many years ago . i thought i'd be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening carriers descends into a cheap and cheerful tvm and like every other tvm you'll see the lead characters are female , one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children . it goes without saying there's a sick child subplot too what is irritating about the tvm format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema . there's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this - and just about every other tvm ever made - was made for an essentially female audience

i've watched the first 15 minutes and i can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel. judith light's charactor (an officer) has her hair down past her shoulders! one of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap! no - there was no military advising them on this movie. even an ex-military enlisted could have assisted here.

how can you make a joke about mafia? it is not the kind of subject to laugh at! a near movie cannot make me laugh, because i am comparing it to jane austen's mafia!. mafia! wasn't a good movie but hoods is really worse! in mafia!, there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three...that make you smile. not too bad actors but very bad scenario!! we sure prefer something serious like the godfather. i give it * out of *****.

no idea how this is rated as high as it is (5.8 at the time of writing) but this movie was absolutely horrible. the acting wasn't entirely bad but it really had no point whatsoever and the overall quality was poor. its obviously a b movie (or a c if such a thing exists) and it looks like it was made over a weekend at a friends house or something. im all for low budget movies and i generally watch any i come across but this one is really really bad. i mean like "the fanglys" bad. i don't know what else to say but trust in this as i have indeed sat thru this horrible horrible movie and i can save you the effort... don't bother. seriously... just don't.

silly and violent thriller that is a rip - off of 'deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence. the plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry. this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way. it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this.

i've seen comments from turkish people (which i'm not) saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays turkish life. all i have to say is... turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, that is exactly what this movie was to me. if i were turkish, i think it would have had a greater impact. but if you're not from turkey, i would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this."distant" seems to lag on forever. many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose. i don't understand the director's objectives in even including many of the scenes. it is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment, and friends in making the movie...well guess what? it shows. it looks low budget. the acting is poor. if it's a cultural thing then so be it. i just don't understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. it's unbelievably boring.

"hoods" doesn't deliver the goods. this half-baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast, including joe mantegna, kevin pollack, joe pantoliano, jennifer tilly, and seymour cassel, along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies, but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one. writer & director mark malone, best known for writing "dead of winter" for "bonnie & clyde" director arthur penn, has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss louie martinelli (seymour cassel) dispatching his son angelo (joe mantegna of "house of games") to whack carmine dellarosa. it seems that a rival mob fire-bombed one of pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) and martinelli wants payback. trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who carmine dellarosa is. in any other mob comedy, such a complication might be amusing, but here is just plain flat. angelo and a carload of wiseguys, including his best pal rudy (kevin pollack of "deterrence") spend half of the time trying to find out who carmine is. neither rudy nor angelo want to perform the hit, so they track down a crazy mob hit-man charlie (joe pantoliano of "bad boys") to do the dirty deed. before they can convince charlie to make the hit, they have to locate him, and charlie's slutty wife mary (jennifer tilly of "bound") reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital. our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break charlie out. about half of the movie is over before they discover that carmine is a kid in short pants (vincent berry) who is bland and harmless. indeed, carmine has the only decent line in the movie. as our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business, carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him. charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot. instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. meanwhile, after charlie decides not to shoot carmine, the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds. angelo and he struggle over the automatic. the pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, goes off, and blows a hole in rudy's chest. now, keep in mind that rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place, and angelo and he argued over the wrong-headedness of the hit. so rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound, while angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. talk about a dull death scene. angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't execute orders. there is a flashback subplot about angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into angelo's reluctance to pack a gun.there is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending. things gets worse, and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense, you'll see what i mean. the comedy is largely laugh-less. good actors wallow in sketchy roles that aren't even funny. perhaps director malone was trying to do another comedy like "the gang that couldn't shoot straight." if he was, he missed by a mile. big-breasted jennifer tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with mantegna, but she doesn't do much of anything else. she's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked. a paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. initially, i had hoped that this might be a "ransom of red chief" knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts, but no such luck here. of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid, but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution.i actually bought this movie on a canadian dvd labelsevilleand it contains only the most basic special features. if you hate previews that give away the plot, don't watch the trailer. if you ever meet joe mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner. it is neither hilarious nor dramatic. there are no quotable lines, and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic. the seville dvd presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning.

bad, ambient sound. lots of shuffling. loooong pointless scenes. eg: guy sees interesting woman in lobby. manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package. says nothing. stares creepily. more shuffling and other irritating ambient noise. wait. wait. wait. guy says nothing. woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so. manager comes back with package. guy goes up to the apartment with the package.another example: the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv. more ambient noise and shuffling. wait wait wait wait. guy wanders off to bed. if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie, you get to watch them watch tv again later.if you want a story, any dialogue, entertainment, or a well crafted film, look elsewhere.

jefferey dahmer was one sick guy. there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said, except that the many documentaries, and films made about him are probably better than this one. it's ridiculously cheesy. it's so cheesy, a guy who posted the whole film on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laugh.carl crew (who's he?) stars as serial killer jeffrey dahmer, who's killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with, a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with, and eat.i didn't bother to watch the whole film through. it's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught. and since this film was made in 1993, one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate, the death of dahmer isn't shown. but it probably would've been as cheesy as this cheese-fest.1/10

***possible spoilers***i've read up on dahmer a little and saw the new dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time. this movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings, too little on dahmer himself. the film called "dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.i did not find the acting to my satisfaction, it had a certain amateur feel too it, especially the probation officer. it also seemed as if the dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. but i might be wrong about that.what annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show "the real deal" about what he did anyway. that is ok - but what i then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while dahmer was out getting beer, was not depicted being naked, since that is also how it happened. it's not a big deal, but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out. what wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was dahmers sexual obsession with the dead. again, i don't mind they didn't show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow.conclusion: i think the really good dahmer film is still to be made, a movie that incorporates not only dahmers crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. i think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all. this movie was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.4/10

"the secret life" starts with the worst possible narrative intro: "the crimes committed by jeffrey dahmer are too horrible to make a film about...". okay, so what are you suggesting? that we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody, anyway? and they were right, too! the film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all. although i think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of dahmer's crimes being too horrific. basically, "the secret life: jeffrey dahmer" is just one sequence repeated over and over again. young, pitiful and mentally confused jeffrey picks up victims (always males, as he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is. this gets boring really quick and even the admirable performance by unknown actor carl crew can't save this movie from being a total dud. still, this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled "dahmer" that got released in 2002.

this movie has been done before. it is basically a unoriginal combo of "napoleon dynamite" and "sordid lives." there are some funny bits, but otherwise it is a cliché bore. it is a good first film attempt and the director (who also stars in and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise. but the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original. i swear i had heard some of the lines in other films. however, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. it is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst. the main character seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural texas so no saccharine, coming out drama here!

i wasted enough time actually watching this chore of a movie, i don't want to waste more writing a big review. not once did i so much as crack a smile. all the jokes were boring, forced and lacked any kind of wit. i kept saying, "wheres the punchline?" almost every single character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the situations were clichéd and half the time there wasn't even any kind of solution. things just happened to get to the next scene. for the life of me i can't understand how this got as many good reviews as it did. if you like clunky acting and poorly composed film making fat girls is the movie for you.

the premise of the film was very promising - sort of a gay napoleon dynamite type of film. and to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall. the script and dialog felt like a local sketch production, full of clichés and scenes that were predictable.however, there was enough that was amusing, that i stuck around to see how it finished, since there were hints that something special happens at the end. but it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt, almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits.overall, it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable...

"fat girls" is among the worst films within the indie gay genre.the premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small tx town. his only kindred spirits are the other village hs misfits: the class 'fat girl', a naïve immigrant from cuba, and the sensitive drama teacher. so far, interesting. in theory, this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across america and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor.unfortunately, rather than a nuanced dramedy, ash christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. the result is a cast of unlikeable, derivative, two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. sabrina (fink) is a quasi-goth bitter navel-gazer. she is such a prickly, unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. the chemistry between her and rodney (christian) registers zero. this may have been bad casting, but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. consequently, one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond, what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the story.sabrina's newfound boyfriend, rudy (de jesus), and rodney's mother judy (theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant/nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent "comedy" ever made within the realm of tv or film. judy is the born-again obsessed with jesus- talk and big hair. just when you thought the tammy faye thing had been done to death, christian inserts a scene where judy's mascara is running with her tears! is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?in addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor, there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. rodney considers himself a "fat ugly" loser. however, he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock/hunk, ted (miller). although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone, just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.rodney finds an object for his affection in bobby (bruening), an exotic transplant from england. against all believable odds, the lad not only happens to land in this tiny tx hamlet, but is conveniently openly gay to boot. like sabrina, bobby is an icy, angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal. much to his delight, rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar, where bobby claims to be the dj. upon arrival, the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. this is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. as tiny as the town is, they have openly gay students at the high school? a secretly bisexual football captain? lesbian moms? a gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men, no less)? apparently, the place is not so backwater after all.ten years earlier, todd stephens' "edge of seventeen" covered nearly the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching, and humorous film.

i checked this out at the vancouver international film festival and was not impressed.the only area of the film i enjoyed was the commentary on film-making. for the most part, this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical (i don't say that in a complimentary way, however) and just silly. it was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life, which may sounds intriguing in some films, but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse.my criticism of this film is not upon the actors, rather the story itself. i found it boring and narcissistic. i wanted my money back, but considering it was a film festival, that wasn't about to happen.

on halloween a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin for a head. bad acting compromised mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one baaaaad. b-movie queen linnea quigley looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films can't help this one. pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good halloween horror film and rent "night of the demons" which also stars ms. quigley.

i can not believe i even wasted a netflix rental on this complete piece of crap. how long did it take to make this film? 15 minutes? on a budget of what? fifteen bucks? i can spend a few hours with my sony camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous lump of bile, and it's even available on dvd!?!! a very sad thing to think classics like the stepfather have not been released on dvd but this chunk of steaming dung makes it to the format. here's hoping my rating of one one one one makes the overall (already) pathetic rating of 2.5 go down.

jack-o (1995) was a really bad movie, we are talking snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value whatsoever, no budget, no gore, z-grade actors etc etc, this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn't have been made!!! the only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew linnea quigley was in it, and sure enough, she does her obligatory nude shower scene, which is lovely yes.but as for the film itself........ i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had no desire at all to finish it, it's just bigtime lame ok.i love horror movies, i'm an avid fan, a massive fan, i love low budget horrors, i love it all, but i hated this rubbish, so i think that will tell you all you need to know about "jack-o".i give this movie 2/10, the "2" is for the 2 minute linnea shower scene, the movie itself is a total zero!!!!

looking for something shocking? okay fine... the imagery is that. that's about it. this film attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being annoying. i am not quite sure if the director's purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience, or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore, sex and violence. i am thinking that it was probably the first...but in the failed attempt..it simply ended up to be a piece of artsy garbage with lots of blood, some obnoxious characters, and an over reliance on religious symbolism. if you're looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphor...have at it. if you are looking for a gore flick that will make you queasy and uncomfortable... here you go... if you are looking for a film that will irritate you to no end because you realize that in the end, the message was stupid...the movie was stupid... and you will never get those minutes of your life back..this is surely the film for you!

i rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy.unfortunately this is not one of those movies. i am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. it is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life. that is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it.here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the us in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. and when i say evil - i mean evil. all white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. it would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious.the portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. the immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and ouies the world over. i couldn't help but laugh when i saw these "field workers" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon. a little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie evoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.

what should have been a dramatic tale of life on the river murray turns out to be a silly, soppy romance about an english refugee (sigrid thornton with aussie accent) who falls for the larrikin first mate (john waters) of a paddle-steamer.the first half of this four and a half hour mini-series shows some promise, but it soon falls flat as it becomes predictable and thin. some real verve and spark was needed in the plot to give the movie some life. gus mercurio's early exit didn't help as his character seemed to me to be the only interesting one.perhaps the longer t.v. version has more depth, because this video translation certainly lacked it.sunday, june 27, 1993 - video

okay, i agree with all the barney haters on this site. i think barney and his friends are all ugly looking and obnoxious and the show is very lop sided and unrealistic.but the thing that ticked me off the most is how barney presented gays, lesbians and bisexuals on his show when talking about same sex parents and relatives. that wouldn't be so much of a problem if the creators of this show didn't use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. i mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink, and not all lesbians are ugly and manly looking with a bosom that sags to their abdomen. as a bisexual female, i just think this is terrible for a children's show. if this were south park, i wouldn't mind it, because south park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. a lot of people who watch barney are little kids or handicapped people who can't usually distinguish fantasy from reality.and now that i think about it, barney sort of comes off as an ugly gay stereotype himself. let's see, he doesn't have a girlfriend, he's pinkish colored and wears clothes with sequins (yes, it's true) on it. if you claim to be for the rights of gay and bisexual individuals, then stop making a mockery out of them in front of people who don't know any better. if barney went black-face and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the show would be pulled off the air before you know it.i give this show a negative one out of five. don't show your kids such hateful crap. there are children's shows out there that are so less insulting.

i was a little to old for this show i was 6 when it first came out. first off when i was a young child there were a few children's shows that were on sesame street which i did watch and learned from, but other than that there wasn't much else. my cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter. barney was a very big part of what they watched. when i first saw this show i told my grandmother how it doesn't teach anything just uses magic to fix everything. i was 9 at the time, how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a tv show. more and more that i saw or heard what the teachings of barney were the more and more i told people how bad the show was. the funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80's which was me by the way. they agreed and said the same thing as i did. the sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw. its not cheating its creative, its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to. its o.k to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone. lets be honest with ourselves, barney is out to make money not teach children anything. the more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it. children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better, second barney put on a show and parents bought it. i never believed that tv could affect people the way barney does. if you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers, do not let them get involved in this show. barney is like smoking once is to much, smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought

when i was a younger(oh about 2)i watched barney for the first time, and liked it. but, back then i didn't exactly have a brain, either. and now i look back and see what a horrible show "barney" really is: first of all, everything on that show is creepy. barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about "imagination...."(*shudders*) b.j.(i know what your thinking about his name.)is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be "supposudly" cool. but in fact, he is the exact opposite. after watching a few episodes with b.j. dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap, and making a few no-so-funny jokes, i wanted to scream. baby bop-oh-oh-god!(*vomits*)oh-oh-oh-anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever. she is a green triceratops(it's a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. her remarks of "hee-hee-hee" and barney's praises cries of 'super-deeee-doooper", make it hard to sit through each episode, as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners.and that, my friend, is what makes this show truly horrible.

i didn't watch this show that much when i was little. and i think i only watched 1 episode which was about railroads i believe because i liked trains and still do. even then i thought it was a baby show. i mostly watched arthur. the songs are pretty weird too. and i don't think it's that educational either. they just sing some dumb nursery rhymes. this is a dumb show, any adults who like it are crazy! if you want some good kids shows, watch something like arthur, mister rogers neighborhood or even better pee-wee's playhouse. i thought sesame street was boring when i was little but even that is better than barney. trust me, this show is pretty dumb, there are other kids shows that are better than this one. i can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people don't like this show. now there are some mature people. i hope they take this show off air soon.

being a child of the 1980s, i grew up with numerous educational as well as diversionary programs (or both), and continue to learn so much from them now that i admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. after learning that sesame street, to name the best example, was not solely responsible for the fact that i could read at an adult level before i could walk, it only increased the level of disgust i feel not only towards the lyons corporation and its product, but those who defend them, too. as if i had faith in those we assign to protect us or our children to begin with, the fact that barney & friends still pollutes our airwaves after more than a decade later is a discredit not only to the fcc, american commerce, and its makers, it is a discredit to all of humanity. in a world where i can be harassed without recourse by the police, welfare services, and child protection agencies simply for being born different to those in power, yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drivel into my home uncontested, you have to ask what is wrong with people.you see, in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone. not only are our attempts to make our children more normal, more alike, more think-alike, potentially devastating, what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play, too. so the question becomes one of what barney is teaching our children to be normal. apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short, other shocking things we are shown on the barney show include barney molesting children. the issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society, and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not, but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topic.so far i have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons barney himself presents. adding to the problem is the children shown on the show. i use the word children loosely here, as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen. yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme. fourteen year olds react to barney and his proposed situations in the exact same way as five year olds. experts in childhood and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to. adults on the autistic spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flat-out ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with barney that would make fourteen year olds cry. as irreverent and sick as shows targeted toward the elder-child market such as you can't do that on television were, they stamp all over barney by demonstrating that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways, so too do different people.so in response to mdmireles1295, i have to say that i hope like hell they do not have children. for every time i see a parent showing their child this drivel, it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse. and i speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse. they might sing about manners, loving, caring, or sharing, but the examples they show are not only so lopsided as to be the opposite of educational, they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous, as the light triton has already pointed out. the kind of lessons children learn from barney are that people do not vary, feelings must be suppressed at all costs, and rules are entirely arbitrary. when compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy, it still boggles the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and yank this trash off the air. if a parent did to their child what barney does around the world, they would face criminal charges.hence, i gave barney my favourite two out of ten score that i give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value. in a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children, it has no place.

barney is that idiot dinosaur who (unfortunaltely) didn't go extinct with the other dinosaurs many eons ago. instead he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100% worthless and/or extremely dangerous: that is "strangers are your friends you haven't met yet!". the reason why i say he's evil? well, on youtube, there's a video of a barney song about toy balls. when it's played backwards, it comes out as "we'll all come hang you! let's stab the knockers!". don't believe me? see it for yourself! i also read on another review that they are now reading out pc folklore and fairy tales. now that is just stupid with a capital s! i mean, really! anyways, i don't recommend letting your kids watch this filth as it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends (as said before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food, being an individual is taboo, magic can solve all of your problems and heaps of other ridiculous crap.

ok, i could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget.first there was linnea quigley and rachel carter. actually, the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch, and watch i did.the only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road. now, i didn't know this beforehand, but i saw an orange county car tag and said, wow! this was shot in florida.i was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid, but that was really it. the killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame, with the exception of the biker.if you want to see quigley and carter, ok, but return of the living dead will give greater thrills.

i am not lynne bates my names is ritichie but lynne is my mum i'm just using her account! barney and friends, (or barney, as it is called here in england) is the corniest show ever. i never really liked it, it had been about for 3 or 4 years when i was born, so it was nothing new. my friend, however, loved this dildo of a show. i was about 6, and i was at his house once, and he had a barney vhs tape playing on the tv. i turned the power off, and he burst into tears. grow up its a talking dinosaur for christs sake! anyway, i happened to catch the barney movie on tv later that year, and i loved it. i got the vhs of it a few months later, and i wore the tape out i loved it so much! i gave that tape away a few years ago now, but i loved it at the time. but the show! my god the show was bad! several kids fell victims to paedophiles because of this butt plug of so called entertainment! never again, never again! its not just me who hates barney, either! 85% of all the comments on this show are bad, and and just look at the amount of you tube poops and videos that take the mess out of barney are on you tube! and don't get me started on blow job bj! why the hell would the producers dare give a character such a sexual name! yet another subliminal message in a kid's show! and that baby bop is the worst thing since osama bin laden! all in all, i give barney and friends minus 1000 out of 10!

barney and friends is probably the worst kids show that i have ever seen. it teaches kids nothing, the songs are corny, it is not educational and the characters are just plain agitating. i am not one to disagree with those who hate the show. honestly, i have seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people. this show contains no educational value or age-appropriate educational material whatsoever. more reasons why i dislike this show is because of the crappy plots, cheesy dialogue, horrid special effects and the abysmal story lines. besides, it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. saying that is a "model of what preschool television should be",as expressed by yale researchers dorothy and jerome singer, is a load of crap. they don't know what they're talking about. i would never recommend barney to anyone. te reason why some kids keep crying for or get addicted to junk is because of this show poisoning the minds of children everywhere. for people(parents/children) who seek real preschool mater, switch over to nick jr. and watch "super why!" instead. it's far more better than this turd and five tv once had the nerve to put it on "milkshake" but thankfully took it off. i highly advise everyone to keep far away from this show as possible. parents, i highly advise you to keep your kids as far away from this show as possible. they'll thank you later.bottom line: don't bother wasting your valuable time with this stupid show. it's utter garbage. -10000000000000/10. grade: z. avoid like the plague!thanks for reading.

that someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible. that it actually aired on television and advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is mind boggling. this stomach-wrenching excuse for kid's programming is almost too vile to comment on. i've burned -- yes burned -- any barney tapes that people have given my son. to find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. and where, tell me where, do they get those smarmy kid actors? have their parents no sense? those kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers. geez. the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb.

barney is just awful. as many of the other reviews on this show say. i'm not one to disagree with them (i won't). because i hate this show just as much as they do. they use kids that look like they're in sixth grade, cheesy plots, horrid dialog and really crappy special effects. not to mention that big purple dinosaur himself. he makes every other kid show look like award winners (sesame street has won awards, that i know about).please, just watch sesame street, thomas the tank engine or even the teletubbies. avoid both, this and its movie (which i also reviewed). they are both extremely crappy and are inappropriate to anyone (even little babies).

ok, when i was little (and i mean like 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) barney was one of my favorite shows. i then grew out of it and threw all my old barney tapes away. so one day as i'm flipping through channels, i see that barney now takes place in a caboose, and i thought "um huh is this the right show?" once i realized it was, i freaked. why did they change the show's setting from a school to a caboose? ever since then, the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason i'm giving it a 2 is a) because i'm nice, b) because of riff, and c) because in the old times the show was tolerable. now i just hate it. hate it.2/10

barney and friends...the dora the explorer of the 1990s.ok, i'll admit it. as a kid, barney was my ultimate hero. i had my barney plush toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape. maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mind-numbing.however, by the time i turned 7, i started to hate barney. everyone at school would dis barney, and i went along with it (mainly because it was funny) and it's what little boys do. but a few years later, i discovered something else about barney that i will never forget.a person known on the imdb as angel_meiru did an essay for school, explaining the dangers of watching barney, and he or she posted it in the message boards. a lot of those dangers made sense.barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school. he is supposedly educational, or so sheryl leach (barney's creator) says, but really, all i can remember him teaching me, is that magic can solve anything, which is not true.to end off this comment, i'd like to tell you a little story. there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney. one day, he was alone, when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him. i don't know the outcome (but it's safe to assume the child died) but why was he abducted in the first place? because he watched the barney and friends episode titled "a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet." 0/10

"i hate you, you hate me, barney stole your suv with a great big bunch and a kick from me to you wont you say you hate me too?" "jingle bells batman smells grandma had a gun shot barney and made him pee and now there is no more barney the moron" now why the heck would come up with a idiotic show like barney ???????? so what i'm saying is barney is a retard from the underground world? and the kids on this show are like 12 years old. if i were them i wouldn't believe this stupid idiot called barney.now producers why do you believe this crap that barney says? they are always happy. that is stupid.they should be sad sometimes. am i right? bottom line barney is so stupid who watches that ugly creature.

i don't get it. i just don't get it. "barney and friends" has been lambasted by millions through the years, and i will admit, i was one of those lambasters. any child who watches this show doesn't realize that what they're watching is just a piece of trash. barney is very annoying, and very selfish. add baby bop, and it gets even worse. add b.j., then you have a very creepy television nightmare. then, you get the children. they're old enough to know what barney is trying to teach them! what are they doing there in the first place? it would be funny if barney and his friends appeared on the jerry springer show. that would certainly be one of the wildest moments in television history! even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, as we have seen less and less of the more informational and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and the 1980s. what a big difference a selfish son of a gun makes. when this show leaves pbs, a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but a huge dent will have been made in the annals of television history. a message to barney himself: you may not realize it, but your days are numbered.in a nutshell, there are other choices. better choices.

barney teaches kids nothing!!! here are some 3 reasons why you shouldn't let you kids watch this show: 1. barney teaches kids that we should think exactly like each other to get along.2. barney teaches kids that you shouldn't be sad, and if you feel sad, eat lots of ice cream!!! 3. if you make people pity you they will give you what you want when you want it.barney is just a fat doll who told kids strangers are your friends. he should not be trusted. and he is high every day!!!, he constantly giggles!!!! do not watch this show!!!!!!!!!!! your kids will thank you when there older

okay, you hippies are probably wondering what i have against an "education" and "informative" show like "barney"? well, i have a lot of hate against it for these reasons:1. it teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral. no one on the show has a personality. everyone dresses alike, talks alike, acts alike and dances alike. even in the episode called "being an individual", kids try to tell barney about what they like and everyone on the planet should do what i like. do you wanna teach your kid that being an individual is wrong?2. "a stranger is a friend,you haven't met" episode. while seemingly harmless, the show's producers soonfound that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children. in fact, several young barney-lovers from across the u.s. fell victim to pedophiles, who were using the show's friendly message to lure children away from their parents. the episode has since been pulled, but the damage had been done. so called "innocent" mistakes in programming, like this one, clearly show why parents need to watch television with their children.3. if your not happy all the time, you are a bad person. no one seems to show any other emotion but happiness, no matter which situation they are in. if the child's parents get mad or sad for some reason, the child may think of mommy or daddy differently. not a good message at all.4. magic solves everything! seems like every problem is solved by magic. at least in shows like "fraggle rock", it teaches us that magic can backfire at it is best to solve problems on your own. does barney teach this? no, of course not. there has to be magic in there. and the problem is, a lot of two year olds cannot tell fantasy from reality, and might think their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, yet become confused when they cannot use magic and think they are weird. another boner pulled again.5. barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. he has even specifically said that "stealing is okay if the person you steal from doesn't mind". kids can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. this is not something that preschoolers need authority figures to tell them.6. "if i just have the right thing, i can solve all my problems." whenever the kids have a problem, barney gives them whatever they need to solve it. the message being sent here is "don't try to think to solve this! it's too much work, and the solution probably wouldn't work anyway. just use this." because of this, children could stop thinking through things (barney said it was too much work) and become dependent on the "right" object. (the right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine...) this is obviously a good message for the barney marketers, but it's not good for preschoolers.7. the message that cheating is okay. in another episode the children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut on a spoon without dropping it. one child puts peanut butter on his spoon, and easily wins. the child is then rewarded for his creative thinking, when the child in fact bent the rules, and changed the game so that he could win. this teaches that cheating is good, you win and people think that you are creative, when in real life you will often be disqualified, or worse, and severely disliked by other competitors who played by the rules.8. do the kids in this show eat anything else besides cakes, cookies and candy? that teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food, despite barney's so called "health food" song. other than that, everyone in the show eats junk food. no wonder there are so many obese kids in america and europe.and finally....most other kids' television shows teach creative problem solving well, without having to resort to "magic". barney could also have done that but instead decided to use the method that was a) best for the marketers and b) took the least time and money for scripts. it's a blatant sellout that shows just how little the lyons group actually cares about children.that is my rant for you all.

warning might contain spoilersi just sadly spent 5 bucks on this movie on amazon and i wish i never spent it. i have never seen suck horrible special affects, or acting. i mean jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something u could buy at a halloween store or make yourself. the acting is just horrible especially sean kelly i mean come on he is so pathetic with his little lines "come get me pumpkinman" low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid. i mean the movie is so awful they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shut it off low. i think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted. i mean come on that looked so fake and the dummy i could buy that at any halloween store or make it myself. well i recommend not watching this cheesy movie cause it will be time you will never get back.

spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype of punks. this documentary is biased and guided, not objective. the cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview may be used to take the spoken word of interviewees out of context. when you watch the film, the sticking idea that comes from the interviews of the punks is that they are pretty dumb. band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all. i highly doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what spheeris was creating or saw the final product would allow themselves to be included in the project. this film puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintelligent and simple-minded. spheeris' film should not be taken as a representation of the l.a. punk scene. if you want to see a good punk documentary watch "another state of mind" featuring youth brigade and social distortion.

this is a film with a lot of potential, well done and acted, with a rather week and inconsistent script. a young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment, because the husbands flat on top of the workshop where he cuts up stolen cars is aggravating their son's asthma.husband ends up in jail when an ex pat's stolen car is traced to his shop, ex pat ends up being kind,generous and naive shmoe(and rather cardboard and we learn next to nothing of him ), but ends up with the girl, who "trades up" despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband. i expect this film to be successful in czech, where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise - "them ex-pats may have money, they may even get our women, but they're old, soft and our women want to be satisfied,we may be poor, but ... . now if only could evzen keep marcela satisfied so she would not need to play with herself, or if he already had an existing family in italy ... but that would complicate things.

seeing this movie in previews i thought it would be witty and in good spirits. unfortunately it was a standard case of "the funny bits were in the preview", not to say it was all bad. but "the good bits were in the preview".if you are looking for an adolescent movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie.

frankly i met real han su ying before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why can't hollywood get nancy kwan instead .... at least its more true to the story...cos for goodness sake...dr han su ying is chinese i know cos i have meet her in personand looking at the whole cast....so few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of baloneyits just like another movie i know of ' the conqueror' imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as genghis khan!!!!!and to make matter worst ....how on earth can a man born an bred in mongolian steppes come up with a alabama southern accent??? !! and a cheap imitation of anything asiangood griefi am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin luther king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel showwould love to see thatand laugh the whole roof off !!!cheers

this film looks great, and that's about where my praise ends. "love is a many splendored thing" came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like "kiss me deadly." as a trend toward smaller, socially conscious films like "on the waterfront" and "marty" established itself in the mid-50's, other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging, pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade, and "love" is one of the latter.this is the kind of 50's movie where the technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. i never want to hear the theme song again, as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime, and i certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill, ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles. jennifer jones and william holden are passable, but really anybody could have played these parts. jones' role is horribly written--her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something, the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be.people will undoubtedly tell me i'm taking this film too seriously, that i'm unromantic, etc. but i loved "all that heaven allows," released the same year and just as cornball in its own way, except that douglas sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, whereas henry king (director of "love") is not.i'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case i was just bored.grade: d+

this love story between an american journalist and an eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict, since she is largely westernized (having studied in london), nor any fireworks, since she behaves rather restrained. what little interest the story manages to raise is knocked down further by their wooden dialogs. they are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a hollywood hack who is not much of one himself. the movie also suffers from an amazing lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in crowded little hongkong, overrun by a million chinese refugees? and a presumably accomplished american journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is? hollywood ideas. finally "the song". after hearing it an estimated twenty times throughout the movie, starting right with the credits, it tends to loose some of its emotional impact, sorry to say.

it's valentines day and we decided to stay in, have a nice dinner, and watch this movie on tcm instead of going out. we're in our 40's - 50's, love romance, and are both "softies" but this movie just bombed for us (it's hard to imagine that it was nominated for oscars, etc. but i guess that was then). the cinematography was beautiful but for the most part the movie as a whole is terribly dated. jennifer jones' character made so many references to her being eurasion that we started counting and after a while we were giggling every time she said it. add to that the "theme song" played incessantly throughout the film and we couldn't wait for it to be over so we could watch the evening news.

three delinquents disturb the tomb of an ancient warlock who after summoning jack-o (a less then menacing pumpkin-headed figure) to dispatch said hoodlums, continues on his sworn vengeance to kill every decedents of the family that offed him. that includes young sean kelly and his horror-loving family. of course it's up to sean to find a way to save the day.such a stupid low-budget b-movie. the acting's atrocious and the plot isn't much better. throw in a extremely lame killer, a possible pedophile who laughs way too much & a couple of stereotypical cardboard cutout 'conservative' couple and you have this film in a nutshell. not really worth your time save to see how superbly well linnea is aging. eye candy: linnea quigley is always good for some t&a and she doesn't disappoint here with a lengthy shower scene; rachel carter also gets topless (although it could be a body double)my grade: d-

this is one of those star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. unfortunately, one night at mccool's is a classic "b."goldie hawn recently commented about "town and country" that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script, they also mangled it daily. maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say, "it's the script, stupid." this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through. they're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical, but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre.is it an unmitigated disaster? not entirely. there are some smiles along the way, mostly due to the efforts of the actors. i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking, "eh. it was okay." so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? the ending. if, as it's been noted, the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending, then it misses spectacularly. i really wish i could speak specifically about it, but i hate people who give too much away (even in warning). suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent-over paul reiser (nothing given away here. it's in the trailer), get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking, "eh. it was okay." the rest of the movie is tacked-on and creatively bankrupt. and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. if you loved "there's something about mary" or "meet the parents" (both great movies), then don't bother to see this movie. go have those teeth taken care of instead.

i'm afraid i only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie as it really seemed to me to be mindless tv-trash and a waste of talent. liv tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the part any real kick. as she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel any real concern over any of the characters. even john goodman delivers his weakly comic lines with an absence of panache, as if the witless humour needs to be recited slowly in case anyone misses the joke. the ending is supposed to be good, but the starter and main course left me with no appetite to find out.

horrendous "comedy" in which a beautiful, crazy woman (liv tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (matt dillon, paul reiser and john goodman). dillon hires a hit man (michael douglas) to kill her. what is happening to comedy? the year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever (saving silverman, sugar and spice, freddy got fingered, tomcats, etc etc). this is one of the worst. there's not one, repeat, not one funny moment in it. the jokes are either stupid, unfunny, smutty or real sick. also there's a strong hatred of women in this garbage--the only main female character (tyler) is constantly used as a sex object. also extreme, bloody violence is thrown in at the end. the only bearable moments come from reba mcentire as a psychiatrist and andrew dice clay in two roles--both psychos. dillon, goodman and reiser have hit an all-time career low with this--the only way to go is up. and poor tyler! she quit doing intelligent, gutsy independent films for this? and douglas???? what was he on when he agreed to this? an utter piece of crap--to be avoided at all costs!!!!!!!!!!

corey haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to take out a giant troll and osa hit-man (michael ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (which plays plausible considering haim) oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend as well in this watchable yet disappointing adaption of a decent story. corey haim is terrible, of course but the movie's sheer momentum as well as ironside's imposing presence make this at least a modestly effective film. still the plot is ridiculous and it would've been nicer if we could've seen a monster or at least more gore. at least it's something different. also it's fairly likely that this film will be the last teen movie for awhile to show a teenager making pipe bombs.matt bronson 2/5

corey haim is never going to be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in movies like "licensed to drive", he was more in his element... lowbrow humor.dean koontz's book "watchers" was one of his earlier works, and still probably his finest to date. sadly, this magnificent tale of a brilliant dog, a deranged mutant and a genetic experiment gone wrong is butchered horribly. the acting is so lifeless, you might think you're watching a zombie movie. only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, you'd be better of watching "the incredible journey", "cujo" or even "c.h.o.m.p.s."...okay, maybe not "c.h.o.m.p.s."if you've read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. if you haven't read the book, read it and avoid this movie. you'll thank me later.a somewhat better translation of a dean koontz book is the capable thriller, "phantoms".

dean koontz's book "watchers" is one of the finest books i have read. sadly, the movie is a sad caricature of the book. the disillusioned middle-aged hero and the lonely spinster with whom he finds a meaning to his life are converted in the movie into a couple of silly teenagers, the stoic security agent and the conscientious sheriff are combined into a farcical villain - you get the picture? the moviemakers have taken a moving tale of love, horror and adventure and converted it into a z-grade horror flick aimed - very poorly - at the teen market.buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be far, far more rewarding than watching the movie.

i still find it hard to believe that a fine - if overlong - novel by dean koontz was transformed into this utter excrement.this movie is so bad it's disgusting. boos to all who participated. shame on you!p.s. the fact that sequels have appeared just goes to show how little taste and discretion remains in silver screen land.

this was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god that is koontz? i refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the genius' koontz name. ever since my sight became poor enough to require large print, i have been unable to read this book as i had at least twice a year since first reading it. i missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in large print.i was hoping by renting this movie i would at least get my vicarious watcher's pleasures, but this movie was a travesty. because of subtle plot points, it is my belief none of mr. koontz's, or most decent authors for that matter books can be crammed into 1-2 hours of film.it will be the wise network, cable or other wise, who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple part television movie, i.e. mini series, of this book the right way!one a star out of five - would that i could go lower ...

it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie.imagine king kong being recast as an organ grinder's monkey and fay wray's part being played by a young boy. how about elton john as rambo!!!!.this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter.by using the title watchers and dean koontz's name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book.read the book, i have never talked to anyone who didn't like it. another good book is the winner by david baldachi.

every time i think about this film i feel physically ill. to read such a great book and later discover there's a film of it was a great feeling. years later and imagine my joy at switching on the sci-fi channel and finding it starts in just 5mins!!! up go the titles and then uggg. if just a couple of things had changed ok. everything is changed. numerous characters are removed entirely new rubbish ones are added. the main hero is shrunk and de-aged by about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend/wife is now his mother! even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie capabilities. this is truly appalling cinema at its absolute worst. i would quite happily remove my own toenails with pliers rather than sit through another horrific viewing, and i urge anyone thinking of watching this - please don't. if you own a copy burn it now, right now and think how much better your life would have been had this celluloid insult never occurred.

have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy, where a copy is poorer than the original? caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. they try to duplicate everything from the first movie. now, in a few cases this work. robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight, when they play essentially the same character. i actually like randy quaid, who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original. but jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield, and worse of all, c2 demonstrated once and for all that dan ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. there is very little that i like him in, and c2 nailed the coffin shut on his "comedic" career as far as i'm concerned. he seems to feel the same, sticking more to tuffy like driving miss daisy and hosting psi-factor. other than that, it's mostly, "been there, done that" for caddyshack 2. watch the original twice rather than each version once, and you'll get more for your rental money.

this is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made. the script is unfunny and the acting stinks. the exact opposite of the original.

this movie sucks. it's horrible. if anyone liked it, those people should get there heads examined. jackie mason's character sounds like a retard. that guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. even though chevy chase was in this movie, he wasn't funny. this movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have rodney dangerfield, ted knight, and bill murray. even though jackie mason's character had the personality of rodney dangerfield's character, mason's character sucks. rodney dangerfield was funny! he should have returned! i don't care about ted knight, but bill murray should have returned, also. the original caddyshack was murray's career performance. if he was funny in the first, he could have been funny in the second.final comment: i recommend this movie to... no one!!!!!!!! this movie sucked!!!! it has sucked, it sucks now, and it will always suck!!!!!!!2/10

when a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club, he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from ty webb(chevy chase) and turns it into a theme park/golf course in which everyone can join.this is by no means a good movie, but it is still slightly amusing at times. almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for chevy chase. chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as ty webb for a second time and plays it great. he is not only the funniest character in the movie, he is the only funny character in the movie. even dan akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on comedy central. the movie might have been better if ty webb(chase) had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became jackie mason(who??) they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way! this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie. overall, caddyshack ii is humorous but a large mistake.i do not recommend this movie.

i have vague memories of this movie being funny.having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogether.it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie mason's character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion. its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones. no-one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human.i don't even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for robart stack and the club guys, really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase.

caddyshack ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask 'why?' as in; 'why was it funded?': 'why was it made?' and 'why was it released into the public domain?'.to say the least it's a bad film. it serves little purpose but to underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a 'new money' land developer attempts to buy out the establishment's golf course sanctuary. right off the bat making the follow-up a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre. i mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so. but leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up, or poor imitation as this is, so your sort of obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual contributions by the actors who made the first one so memorable. but there's little if any of this.instead we get cheap imitations. okay the passing of ted knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge smails but robert stack's inclusion as 'chandler young' (a fellow wasp elitist akin to the smails character) is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that made knight's turn so watchable. jackie mason's 'jack hartounian' is a feeble attempt at recreating the non stop wisecracks delivered by the al czervik (rodney dangerfield) character of the first. while dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable mason's is completely forgettable. bill murray's laughably ridiculous groundskeeper 'carl spackler' and his war of attrition with the pesky local gofer is substituted for his ghostbuster's co-star dan ackroyd's role as the militant 'capt. tom everett' who's high pitched voice just splits your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughter.randy quaid , brilliant as cousin ed in the national lampoon's vacation series, is quite the opposite here playing hartounian's unstable lawyer. the looks of disbelief shown by the actor's looking on at quaid's character's intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience. your not laughing. your just asking 'what the hell is he doing?'chevy chase shows up, all be it occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster that's perpetrating itself around him,as club pro 'tye webb' in the films only direct reference to the original not withstanding the golf course itself that is. with his deeply tanned skin and loud hawaiian shirts chase looks like he's just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck. he distances himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some, all be it little, credibility still intact. jessica lundy as mason's daughter 'kate' takes over from the 'danny noonan' role of the original as teenager struggling against class divides. sounds ridiculous doesn't it? at least in the first danny (an irish catholic from a blue collar family) and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the white-anglo-saxon-protestant dominated world of the golf club mover and shakers was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being dismissed by the resident lutheran bishop as well as being mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club. lundy's embarrassment of her father's inability to fit-in is hinted at being because of his jewish roots. that aside it may also have to do with him being a classless moron but such intricacy's are swept aside though i stopped caring long before they were resolved. at the end of the day noonan was trying to get ahead in life. miss hartounian's biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to like her multi-millionaire father so that she can get a date with the club's prodigal white kid. or so i gathered. anyway in summation its poorly written, badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent. indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to it's conclusion. it really is a penance. there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals. maybe they just weren't asked. or perhaps i suspect they actually read the script. stick to the original!!!

after watching caddyshack 1 i'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up. the movie seemed pretty bad and i told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing! all the reviews and everything bad you've heard about caddyshack ii are true. the movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes i've ever heard, the gopher, the acting the whole movie really is bad (randy quaid was funny though).just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all i can really say. i deeply regret watching and buying the dvd but not sure which was the worser decision. just stay away as much as possible.

watch this movie .....only to truly appreciate how good the original is. i'm not real hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it hurt me deeply, because i like chevy chase, jackie mason, and dyan cannon. the writing was just terrible! i thought chevy would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did. there was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie. i went into it wanting to enjoy it. i wanted to laugh but nearly cried. in the beginning credits it read special appearance by chevy chase. this worried me from the start. chevy is actually in more than i thought he would be. it's more than a "special appearance". too bad the appearance wasn't special. mason's character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main. i would rather have seen more (much more)of dyan cannon. at least her character was fun, if not well written. i also missed the gratuatis teen sex scene. mr. gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up. jonathan silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him.i take it back. try..to watch half of this movie, then...remember the alamo, the maine, and caddyshack i.

it sucked.i returned the video after watching half of it. not funny,just a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on a very very funny original. junk, forget it, don't waste your time etc etc

caddyshack ii does no justice for the caddysack. thin plot, thin actors(exception of randy quaid). the only thing that is decent with this movie is the soundtrack..maybe. this movie should have been destroyed when the script was written.

why is this one no good when the first one rocked? try the fact that they attempted to replace rodney dangerfield with jackie mason! please! that's like replacing the beatles with wierd al. randy quaid is the only one that saves this movie from a zero.however, don't let this stop you from watching the first movie which was outstanding.

why was this movie ever made?they have tarnished the original caddyshack with this crap.i was only able to watch half of it and i didn't laugh once.at least i didn't pay to see it because it was on t.v. but i won't get back that hour of my life that i spent watching this dreadful mess.there wasn't one original star from the first except for chevy chase and he probably regrets doing this film.jackie mason was supposed to be the outrageous,funny buffoon like rodney dangerfield was in the first but jackie mason wasn't funny at all.jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield.if you want laugh,watch the first caddyshack.if you like terrible movie's,then this you're movie.this movie stinks like a barnyard in july.avoid at all cost.

this movie is so god-awful that it was literally a chore to watch. i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right. "you lose, we win, yay!" this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny. after that, beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks. and if you're even considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) i have one thing to ask of you: didn't you even look at the cover? i mean, with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is! "oy vey!" this movie sucked.

caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (henry wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (i don't go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. and then i'm comin' upstairs junior, and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a**! do we have an understanding?). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.

when i first viewed this movie, i didn't know the title of it. i realized it had chevy chase in it with the same name he had in caddyshack so i had an idea this was caddyshack 2. at the end of the movie when i did find out it was caddyshack 2 i was disappointed. they could have done better. dan akroyd i thought was bad. the whole story was bad. call this movie by another title, but don't call it caddyshack 2. you give that great movie a bad name. jackie mason's daughter when i first saw her looked like his wife. how old is this girl? geez. how about making this movie a little believable. i thought chevy chase was good.

caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack. but, there are legitimate reasons for it. (1) rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn't like the script, wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he didn't do the film. (2) it was low budget, bill murray had grown to superstar status. ted knight passed away in 1986, and chevy chase the "so called ace" of the first movie (although it was rodney all the way)couldn't't be on more than 5 minutes, because it would cost too much to pay him. but you had dan aykroyd, robert stack, randy quaid and jackie mason, all serviceable substitutes, who none had their best performances.

i saw "caddyshack ii" when i was ten and i mostly laughed because of the horse scene. i should have realized that the movie was as empty as...i can't come up with a good comparison. it's stupid and not even really funny. the cast members from the original who chose not to star in this made probably the best choices that they ever made in rejecting this; why, oh why, did chevy chase return?! and how on earth did jackie mason, robert stack, dyan cannon and dan aykroyd get involved in this swill?! i bet that every person who had his/her name even remotely attached to this junk (e.g., the caterer) is ashamed beyond redemption. so, all in all, it's beyond dreadful, terrible, and everything such. avoid it like you would the ebola virus.

every time i watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes. yes, you read that correctly: i've watched this wretched, foul thing more than once.caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: harold ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties, rodney dangerfield (wisely) walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to tinker with the script, bill murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it, and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better.i can't help but think of dyan cannon in this and wonder why she's perpetually laughing and smiling. the only conclusion i can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil. stay with me a moment. she must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them. she may also have been extremely drunk. that's what i need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind. if i'm lucky it'll be washed out forever.i have seen this film several times. i blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim-witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid. no, the muppet show is funnier now ... guess i was just dull. caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that. it was. it is. it will only get worse with time.my reasons for going back to this film, mercifully, are becoming fewer. randy quaid is limited in his role as jackie mason's lawyer. his opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle. we see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland. randy quaid acquits himself well, and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic, he was it.maybe that's the trick of the movie. it has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it, are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them. years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats.jackie mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness, i'm not sure he deserves it. he's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a rodney dangerfield impersonation. that's who the movie was written for but i'm not sure even he could have saved it. ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction, bad editing (shall we count continuity errors?) and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing.dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by randy quaid's bulldog determination. it isn't even bad enough to laugh at. i've definitely seen worse, but trust your memory -- this one is a dog. if you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and i salute your excellent judgement.

maybe, like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television, i wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what 'slow burn' is. except, aside from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good.eric roberts plays former reporter jacob ash, hired by a gerald mcmurty (raymond j. barry), a rich artist, to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, brian, who had been living with his mother, laine (beverly d'angelo) for the past few years. in a phillip marlowe-esquire fashion jacob ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of brian. but, once jacob tracks down laine, his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. perhaps because events in the film move too slowly, there is never much suspense to this little thriller, not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives.however, as said before, this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then-relatively unknown cast of actors, which include both a very young eric roberts as well as the adorable johnny depp, who plays laine's stepson, donnie. that may be reason enough to give it a try...if you can find it.

this show drives me crazy. it goes against everything a family should be, even if it is intended to be a comedy. the show is suppose to follow dave and vicky gold (michael rapaport and anita barone) as they raise their three teenage children: hilary, larry, and mike. a good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show.i don't think i've ever heard cruder talk from parents to children and vice versa. the only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex. i know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it. the one episode i was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter, hilary a car, not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how hilary is like "their slave."the show fails on the comedy level the most. i haven't laughed at this show once in the numerous times i have attempted to watch it, and i'm a person who gave such films as animal house and dumb and dumber very high marks. michael rapaport is a very good actor and why he choose to ruin his career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me. parents, make sure your children never and i mean never watch this. teenagers, you'll probably get a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references but nothing comes out of it and afterwards you feel rather empty. 1 1/2/ 5 stars.

i grew up watching sitcoms such as seinfeld, roseanne, simpsons, etc. etc. in other words mainstream television. over the years many sitcoms have come on the air and of those a very small percentage are genuinally smart and funny. the war at home is a prime example of the majority of modern american comedy.i give the show a 3 out of 10 because it is what it aims to be, a comedy, but it doesn't seem to go out of its way to be a good comedy. a good comedy should have you swept off your feet with its big jokes, you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in twah i see just about every joke coming. the characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes i have seen yet on screen, and the acting isn't very good save for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer drinking sport loving american idiot perfectly.poor acting, unbelievable characters, and jokes that don't catch you off guard detract from this show to a point of where it is unwatchable. if you don't have cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching, try boston legal. it is more worth your time.

what was he thinking?!?!?! how sad an actor as tremendously talented as michael rapaport- who stole our hearts in "mighty aphrodite" and fascinated us in "ill town"- has sunk to this pathetic level. the writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. shame on all involved. there is a trend: major movie actors that are no longer hot merchandise are turning to tv- often with disastrous results (reference the stinkaroos on cbs and nbc; however, abc has a hit with "boston legal"- hip writing and great nostalgic use of bill shatner). to waste michael rapaport in this "all in the family" rip-off is an insult to viewers and mostly michael himself.

a stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh track that must be from i love lucy. i got rid of tv because of shows like this, but picked up the 1st season at big lots for $3.00. should bought the van damme movie instead.if i was a conspiracy theorist, who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and keep coming up with this drivel/propaganda in order to undermine family values i would point to this show, married with children, family guy etc. but i'm not so i won't.btw i'm not christian, love the simpsons and peep show. i watched two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular, who are they popular with? then i remembered all those fotos of the people of walmart that have been circulating around the web and thought ah ha!. it is no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is prime time.

i'm one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days-i still will check them out every once in a while.my observation is that most of them aren't very funny even the ones on major networks that are getting high ratings ,i just don't get who is finding them gut busting funny. while a few have made me crack a smile ,none of them made me laugh out loud,i usually change the channel after a few minutes. now on the fox network they churn out new shows like changing your underwear,for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom,wrong dead wrong. they have beat this dead horse so much it is to the point of hiring just anyone they can find to write a crappy pilot with bad dialog and just churn them out.let's take a brief look at the latest piece of junk that fox has churned out called "the war at home"i watched about 5 minutes of it and that was generous. in this particular episode,the daughter is mouthing off to her parents doing the i'm an adult now rant.the dad gets fed up tells her "ok fine,go ahead and do whatever you want,if you screw up it's your problem" to which she replies"well i guess your mad but hey at least i didn't get aids"(cue the laugh track,no way that can be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud such garbage)-i found the crack about not having aids to be in such bad taste. well hey at least i don't have to watch any more of this crap. take a hint fox, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.ok well you have the simpsons but it is now getting really old and tired as well.

what fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of mean, obnoxious, spoiled kids, and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to being a parent?? i'm sorry, i don't get it. the one episode that i was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a bar mitzvah, with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money. of course, the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and bes-test party of all, and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event. the ditzy, brain dead, boy crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between wanting to be jewish and then catholic, when she see's the "cute" religious tutors.the one borderline "heartwarming" moment in the entire episode, was when the putz of a father, who has been convinced the entire time that the bar mitzvah is solely a money making scheme, see's the son studying his hebrew lessons, and is momentarily duped into thinking that perhaps, his conniving offspring is being sincere about the right of passage into manhood. this warm, fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a bris, a certain "procedure" needs to be performed. the bar mitzvah is called off, and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to comply.this show is garbage, and i am saddened that i shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life i wasted watching this piece of crap, because nothing else was on tv ...

i watched the first episode of "the war at home" because i thought it was worth replacing "arrested development", boy, was i disappointed. it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped-off of "grounded for life", "titus", and "married...with children" since they are all similar in plot and overall mood. the so called "punch lines" are all repetitious and formulaic, even more, those "punch lines" aren't even funny at all, to me, they're more along the lines as being crass and crude. the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug, who thinks he's being funny and cool, which he's not. (even hillary (dave's daughter) said so in the episode "gaza strip").in the episode "dream crusher", hillary wanted to be a singer {but was actually pretty bad}, dave and vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked. after that, she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to harvard, after telling dave and vicky so and left the room, the two of them began mindlessly mocking her. also, in the first episode dave said of hillary's {black} boyfriend "does she actually think we're gonna let her go out with this guy? i'd rather drink my own urine", that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television. and dave is constantly making fun of larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek. also, let's not forget that he also made fun of larry's (fat) girlfriend. dave is the father he's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what. "the war at home" is without a doubt the worst tv show for family. that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda. it's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something, but the lines are all somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetically juvenile.another reason why the show's horrible is the acting, mike rappaport and kyle sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. rappaport has to always move his hands around when he's in front of the camera, he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with "boston public". sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in "malcolm in the middle"}.so to wrap this whole thing up, you all got your reasons of what's wrong with this show 1.it's unoriginal 2.the acting sucks 3.it's not even funny 4.all the jokes are the same 5.has lousy script 6.the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7.the dad's a rip-off of archie bunkerfox needs to take this trash off the air, because anything's better than this.

there are shows and films i've seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdb.com that i've disagreed with, and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion.reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to browse the internet, posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible for.how else would one explain a review opining that this show is "sure to become a phenomenon" a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort?i won't waste words describing this mess, but suffice to say if you enjoy, wives who emasculate their husbands, husbands who emasculate their sons, children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to legitimise characters that are basically just unfunny one-liner spewing automatons, then watch this show.i, on the other hand, have some seinfeld dvds to get through.futurama - cancelled. titus - cancelled. arrested development - cancelled. the war at home - renewed.no justice.

i have been living in istanbul for 24 years and i (a 39 years of experience would suggest) do know what istanbul has gone through all those years.faith akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falling in the great mistake of being orientalist when looking at turkey (just as his other movie gegen die wand did) this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and misleads the audience when giving out (quite false) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of istanbul.anyone who could speak turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie (siyasiyabend for one ) are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as 'representatives' of the contemporary turkish music. much less a piece of crap which many turkish listeners even do not know about at all.we turks have long been accustomed to 'superficious' westerners who look at turkey with some orientalist point of view: trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind molds.. what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish originated director (faith akin) is making the same mistake: looking at turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better. all of a vain effort.just ask any turkish friend of yours: what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : zeki muren, baris manco, ajda pekkan, teoman, muslum gurses, ibrahim tatlises, ferdi ozbegen?.. and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today?faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people's minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music.

what can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks? the hero starts out in ninjaville, japan, goes through an identity crisis (saving a shinobi), makes a voyage to america (saving a slave named sam) engages in a little wild west action (saving a french/japanese native american named julie), goes hunting pirate's gold, and then heads back to japan to fight a war. the film obviously has no clue where it's going at any point in time; i think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he'd watched. if you're going to watch this film, i suggest renting the subtitled so you and your peers can openly discuss how dumb the movie is without speaking over the movie, potentially missing another dumb plot twist.movies the director was watching during the making of this movie - an american tail, fievel goes west, star wars, indiana jones, the goonies, teenage mutant ninja turtles, kung fu, vampire hunter d, the ten commandments.notes of interests - most fear inspiring line of all time. about 90 minutes (or 19 days) into the movie, the lead character has just bested an american villain, and just as one heads to the vcr to end the pain the hero proclaims "let's go back to japan", and the agony continues for another week.

above all, you must not take this movie seriously. it takes itself seriously, unfortunately, but that can't be helped. this anime ninja flic has to be the crowning achievement in spoiling what could have been an endearing, if unoriginal, story with bad plot twists, ridiculous time-killing cutscenes, and one outrageous guest appearance which will either make you laugh or groan (or both, like me).while i'm typically a fan of ninja/samurai anime (ninja scroll and rurouni kenshin to name a few), this one has to be the exception. for the record, from a technical point of view of its time, this movie was very well animated and constructed. it is just the plot that stunk. the authors of this movie clearly decided (for what rational reason i don't know) that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway around the world in search of a treasure that (he learns) his father fought and died for. in the process, he saves a black slave named sam, meets a french girl who is living in an apache village, makes friends with a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members then he knew he had in the weirdest places and circumstances (and whom all subsequently die at some point in the movie).even so far, these ludicrous plot twists could be excused, but then come the two "guest appearances". #1: after having a ridicuously cliche showdown with two cowboys, jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "mark twain". at this point, you're probably saying "what the ****?!!" this "meeting" serves one purpose: it entirely discredits a movie which tries to add to itself an educated historical background. i found it disappointing that the authors went to all this trouble to research the 1860s us and didn't manage to realize that "mark twain's" real name was samuel clemens. #2: when jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it used to belong to captain kidd. i can hear the groans of disgust now.finally, there are the running scenes. these scenes show various characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them, for several minutes, and there are a lot of them. it is these scenes which make this movie, 2hrs 12 min, to seem to last a week and a half.if you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitled movie that just asks to be made fun of, this is it. feel free to poke fun at every possible aspect of it, and have fun. just don't take it seriously. 3/10

i have no idea who these others are but this movie is plain awful. they have to prop up joe pesci when he is a minor character. bait and switch movie just like the studios did with adam sandler and jim carrey, etc. the dvd i watched states "this obscure gem revolves around joe pesci's mob character who is a hothead that start a war" etc. etc. joe plays the part of joe, he does not even carry a gun, plays a whimpy character and gets spoiler - (whacked). so much for the movie revolving around pesci. the only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score. if you watch this movie after reading this, i warned you. please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.

bad news for anyone wanting to film a full-length parody of a lifetime network movie- the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it, albeit unintentionally. all of the lifetime tropes are there- a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints, forcing her to stand up for herself. especially jaw-dropping is the scene where the heroine, after enduring a break-in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve the stress by going shopping! having seen first hand the harassment of a co-worker by some creep she met at church, i know stalking is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.

warning: this may contain spoilers!!first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that....lifetime movies. some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category. it actually started out with some potential....single, divorced hard working mom (who gets out of work at 2:00 am) cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let's just say he doesn't take it too well. the stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed. so she goes to her mother's for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows up. this seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping!!! so the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does mom do? she goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza!!! i couldn't believe it! then it really gets stupid! and the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.

even if i had not read anne rice's "queen of the damned" from the "vampire chronicles," i probably would still have thought this movie was just awful.it was tasteless, plot-less, it made absolutely no sense at all. i sat for a while pondering the plot disassociated from the book, and the longer i thought of it, the worse it was. to associate it in any way with the prior chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie, let alone the book. the bare few ideas taken from rice's genius in "the vampire chronicles" were butchered and ridiculed.it is an absolute insult to anne rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being aaliyah's last film. truly, it's an insult to aaliyah fans as well.possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics. good as they may be, it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie. as a matter of fact, i signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating to people bothering to look at this film (7 years after the release, as it may be) to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment.

this is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all times. i started to watch this right after interview with the vampire and i was thoroughly disappointed. not only did this movie's script have craters as big as the grand canyon, the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving the viewers thoroughly puzzled. the vampire lestat played by stuart townsend was terrible-having a good body does not make you an actor! the end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the viewers intelligence. i'll give this one star because aaliyah actually tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. other than that i would advice anne rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story.

''queen of the damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that i already saw. the only thing that i like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything else besides that.( since i am a fan of korn, marilyn manson, chester bennington of linkin park and wayne static of static-x)there are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that i don't even know how to start. so many stories were cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favorite)armand and daniel's relationship and even louis is not present, to mention a few.(the plot was dead) first, they should have made a movie of ''the vampire lestat'', because it is the second book after ''the interview with the vampire'',and not ''queen of damned''. they tried to squeeze in a single movie so many informations, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles.so many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie. it is pandora's case, for example.the actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of anne rice's descriptions, specially marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful,tall,imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like lestat. (stuart towsend is also far from being like lestat) i didn't understand why they changed lestat's maker to be marius instead of magnus as well.''interview with the vampire'' was an awesome movie, i loved the actors and tom cruise as lestat was perfect and far superior then stuart townsend.(i am sad that tom cruise declined the chance of playing lestat again) only antonio bandeiras as armand didn't match with armand's looks, but anyway, far superior from this crap movie called '' the queen of damned''.anne rice was so picky about interview that i didn't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production.

i remember all the hype around this movie when aaliyah was killed. being a fan of ms. rice's novels, my first thought was "how can they do queen of the damned without doing vampire lestat first?"having finally seen the movie, now i can see how they did it. if you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from vampire lestat, cramming marcus and marius into one character, and removing everything to do with lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the theatre of the vampires, and also louis, claudia, and gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in queen of the damned.what we loose is a very important piece of lestat's character. his inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with louis, armand, gabrielle, and all the other vampires.also important to the story is that we loose the "story of the twins", which is the genesis of ms. rice's vampires. and while i am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient egypt.even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between jessie and lestat. the vampire chronicles is basically an american yoni story. for those that do not know, yoni is another form of hentai (japanese porn comics). but in yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female. while i am sure many men object to the "gayness" of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way. for instead of lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.and the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast. at the beginning lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet. marius has no idea who elvis is, and says he slept through that period. makes you wonder how lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself. and nothing is ever even mentioned about louis, claudia, or gabrielle. i think that is a huge shame. is like seeing "snow white and the 3 dwarfs".overall, the movie i thought was really bad. about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack. most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like enkil after he was sucked dry.if you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get lost boys, the original interview with a vampire, or even some old episodes of dark shadows. let this one rest in piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of holy water in the mouth.in ending, remember that before aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned. it is obvious now why this was. it is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.i rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.

i'm usually not inclined to write reviews about films i don't think deserve a mention. but, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, i feel it is important to express my thoughts when i don't like a film. "queen of the damned" is one of those films.anne rice's popular horror stories of lestat, a bisexual vampire, first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful "an interview with a vampire". starring two of hollywood's biggest heavyweights in tom cruise and brad pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience. while it may have been a case of style way over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (i have never been that enamoured with the vampire genre in general).since that time brad pitt and tom cruise have gone on to much bigger things. it's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel. they would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome. "queen of the damned" typifies the type of cr*p hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.needless to say this film is terrible from the start. lestat, now played by brit stuart townsend of "shooting fish" fame, awakens from his dark grave to the sound of... you guessed it, nu-metal. he freaks out some confused punkish musicians and joins their band, under the proviso that he only appear at night, what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day...jesse (marguerite moreau), a student studying the paranormal (vampire studies 101 perhaps?), tries to find out if lestat really is who he says he is. along the way she falls for him (something to do with her odd past), but has a little competition in queen akasha (aaliyah), a vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire lestat as her chosen king.the film is shamefully self-indulgant, yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour. anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general! watching townsend is enjoyable. he knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting. the late aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role. she has minimal screentime, and what she does have she does not use to the fullest. the poor makeup and special effects do not help; at times she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox.it is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until aaliyah's untimely death last year. with the possibility for people to see her final film, warner bros put this out to a general release. otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible.no doubt films like this will continue to be made. look at the spate of teen rom-com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like "not another teen movie". if there is a market to exploit hollywood will do so.the biggest issue i have with this film is not the film itself. hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it. that's business. but what concerns me the most is that people will actively go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it! i guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema: is film art first and entertainment second, or is it the other way around? the only people who can decide that is the audience. if you like and are intrigued by good films, stay clear of this turkey.

why did they unleash this movie upon us? it seems as though they set out to make this movie a total slap in theface to anne rice and every self respecting vampire chronicles fan. it ignores the ground work laid down by interview with the vampire,mutilates the plot of the novel and has stuart townsend stumbling around drunk.stuart is not our lestat! our brat prince, our adventurous rebel with the damndest sense of humor. stuart is a second rate, boring rip off of dracula in black leather. he did not read the books or know the character...is he illiterate? tom cruise is dyslexic and still he made a point to read the books and know and love lestat.don't kid yourselves, it is not a "stand alone" vampire flick it's trash plain and simple.

i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. i couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. the novels are amazing, and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. i hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with the vampire lestat. they change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. they destroy lestat's history. the acting of the queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but i just can't bring myself to laugh. the charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. the movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and "dark" imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny goths of america would lap it up. part of the appeal of the first movie, of louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. thank goodness i read the books first, or i'd have never touched them after this movie.

this film was basically set up for failure by the studio. one, anne rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.i maintain the only way for these two books -vampire lestat and queen of the damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the 1700's to the 1980's and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, lestat. the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned. without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with akasha's plans, marius did not make lestat, lestat did not love jesse or make her, lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, marius was not after david nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, basically same names different story.if they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. but don't piggie back into the theaters off the success of rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.if you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. that being said, i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. catch 22, must see it, will hate it.

i thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it. the premise was too silly and predictable. i didn't make it far into the movie.let me see. she is obviously older than the cabbie (unless she is a lot younger than she looks). he is black and she is white. she makes more money than him (he is only a cabbie). that's 3 of society's most statistically failed unions all rolled up in one and we are supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell. she would be better off marrying the guy she doesn't love.i only watched it partially because i love mjw as an actor. his acting was superb. hers, meh! it was ok but the premise is too silly. didn't see the end. couldn't make it there so i don't know if it ended differently from the way i predicted the ending would be. i can't imagine any black woman liking this movie. there is something sickening about watching a black man catering to a white woman like that. and an old one at that. please! not in the real world!

my daughter liked it but i was aghast, that a character in this movie smokes. as if it isn't awful enough to see "product placement" actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies - at least children movies should be more considerate! i wonder: was that intentional? did big tobacco "sponsor" the film? what does it take to ban smoking from films? at least films intended for children and adolescents. my daughter liked it but i was aghast, that a character in this movie smokes. as if it isn't awful enough to see "product placement" actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies - at least children movies should be more considerate! i wonder: was that intentional? did big tobacco "sponsor" the film? what does it take to ban smoking from films? at least films intended for children and adolescents.

i want to say i liked this film, i really do, but when it boils down to it it was just far too boring. it starts off looking promising, and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great. the problem is the monster, or lack of it. as people have said it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look great if done properly). the problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths. this is meant to be a horror film so a lack of monster and a lack of deaths equals boredom. there were some scenes i liked, such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her. there are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for. it's a shame, because i can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick. the saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again, because film makers over-polish their films these days and rely on crappy cgi effects.

some movies are just  unlucky. these are the films that obviously thrived on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but simply didn't have the budgetary means and/or professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen. "the strangeness" definitely belongs in this category. you really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and undemanding 80's horror fanatics will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of cheapness, clumsy stop-motion effects and impenetrably dark cinematography. "the strangeness" has a fairly original plot and setting (okay, it's similar to "the boogens" but i sincerely doubt that director david michael hillman intentionally ripped off a fellow insignificant 80's b-movie) and the players deliver enthusiast performances even though they're all miscast. an assembly of amateur speleologists go on an expedition to explore the infamous gold spike mine. many years ago, several miners mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned ever since, but there's supposed to be too much gold hidden there to remain closed forever. shortly after they descended into the mine, the group members one by one encounter the slimy ruler of the gold spike mine; a lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward. throughout most of its running time, "the strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting. the characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the helmets of the speleologists. there's very little action or horror to experience in the first hour, but director hillman cleverly grasps the viewers' attention by showing bits and pieces of the monster at regular intervals. as soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle, you're doomed to keep watching till the very end. the creature is realized with stop-motion effects, which i usually adore and worship, but here in this case they look extremely weak and pitiable. the person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of ray harryhousen. the death sequences largely occur off-screen and there's very little suspense throughout the whole movie. a horror flick with a setting like this should benefice from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "the strangeness" lacks all this. the biggest trump of the film is unquestionably the beautiful appearance of blond actress terri berland. she resembles a speleologist as much as i resemble mother theresa, but she surely looks good in her tight white top and beige pants.

a group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. this low budget ($25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and i'm not exactly sure why (unless it is because it is so obscure). i'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. even in the extras co-writer chris huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. i would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from usc so i would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. anyway, like i said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool john carpenter-like score. i wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds.even if the movie isn't the best, code red dvd has given this great attention. you have interviews and an audio commentary by director melanie anne phillips, producer/actor mark sawicki and co-writer huntley. the tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring (like a cave set being built in a backyard). even more interesting are sawicki and huntley's usc student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. sawicki has worked steadily in hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. the film's vhs is kind of legendary for how dark it was and i'm sure this is much better. however, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. safe to say, the original my bloody valentine is still "horror film set in a mine" champ.

this extremely low-budget monster flick centers around a group of mine surveyors exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth reopening. they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange, slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time. the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was 'desperate'. the script and acting is terrible, the stop-motion monster effects were unintentionally funny, and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly looked like a logistical nightmare. all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie failed not from lack of effort, but maybe from either a lack of budget, experience and/or lack of creative inspiration. the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateurs, i have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when they completely miss the mark. i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for effort and a d- for actual results, not insultingly bad as some low-budget monster movies i've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands. i'm voting it a 4.

my boss at the time and showed it to us at a halloween party at our office. he is the chris huntley that co-wrote and acted in it. he knows it's bad, we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks way too much like a vagina to be coincidence. maybe it was from a gynocological experiment gone wrong.it was a very low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of "hey gang, lets' put on a show".nobody got hurt and it was a first attempt. nothing wrong with that. it gave us all a good laugh and it's a great film to watch with friends and make fun of. :-)

a ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, worst screenplay, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely ununderstandable...if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done, judging by this one, the entire world movie industry would now be dead...a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who "think" they can make movies.i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us...

you would probably get something like this. i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence. of course, there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break, but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art. but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap". to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, i can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much. i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art movie) to portray a slavic woman as a half-articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three-legged stool.

first, i don't see how the movie is on any "best" list or how it won any awards. compared to la pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, la pianiste is gold. this movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much. the lead actor was annoying, i felt as though i never knew what was going on, and i was bored!! even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting, i wanted it to end.... as soon as possible. why did it have to be his sister and cousin? ugh. and why did thibault get mean? he just bipolarly turned mean. and also, was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about? who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in? i mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in french culture? european culture? i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that!

french cinema sucks! down with all these psychiotric visions with their my-god-am-i-cultivated distinguished attitudes! pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres! i'll no longer have a mind for that! léos carax, did you ever think about, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid??? maybe i'm too common to understand you? or had it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a frenchman the world can have? guillaume the to-be-guilliotined comes to his home-palace, mme. deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "here am i, darling!" in this moment, i knew, that she's in the bathtub, and we`ll see her lying in there soon. don't misunderstand me, i'm not prudish, and the incestous sex scene was the climax of the film. but this is, in berlin, we say "etepetete", what means something like "être-peut-être", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, the worst, seen that often in french movies i can tell! other example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in a mirror, combing her hair, and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushs into the room, breathless shouting: "there's no escape, there's no escape!" forty years after existencialistic sartres and consorts- what's new, what's exciting about? my god, there's that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? and when you're not, please explain much better, why!! born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza, no escape, is that the point?

the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub. she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal. the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.

i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off. but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation...."last year at marienbad" comes to mind. well, "pola x" ain't no "last year at marienbad". i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years. "pola x" achieved membership in that august group. in my defense, i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground - hoping things would turn around. however, i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances. "pola x" does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work. after a 10 year hiatus, that must have been bitter for him indeed. melville is still spinning in his grave!

pretentious claptrap, updating herman melville (!), about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long-lost sister who has been raised by gypsies. or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi-layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (the siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings). considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve (who at least gets to bathe in the nude), i was expecting a lot more from this one; apparently, there's an even longer tv version of pola x out there

it's difficult to express how bad this movie is. even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the smug middle-class mores of both the usa and western europe, this movie would have been a stinker. the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if that's the correct latin grammar); the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics (by the male lead as well as the females); the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's (or somebody's) breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie -- i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic. the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot -- but underneath his clothes, this king has no substance.

i enjoyed carax's "les amants du pont neuf" and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard. well, the first 10 minutes were ok, but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life. a sad disappointment.

i won't lie, i rented this film because it was an "arty" film with some possible explicit sex. i got that scene and catherine deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like "did i have a mother or father, i don't know" (paraphrased). usually delivered in long soliloquies.if you are curious about the transition of "art" to porn, might be an interesting look, with use of the fast forward button (i was still too slow!)

(spoilers)oh sure it's based on moby dick. totally obsessed and it destroy's him. it's a total folly. the movie starts off rather well, but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.the supposed half sister is never convincing. some very poor lighting effects. music is interesting. but little else. it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. i suppose if you like being john malkovich, you might like this. but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again, pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell. the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either.)this movie is severely boring, depressing, and poorly directed. not highly recommended. if if you like french movies. (go watch crimson rivers instead)4/10quality: 5/10 entertainment: 1/10 replayable: 0/10

this movie is so unreal. french movies like these are just waste of time. why watch this movie? even, i did not know..why. what? the well known sex scene of half-siblings? although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story it is based upon is so unreal. what is the use of it, then? can you find easily in life, half sibling doing such things?did i learn something from this movie? yeah: some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies, such stories, such non-sense. but for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there you are.. you've got to see this movie.only one worth adoring, though: catherine deneuve. she's such a strikingly beautiful woman.

i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. at least he'd have wound up with something.the film struck me as pointless, rambling, and very stylish, like some other recent french films. not to knock it. most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever. we should be grateful, i suppose, for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind-blown continental winter, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up.but there can be too much of a good thing. golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night, carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such. (there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. you'll love it if you're vlad the impaler.) lots of people die. catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. i don't know why. golubeva's young girl dies too, and i don't know why she dies either. she gets slapped in the face, falls to the pavement, and dies.there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too. i'll have to take their word for it because, although it is stylishly photographed, it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. don't worry about the kiddies being shocked. they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway.depardieu isn't a bad actor. as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man -- well, handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way -- to a limping, murderous, hairy physical wreck, we feel sorry for the guy. golubeva has a wan pretty face, with enormous half-lidded eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. her next movie should be a remake of lewton's "i walked with a zombie." then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. i guess it's a band. as far as i could make out, the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of "easy listening" might not enjoy it. if you don't like the music, there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieu's walking stick.i must say, i found it barely worth sitting through. (and it's a longie, too.) at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by, sometimes stopping entirely. i wish it had had a few jokes.

this movie was awful, plain and simple! the animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. it was very clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill!! the acting was just as bad.. i've seen better acting in pornographic films. i would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back. in fact, i registered on imdb just so that other people don't get sucked into watching this like i did. don't get me wrong though, i love sci-fi films! this one seemed more like the intro to a video game :( i'm glad i only spent a dollar to see this one! the story line reminded me of the movie pitch black, a prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes. oh my goodness.. what are we gonna do??? i would not even let this play in the background of my house while i was cleaning! bottom line here, you can do better.

i've got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! plot is choppy and very predictable. most of the actors seem like extras with no experience! everyone has scottish accents. it's like watching a crew of 'scotties' from star trek without the personality or charm. needless scenes of people putting up tents! tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment! actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them. nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment! nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining. do not waste your time!

i really didn't like this film~!!!! it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all.. i'm more of an action girl, and it had none. i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left.. but was totally mislead! don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom. i just really didn't like the movie. it wasn't my style, but it could be yours.. you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl.. don't get this movie! this scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of godfrey reggio's koyaanisqatsi, allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints. this just isn't for me!

it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. the historical aspect was great. everything else was horrible, the plugs for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute, the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation, they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening. thanks for wasted 2 hours of my time! when there was evidence, it would fly by! most of it was just people talking about the place.the episode of the ghosthunters show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was. i am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this, i haven't watched it since it aired.

how is this a documentary? much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given southern city. quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source. george orwell was the most identified quoter. documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self-promotion. film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in, as if trying to ape blair witch, hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate. is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of tb, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? the line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored... how could this possibly be listed in my tivo as documentary? it's a vacation promo, and at that it fully succeeds.hell, i'd visit the joint if i could locate it on google earth. not scary said a previous poster. not too serious either, says i. fascinating story. flimsy film-making.

basically, this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible director, which happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie i've ever seen, so avoid it at all costs.as for this documentary, it's entertaining; entertaining and blatantly misleading! most of the "historical" looking footage is most likely just that, historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise. there's no doubt that waverly is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it's own fascinating history, but manufacturing a documentary to market the locale and the related production is, for lack of better words, appallingly useless.and yes, i've lived in kentucky my whole life, and i have visited the location numerous times. waverly hills deserves respect; and there's nothing respectful about this lame documentary.

the first film i saw from these people was "children of the grave" and when i heard that this one was coming on i thought it would be good to watch mostly because waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted. this documentary/film was awful! there was too much fake commentary from the producers, directors, camera men...they needed to keep their faces out of this film. waverly has been rumored to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary. the paranormal proof was horrible and almost non-existent. i have heard better evps from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom! they tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. not the stories, not the blurry too dark to see anything videos, not the pictures, not the tape recordings! children of the grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor. the only reason i am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative. learning about how the hospital came about, the daily life there,and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this 2hr piece of crap.

i watched this after seeing "death tunnel" (this being, without question, the worst movie i've ever seen in my life) so you can understand i went in rolling my eyes a little at seeing the directors and producers of that cinematic gem being in charge of this one. first of all, i thought the director and producer were the same guy. they both are kid rock meets dawg the bounty hunter. i watched the taps investigation, and i am not a skeptic- i think taps is the closest one will ever get to a scientific method in the field. that was cool and believable- i do believe they are haunted.but this, like the reviewer above mentioned, like taking a tour. okay a tour, fine, but the "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to make a pretty penny and have a financial investment into whether its haunted or not, so when they have fantabulous stories, i have to take it with a heaping teaspoon of salt.as someone else mentioned, i could make out whatever they wanted me to see in the picture about 50% of the time. the rest of the time, i couldn't make out anything. also without any context to the photos- time of day, type of camera, moisture in the room, dust particles (which 75% are what the orbs are), weather and a ga-gillion other factors, i cant accept them. i also cant help thinking that some might be doctored.why would that band keep the numbers from the door? vandalism? also during the taps investigation, they tried to dig up the death certificates of those nurses- and they only found one which was ruled "accidental" (people didn't want to officially proclaim suicide). yet when one of the guides was mentioning this, he said "yep, and its marked suicide." it really felt like the guides to the haunted houses here in october.i did however like the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospital(s), that really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch. i'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions, and weren't some ghoulish-wardens. they weren't the best methods, but its all they had. they were desperate to stop the disease.

i am very into waverly hills and first watched death tunnel the movie.couldn't have been much worse. then i heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effects.wrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should be.waverly hills doesn't need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is. tours are $20.00 per person and $100.00 for 8 hour overnight investigation per person minimal group of 10 for overnight investigation.tours must be set up ahead of time. awesome place for the ghost hunter!

let me preface by stating that i have lived in louisville, kentucky all of my life. i grew up about ½ mile from waverly. in the wintertime we would pull our sleds down maryman road and cross dixie highway to go sleigh riding on waverly hill. many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves. the place was still being run as a "geriatric center" at the time. we would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the "door to the morgue". i have to be honest. the only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing. i would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. nothing stranger than teen-aged boys acting stupid ever happened. i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years. one evening when i was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire. there was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. it burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched. the thing that gets lost about waverly is that many people survived tb there. let's face itthe doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people. it took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious tb was. too much is focused on those who suffered. i also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70's. we would go and visit shut-ins in the nursing home through a church youth group. by the way, the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film. they were wooden and opensometimes too open. it did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia. it was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. a lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn't paid off. this is after all kentucky. the part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart. if i am not mistaken it appears to have been holocaust footage. that was added for dramatic effect. it left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. i am a skeptic when it comes to "ghosts". i do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted. waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.

i love watching a good gory giallo. unfortunately, solange is definitely not one of them. it's long. very long. the story is tacky and makes very little sense even if it's very obvious. the script spends so much time on the killings and the girls but it spends almost no time at all on the killer. this leaves a big hole in the story: we might get to see a bunch of young women showering together but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls. yes, what happened to solange is terrible but we still pretty much left in the dark over when, why did the [boring] killer decided that it was worth going through the effort of offing those oh so naughty girls. it's all so contrived that i couldn't get into it one bit.as for the look of the film, again, boring. nothing memorable about it. the actors? boring. the script? laughably boring. the whole "torrid" love affair between the teacher, the blond and the student was really embarrassing. what planet are they living on? the music? boring. skip it.

solange is not a great italian thriller. get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, the professor, didn't do it. but is it really a spoiler? no, because you know that he couldn't have been the murderer from the very beginning; he and a student witnessed the first murder. so, there is absolutely no suspense as to whether or not the professor is the killer. there is a long, tedious build up to the final explanation of the mystery. the solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. the rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) is just not exciting enough to hold your interest. even in the tradition of "wrong man accused" it fails, because the police never seriously accuse the professor, and the killer is never after him. dull, dull, dull.

first off just to say i didn't get the edition i thought i would - i chose the italian version over the r2, but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 - claiming to be a special edition - i never knew there was a uk dvd release - but the promised biogs were not actually on the disc - just a couple of duff trailers. anyway - as to the film itself - just as i was recovering from "night train murders" my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month - this time in (an italian) uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi - (unhappily) married but nailing one of his students - becomes the main suspect. joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case. sorry to say i was less than entranced. it was watchable but more than equally miss able,and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime, the "surprise" killing of cristina galbo which was actually "spoilt" by the dvd cover telling me about it - grrrrrr!!!! and a surprise twist that cast the "victims" in a new light - i thought this was very routine. itwont put me off the two "sequels" though. with karin (hannibal brooks)baal and camille (i spit on your grave") keaton.

so i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released (release is 8/21), just watched it today, and now i'm speechless. they could have had a decent movie here, but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways.first of all, the parts with john krasinski were funny, and are the only reason i gave it above a 3, but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections on life between the main character (andrew keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying lacy chabert). it would have been much, much better as a straight comedy ala lock, stock and two smoking barrels.i wanted to like it, because i think krasinski is funny and want to see him do well. the story wasn't bad either, just not very original. but the directing (and a lot of the acting) was terrible. i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway.their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a "dirty harry" gun is not a .357 magnum but a .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 magnum).so see this if you 1- really like john krasinski 2- like to watch low-budget (and poorly-directed) movies or 3- have too much time on your hands (this is me!)

ten years ago i really wanted to see this movie on the cinema. but i missed it, and then forgot about it. oh boy, am i glad this movie didn't get to ruin my teenage eyes back then.i saw it yesterday, and seriously, this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made. and i'm talking about movies which has had too much attention, such as those wonderful trailers on tv, and too much money spent on actors and the making of the movie.the script sucks and the acting sucks even worse, do i need to say more?please, hollywood, no more arnold!!

i did not enjoy the film eraser whatsoever. it's awful acting, boring storyline and average special effects made this an annoying arnie film, as it had a mountain of potential. with other action films of the time eraser fell very short!!!

this movie is bad. just bad. in absolute terms, bad. the dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter, and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety. racism is bad. racism in los angeles can be especially bad. i live in the city of angels, i can attest to that. what is so terrible about the bigotry in los angeles is its insidious nature. it creeps at you with a knowing glance, or a swallowed word. until just at the edge of a full on fist-fight, it almost never comes right out and says, "why did he have to be black!" i can see quite clearly that the car-jackers are black, the detective's partner is hispanic, the da is white. as long as there is film rolling through the projector, i can let the visuals, music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. characters emote, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. that is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. that trust is raped by this movie. a good film pulls you in directions as an audience, and it steers you with cues to drive to a point. this movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. my unanswered question is, why did we as a society say collectively, "thank you?"

okay, it was very good...but best picture? please, not even close. munich was better, capote was much better, good night and good luck was much better...brokeback mountain - well, that should have won! the academy voters seem to act like the current day democrats - please just a little of everyone, but don't dare take any concrete positions. that's why we have a complete moron in office in the us.this has been the worst aa presentation ... and forget 1987 ... since way before that. hollywood is so afraid of it's bottom line, that it can't be set "straight". many voters apparently didn't even see brokeback mountain. get real and get with it.this was the most pathetic year since i have been watching in the mid- 60's and i was only two.wake up, whoever you are. hollywood is mainstream, and that's what happened to the box office in 2005. king kong, the last star wars film, another batman film, a re-make or whatever of charlie and the chocolate factory, and much more to come in 2006.at least there were original best pictures, i.e. munich, but heard that one before, capote - great; katherine keener should have won, even though now we know reese can sing like a cash/carter, etc., syriana was a much better picture than crash. that film has been done, since the early 1960's and we have to make that the best film? what a horrible oscar night and a horrible year to end with in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. at least the bafta for best picture went to brokeback, and what about the horrible song that won? pathetic. i think we only have about 20 years left as america or the usa, before someone comes in and changes up things a bit. maybe it will be china since they own so much of this country ... or india, because they have all the high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the entire world.america has become the land of the fat, the pathetic, and the stupid. trash can be found in more places than florida, west virgina, south dakota, and in the mid-west.drive-through a local mcdonald's or burger king for goodness sake. order all you want until you get a heart attack. put yourself out of your misery.

i had gone to the movies expecting to see a great film based on all the word of mouth and terrific reviews. the minute the opening sequence started i knew i was in trouble. the music and credits were trying so hard to evoke emotion i wanted to puke. all i got from this film was clichéd characters, contrived dialog and an unemotional script. director/writer paul haggis' has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative, self righteous writing, but it doesn't fool me. some performance were good. don cheadle is always good. i think terrance howard is slightly over rated but he was decent. ludicrous was way too on the nose. he should stick to rapping. brendan fraser was fine. jennifer esposito left no impression what so ever. i find nothing interesting about her. sandra bullock is always the same in every movie, she's just okay. matt dillon was very good and i enjoyed watching him work. ryan philippe was good as well. but as far as the script and the lousy directing- this is actually one of those movies that is so annoyingly bad i actually took the time to write about it. i would not recommend this film to anyone, what a waste of time.

through its 2-hour running length, crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10-odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in american society. that and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days.the era we live in has become so complicated. not only do we reject modernism, even the not very enthusiastic flag-waving of post-modernism ideas is always being shot down by what, post-post-modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas, all in no part thanks to the great destructivist ideas of those great 'thinkers'. but i digress. this has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about, but rather what the movie is.sure, it seems hard to earn a living in a hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post-post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. it has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not. and so a new studio product is born! indie films, which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as hollywood films to sell to indie film markets. an indie film must sell at sundance before becoming 'acclaimed'. and so nothing is simple anymore. even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky. whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story--and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are borne--filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost; films have to make people think, have to be meaningful, has to be provocative, raise questions, yadda yadda yadda. what it all boils down to, is a subversion of the hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of hollywood films, the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same product.and i haven't even begun on the film yet. maybe i've become too picky on films i see these days. maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than, say, be probed when seeing a movie. but hell, this movie is one big load of crap. and i'm repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the how to make a good movie good 101 guidebook to the t--characters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like they're gifted with the speech of god; it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in america; it has 'touching' moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient/new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know you're in for all of the above traits.and something about the aforementioned point--about it raising questions about immediately-compelling issues like racism--pisses me off big time. like all post-post-post-post-post everything movies, it doesn't contend with just having a message about this issue. because oh, our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post-post-post-post world. our audiences want us to make them think, doesn't want us to put things so simplistically, (and then they will go into existentialist crap and say) that's because life itself isn't simplistic. ha ha ha. what other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them. okay, okay, and okay. so the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non-messages and since they're not exactly a message, it's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right? so we're being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. and as if the irony is not steep enough, we have ludicrous' character, the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously, being 'converted' into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end, giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to 'learn something about themselves too'. um, yeah. how i wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man.to cut the long bullshit short, i guess i wouldn't have taken issue with the film if it wasn't so bloated in its self-importance. the angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white-boy whining than actual spike lee-ish anger. it's so tim robbins and sean penn, the type that wants to wave flags about humanitarianism when the only thing they don't realize is the flag they're waving is their hole-ridden underwear. plus it's become so trendy in the post-post-post-post world to be completely subtle about it. nothing is simple any longer. in its best efforts to actually be good, provocative, and ultimately human, it's become neither, imho, just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie-filmmaker. now at least hollywood is more simple and sincere in its manipulativeness.

'bland' is probably the word i'd use to try and start describing this film. i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let down.basically the film is about racism in a post 9/11 america and the director went at it with a sledge hammer! there was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of magnolia feel to the film - which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the end...all in all a huge disappointment.

this movie was offensively pc, predictable and clichéd. i couldn't imagine a movie that better exemplifies the myopic, narcissistic preachiness of today's hollywood. if you haven't seen this don't bother watching it. if you have, show some courage and tell people how awful it really is. my wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the inherent and unendingly racist message of the film. this movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little, if anything at all, to add to any discussion about racism in this country. instead, it's the kind of cheap, sensationalist crap that is promoted as deep and challenging thought. what kind of a bubble do you have to live in to think that this is at all impressive?

crash is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. a great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. it feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. sure, race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue, but the universe of 'crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. it's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. i found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. the fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on imdb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by hollywood malarkey.indeed, if you want the real "crash," go check out the one by david cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. this film plays as preachy, tiresome, and masochistic.

terrible writing, highly contrived, from a "do-gooder" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in l.a., or the usa in the present day. the gushing positive reviews are a mystery to me - but could only be provided by folks who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded regardless of how shallow, simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results are. if you want to see a film which deals realistically with modern day l.a. race issues - the movie you need to see (and probably already saw) is pulp fiction. there's more honesty and realism regarding race in any two minutes of that film than there are in the full 4 hours (oh i'm sorry, it just felt like 4 hours) of this stinker. if anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is paved with good intentions - then this is the movie for you.

the good: the acting were great especially terrence howard and thandie newton. terrence howard should have been nominated for best supporting actor instead of matt dillon.the bad: i'm a visible minority (non-white) and i have experienced some form of racism in my life. but despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter, i would definitely not say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's far from it. i have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. some of my problems with this movie are:(1) poor character development (or none at all). just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, matt dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. yes, i admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, but that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.(2) the dialogue seems really contrived to the point that i'm really surprised this movie won for best original screenplay. they should show this movie in a screenplay writing class not because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what not to do. i just felt like i've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. i get it.(3) the plot seems so coincidental, it is laughable. what are the chances of a black car robber running over an asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? if it was that simple, why don't we throw every racist in america down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?(4) i think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. as someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. i've been refused to enter a supermarket because i'm not white. did the store owner said because i was not white? no, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. did he yell racial slurs? no. racism in america is more hidden. some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. if a chinese woman rear-ended me, i won't be saying "blake! blake! learn some english bitch!". on the other hand, if i was a chinese woman and i accidentally rear-ended a mexican woman, i won't say "mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. that's not how things work. instead, i would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow chinese friends and family that mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. that is the real racism. it's hidden and not in your face.anyway, crash is not original unlike what some people may say. the interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots, and characters have been done before. "magnolia" is a movie that does this much better than crash did and yet, it was never nominated for best picture at the oscars. it had a stellar cast -- julianne moore, william h. macy, phillip seymour hoffman (who won best actor recently), tom cruise, etc. it really boggles my mind how crash was even nominated for best picture.

what a disappointment. the story line is so simple - "the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things" - dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever, sophisticated and meaningful. it isn't. it lacks any subtlety.everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation.for a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character's actions.half way through i really wanted to waste no more time on it, but i thought i would stick with it in case it improved; big mistake i should have stopped then - it simply got worse.

i am amazed anyone likes this film. i never walk out of movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. the white characters are saints and the asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless to the story. they exist only as objects, surprise. characters of other races fare much better. the twists and turns were laughable and predictable. but if you're reading this, you know that already. paul haggis is a hack. hollywood can't even do multicultural movies right. do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest take on race relations, harold and kumar go to white castle!

i wrote this as a two part review. part two has spoilers.part 1: no, this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. this is the one about racism in l.a. you know, the one where everybody is a racist, and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. race.its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. race. racist. racism. race relations. relay race.paul haggis made a movie which took the structure of magnolia, which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a 1'53" mental vomit about racism in america. race. in the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. the first hour, people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in america.for example, the story with ludicrous and larenz tate provides the comic relief. too bad, the first half of their story is lifted straight from the bonnie situation in pulp fiction. racism. their section is the quentin tarantino section where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. constantly. the other good thing about it is the mexican story when the mexican guy is talking to his daughter. he gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.the rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. the hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. the scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. why would anybody act like that? is it realistic? nooo. it reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from the doom generation. "six dollar sixty six cents girly." if i ever watch the second half of the movie, i hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.i haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. race. racism. race for the sun. better. then, there is the black guy who wants to be white, matt dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, ryan phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. when matt dillon molests the black producers wife, could i help it if i was cracking up? when philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism, can i help but crack up? the movie is so funny when it is being racist. racist. racist i tell you.now, mind you, this movie was nominated for best picture, best director, best screenplay, and best editing, besides a nod to matt dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. who was paid off for that one, i have no clue.don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.d- part 2:the second half of crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive, conclusionary, the world is a big coincidence kind of way. and it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.take 1999's magnolia. people weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. they were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. you know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.the stories are lined up so everybody meets again. are there only 5 on the lapd force? aren't these people working weird shifts? dillon and philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? and, why did tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? wouldn't it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? like phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. everybody'd be freaking out.eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the hindi to shoot the daughter. it ticked me off and made me feel dirty. not that the hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. it really ticked me off. at the writers, not the scene.the whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. the coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. unlike magnolia which was connected mildly, this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. the only good part in the second half was when sandra bullock falls down the stairs. she doesn't die though. she should have. i cheered when she fell.the worst part about the movie is it pulls a magnolia. not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song in the deep where you see everybody being depressed. magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to aimee mann's wise up. unfortunately, magnolia came out in 1999, while crash came out in 2005. its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. somehow.utter waste of my time.first half: d-; second half: lowest grade ever; overall: f---

i can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. i had great expectations for it and was disappointed. first of all, they used every cheesy racism cliché in the book. it was so predictable. for instance, from the second the young latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. matt dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. the predictability hardly ended with those characters. a phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. the morals of the story were pc to the max. there were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. the dialouge was embarrassing at times. it wasn't all bad.i just can't believe this movies high score so far. it was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. i admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short.

*** spoilers***one of the worst films i've seen since last years "the village." an insult to anyone of any intelligence at all. poorly written and astonishingly contrived. nobody, especially in los angeles talks the way these characters do. no subtly at all. if the point of this film is to say that "we all have a little bit of bigotry in us" he does a horrible job of stating the obvious. not only was his point clearly base, but every character in this film was amazingly stupid. the car jacking scene almost made me walk out, along with the rescue and oh lets not forget the white off duty rookie cop picking up a hitchhiking black thug and... i could go on and on. awful, just awful.

i agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. it is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. i want to comment on the matt dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that "we're all a little racist" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. he does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. this behavior is not a little racist. this behavior is evil. it is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a little racist. later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? and is dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? please. the fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.

the film's tagline is "you think you know who you are. you have no idea." i reject both the suggested idea that i have no idea who i am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are. if people in real life are really like this, then man, we're screwed.a bilious film that i walked into late and left prematurely. a film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming the race film of all time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use.the rules of hollywood are such: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half. the rules of hollywood are to make dialog 'real' - a concept which changes with every decade. is this 'real dialog' somehow less ludicrous than the 'real dialog' of kevin smith ten years ago? the rules of hollywood state that we set the scene, and as action rises, the camera moves in closer to the faces - in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. the strings increase, the frame-rate slows down, and our heart is meant to break.this film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid. i have my own prejudices against l.a., which i freely admit, so to combat this prejudice i will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location, but rather probably from the author and director. the writer, paul haggis, already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his million dollar baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script's ideas. now that paul haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true, natural human drama, he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well. paul haggis comes from the land of tv, let us not forget: the land of diminished expectations.everything is as obvious as a tv-movie, simply presented for simple minds - haggis drills into us, over and over again, that while on the surface people may seem to be awful, they have secret pains hidden. this is a nice idea, but so hamfistedly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad/good has an amateurish feel. structurally the film is broken up, in the tradition of magnolia and other earlier films. the editing is as typical and conventionally "cinematic" as could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera, the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality. the problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept by the books. not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence.the film tries desperately to present reality, but there's just no talent whatsoever. some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all of the performance get muddied together, brought down by the low, low aesthetics of the film. we have cinematography which is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. however, not only is the cinematography unremarkable, but it is thoughtless camera-work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired. the result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos. for example - and this is a spoiler - as a father holds his dying child (the father might be shot too, i didn't stick around to find out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous vertigo track/zoom. the vertigo shot!!! it was at this point that the film became hysterical and i just had to leave. i had to leave because it was so bad. i left because i was in the middle of a crowded theater, and i wanted to express to the audience that i was sick of emptyheaded hollywood 'art' which is full of sound and fury, yet signifying nothing (in the bard's own words). i hate to waste such good shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad.

i saw this "movie" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix, and from it i leaned a valuable lesson. not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson i learned is "don't trust reviews".yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it. the only reason that i can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking, or who've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that haggis invented the concept. in fact, he basically made this film, which should be called "racism for dummies", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. zen and the art of motorcycle maintanence it's not... an after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection.it's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. let's face it people. nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). it's well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think to ask "where's the beef?" until you can tell the film is winding down. the flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end. the messages are very heavy-handed, and from the "behind the scenes" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. i have to stress that this is not entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the "blood on the highway" of racism. they could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the "side-nude" shot of jennifer esposito.in this film, everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for michael pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline).this is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.

i get the impression that i was watching a different movie to the majority of other people i know who have seen this film. it's not really that i found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. i really respected paul haggis' work on the million dollar baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. it was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of traffic, but i don't think traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. the worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. does haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on farhad's dashboard, withthe address circled in black texta? can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? i also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. i have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even though people may not speak this way, they certainly do think this way. that is irrelevant. it is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. these characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of every scene, doesn't it become innately racist itself? characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. it's utterly unconvincing and obvious. a film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. i can see that haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but dare i suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome its flaws. i really hope that writer/directors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. it has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. and robert altman will not be outdone in that department.

for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series. it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander, starring kenneth brannagh. people interviewed by the police are hardy, and often as bitter as the weather, the lead investigator has huge family problems, investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past, and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end. both have excellent cinematography.the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series. effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel.really the script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter. you get even the most familiar of motifs, such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath, who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview.i'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk, but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television. what i felt a keen lack of was message. the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland. icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world, presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept, and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding, and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map, instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies). a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland. due to privacy concerns this project was terminated, and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland. the episode is a rich topic for debate.but in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education's sake, they're there for weird atmosphere.it's a grisly movie if you are interested in that, and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events, like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions. the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head. unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical. the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental, and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end. this is the equivalent, in cinematic terms, of attempting to prepare fugu, if you're not well-qualified, deft of hand and sharp of eye, you poison the client. this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance.i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general.

why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self-conscious movie? every now and then, after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting, we start getting bits and pieces of the big band swing that made tommy and jimmy dorsey, separately and together, the great musicians they were. occasionally -- in a jam session with art tatum, with tommy dorsey and his orchestra doing "marie" and, a standout, jimmy dorsey and his orchestra fronting bob eberle and helen o'connell singing "green eyes" -- we get a complete song. unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the dvd transfer is just as bad as the acting. my copy has only four chapter stops. that means you can get arthritis in your fast- forward finger trying to speed through to where the good stuff is. the swamp you're moving through is hollywood's version of the life and battles of the two dorseys. tommy, superb on trombone, and jimmy, superb on saxophone, usually couldn't stand each other. in 1935 they finally split, with tommy starting his own orchestra. each had greater success alone than they had achieved together. they reconciled when their father died in the forties, which is where the movie ends. they later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by tommy as the big band era faded out in the fifties. tommy died in 1956 at age 51, vomiting in his sleep after booze, pills and a big meal. jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957. jimmy was hugely talented and, from all accounts, a reasonably easy-going guy. tommy was hugely talented and, from all accounts, often an overbearing jerk. but good music makes up for a lot of faults, and the big band sounds the two created helped define the swing era. they play themselves in the movie, and we see them develop from tussling tykes (with child actors) to grown men battling and yammering at each other. the movie is lumbered with not just their two parents, played by those hollywood irish clichés, sara allgood and arthur shields, who just want their boys to get along with each other, but also with a major sub- story involving a romance between janet blair, as a childhood friend of the dorseys who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as a nearly full-time mediator and enabler, and william lundigan, as a piano player. blair is not bad at all. however, if you want to see why she never became the star she quite probably should have become, just look at the films, like this one, that her studio put her in. no wonder she left hollywood. lundigan simply takes up space. how bad is this movie, other than when we can actually hear the dorseys play? well, here's a song written especially for the movie and given to blair to warble. it's called "to me." to me...you're the rose of a rosary...the rise of a rising sea...the glow of a star... the rose of a rosary? the movie doesn't get any better than this, and it can't get worse. still, if you like the dorseys and if the price is right...well, in hindsight i'd still not buy it. the highlight, for me, is eberle and o'connell singing "green eyes." you can watch them on you tube for free. you'll also find there quite a bit of each of the dorseys. i wish i'd known.

i have to agree that the movie is not the best i've ever seen, but i would like to make mention that the actors portraying tommy and jimmy dorsey were the actual dorsey brothers. as actors, they were wonderful musicians. the movie, based on their famous split, would have been better had professional actors played the parts. many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of big bands. most often, the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade. most of the movie-going audience didn't go to see tommy or jimmy dorsey playing themselves; they went for the plot and the music. i've never been much of a dorsey fan, but the music is good even today.i have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played mom and pop dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a dublin audience. arthur shields and sara allgood were actually irish actors, both born in dublin. you might remember mr. shields as the reverend mr. playfair in the quiet man and ms. allgood as mrs. monahan in cheaper by the dozen.

upon writing this review i have difficulty trying to think of what to write about. nothing much happens in this film. the storyline is a south asian woman who falls for an english londoner. the problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. at the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother, and it just escalates from there. the problem is that this movie is very predictable. as soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard. it drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long. this is more of a chick flick than anything else. so if you're male i do not recommend this film to you.

i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie. i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community. it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course. i'm always sceptical of "improvisation", another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story. racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel.

that's what i kept asking myself during the many fights, screaming matches, swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes. the comparisons also stand up when you think of the one-dimensional characters, who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them. they are just badly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs on, a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinema.i must confess, i'm not really one for spotting bad performances during a film, but it must be said that nichola burley (as the heroine's slutty best friend) and wasim zakir (as the nasty, bullying brother) were absolutely terrible. i don't know what acting school they graduated from, but if i was them i'd apply for a full refund post haste. only samina awan in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of so-called british talent that we'll probably never hear from again. at least, that's the hope. next time, hire a different scout.another intriguing thought is the hideously fashionable soundtrack featuring the likes of snow patrol, ian brown and keane. now, i'm a bit of a music fan and i'm familiar with most of these artists output, but i didn't recognise any of the tracks during this movie (apart from the omnipresent "run"). b-sides, anyone? we get many, many musical montages which telegraph how we're suppose to feel. these are accompanied by such startlingly original images as couples kissing by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways. this is a problem, as none of the songs convey the mood efficiently, and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone.the ending is presumably meant to be just desserts, as everybody gets their comeuppance and there is at least one big shock in store.. but i remained resolutely unmoved because the script had given me no-one to root for. it's not enough to tackle a hot-button issue, you have to actually give us a plot that hasn't already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing. as it stands, this film is a noble failure, with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly diverting punch-ups to save it from the bin. 4/10. must try harder..

the whole movie was done half-assed. it could have been a much better movie but, that would have required a re-write and different actors. compared to "traffic" this was a wreck. i am just glad i didn't have to pay for it.spoiler:what was the point of having crooked cops getting arrested? to share the guilt of drug dealers and make them feel better? pu-leaze! the parents were scum, driven by greed, and didn't even consider the harm they were doing; as pointed out by ice-t. 2 out of 10

awful! awful! awful! drab, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. exactly the sort of film the irish film industry shouldn't be making. and with the added bonus of a treacle-coated ending. a sickening example of how talent & originality is by-passed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity. yes - the children are sweet. yes - it almost looks like it's done professionally. but this is film making by numbers, a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is 'success' - a film which patronises and despises the audience. it's quite amazing that working title would pour £3m into this rubbish. but then, they paid for love actually. don't waste your money.

egads.i used to think keannu reeves was the worst actor in hollywood. i not so sure anymore, willy gives keannu some stiff competition with his "i'm made of plaster" performance in this movie.combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot, and not a single likable character, and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey.natasha tries her best, but even julia roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity.avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on. -oh heck, in that case just read a book.

brief marital infidelity comes back to haunt loving wife grace needham (portrayed by the always sexy nastassja kinski).she had left town, and her depressing husband, to embark on a trip to sunny miami, where she was pursued and ultimately seduced by julian grant, a handsomely evil and manipulative business executive, who is portrayed very well by william baldwin (why do all of the baldwin brothers play evil people so damn well?)the seducing of grace took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach they reached privately by sailboat. grace admitted she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage. julian gained her confidence by claiming he would never allow those types of problems to occur, if he had a relationship with grace. julian's manipulation continued as he described a "lost at sea" fantasy involving the now uninhibited grace, who sat near, listening to his every word and becoming more and more engaged with his romantic dream.his manipulation paid off as a few subtle nudges led to grace's soft kisses, paused momentarily by her pulling back as if suddenly thinking to herself `what am i doing? i'm a wife. i'm a mother. i have a real life. real responsibilities. sure, the two of us have talked about being together, lost at sea, but that is just a fantasy. look at what we're doing here. the consequences are real. we're really alone on a secluded beach. am i going to let this fantasy really happen?'she succumbs to the dream, as her kisses became more passionate. the once guarded grace, who used to respond to men's propositions by saying "i'm married" enjoyed watching as julian unbuttoned her shirt, leading to more kisses, body caresses and her climbing onto julian's lap! she smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and frequently looks up at the sun throughout what unfortunately was a brief love-making scene in which everybody seemed to have most of their clothes on.while i thoroughly enjoyed the look of illicit passion on grace's face as the once devoted wife was being thoroughly satisfied by having sex with a man that clearly enjoys manipulating others, i will say that on the whole, the scene was undeserving of the movie's "r" rating.julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated from his securing of a high paying job, and she is excited about being able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving wife and caring mother.but the evil julian grant reenters the picture and is not willing to give up so easily on grace. grace has a plan to rid her life of julian, but will it work?obviously, i don't want to ruin the remaining story line for you. however, i will say that i always enjoy movies involving sexual pretense by a wife (especially when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that is normally reserved for her husband) but in actuality, is seeking revenge against the antagonist. this movie would have been much, much better if the movie had included more of that in the story line. my feelings are if the movie brings it up, then the movie should finish it. and this movie definitely brought it up. unfortunately, certain constraints in the story line prevented this from being significantly pursued. there are many other movies available that succeed with that very point, and i'll include their titles in the "recommendations" portion of this section. i'm also open to receiving emailed suggestions of other movies that contain a good story line involving sexual pretense on the part of a seemingly devoted wife.overall, nastassja kinski and william baldwin are both very good. the movie is not.

we've seen a story like this before: a wife in marital troubles (played by nastassja kinski) engages in sex with a stranger (william baldwin) and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl. when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job. everything seems bright. however, kinski finds out that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants. what to do? say nothing?i didn't really like the movie. while it wasn't just bad, it clearly lacked "that something". maybe it should've focused more on what's going inside kinski's head. nothing to say about the actors themselves (i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss) but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical, acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films. finally, the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot.in my opinion the movie tried to look cool, it had a bit of shaky camerawork here and there, some stills, fast cuts and glamour, but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better. same goes for the music. otherwise it didn't look that bad.some might like this but it definitely wasn't my cup of tea. to be fair, i don't usually watch much this type of thrillers. this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long, i think it could've worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series. there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes, especially the shower scene.my advice: try before you buy!

fc de kampioenen's only reason for existence is it's local popularity. it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years (and still counting).it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis "amateur". every storyline deals with the same subject: some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions, to get resolved in the end.the show's been running for over 15 years now, and the production probably decided not to change a winning team. which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years (besides a couple of actors getting replaced (they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show)). the humor hasn't changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place.i guess you have to be flemish to get this, and over 60 years old, to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this.

i know, it's a movie. but when it comes to portray real life (in any matter) it should be as faithful as possible. i'm sorry, but "el misterio galíndez" isn't as accurate as it seems. nor is the dominican republic depicted as it really is. in fact, it shocked me to see that the filming location for santo domingo was actually cuba. and incredibly enough, movies with cuban themes (havana, the lost city, bitter sugar, the godfather part ii) were actually filmed in santo domingo! so what happened here? why did they shoot the movie in cuba instead of the d.r.? the spanish dialogs with the cuban accent are horrible! those are not dominicans! on the historic level, galíndez would have never been hanged. he might as well been shot, decapitated or died from the inhumane torture he'd been receiving. then, thrown his body in the caribbean sea. but trujillo would have never ordered death by strangulation. his sick mind wouldn't have allowed it.acting isn't delivered as expected. harvey keitel looks like he's just expecting a paycheck. i prefer the leading actress in "deep blue sea". the rest of the cast would have been excellent in some cuban movie, and the same goes for the selected shooting location.i suggest "la fiesta del chivo" (the feast of the goat), from bestselling author mario vargas llosa, directed by his cousin luis llosa. it's a bit more realistic with dominican history. the trujillo character is very well portrayed, and the galindez incident is treated very briefly in this movie.

this is by far the worst film i have ever seen it has next to no plot and the plot it does have is very scattered. the story line is lacking in both content, suspense and subtitles, as what would appear to be story line is in russian. the set appears to be only one room with various lighting effects and at the moment you think something good is about to happen you are let down by the total lack of acting, drama, suspense, horror, gore, story line and mythology. the directing style has been done to death(the fisheye camera). it would seem that the only action in this film is within the last 10 - 15 minutes and the action is made worse by the actors inability to portray the suspense correctly. the only interesting thing about this movie was my dog barking at the surround sound.

val kilmer is almost nowhere in this film -lucky for him! he plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. after seeing the film i couldn't tell you what "role" he plays in the film!!?? ok... they suck you in the first hour by immersing you in dark underground tunnels. spooky movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily suck most people in to last the first 30 minutes to an hour. then you will begin wondering, "why am i watching this?" i remember thinking how easy it must be for a director/writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a film. simply film people wandering around in dark tunnels and you have instant "suspense". but that is where this movie goes no further! we all wonder what goes bump in the night, but there is nothing out there in the dark in this film but more darkness. the story is even worse. apparently there is an underlying story to the film that i learned of "after" watching the film. but the film uses such poor dialouge that it never came across clearly during the screening. i still don't understand what the writer/director meant to say. some children trapped underground by a misled sister in russia? why? are they in our time -the same time as the characters? are they ghosts? this was an absolutely horrible film that drew me to write my first imdb review to warn others to avoid it.

it seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching. the acting was flat and the story lacked depth. there was too much reliance on camera work, which had some high points. i have to agree with the other negative comments. i only wish i had read them before buying the dvd. the film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand. there could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in moscow (i.e. post-soviet 'capitalism', rampant drug usage (i.e. increased heroin trafficking from afghanistan); more development of why the resurgence of russian orthodoxy after the fall of the u.s.s.r.; the archaeologists themselves; or even more into the struggle against nihilism.

this movie is total dreck. i love val kilmer and was very surprised earlier this year by "felon" (a good movie!). the entire dvd box is misleading. val kilmer while being billed as one of the main people in this film, is in the movie for about 2 minutes. even the summary on the back of the dvd is not entirely true. this could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. usually when a movie is this horrendous you can sit back and laugh at it. this film though is so bad and boring i actually fell asleep to it (which i never do during a movie). avoid at all costs!

wow.. where do i begin. i rented this movie because it sounded like something i would be interested in watching. with a name like val kilmer starring in this film, i thought how bad could it be? this has got to be the worst film i have ever seen with such a big name attached to it. i was wondering why it slipped through the cracks and i never remember hearing anything about it when it first came out. it starts out pretty good, and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro sequence in the bourne identity, but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then it ventures into wtf land. if you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor and don't rent/buy it unless you are a masochist or on a quest to see every val kilmer film out there. there are many more titles out there that are more deserving your time. this film (if you can call it that) is a bona fide waste of time. i want my 82 minutes back.

i can't remember the worst film i have watched.total waste of actors and audience time.if you prefer sitting by your tv and think when will be this film over,then this is the right film for you.maybe this film is recorded to make people believe that moscow has some mystique past. but i must say i have not expect anything else from rade serbedzija,but i have expected more from vincent gallo.the film lacks a plot, character,development,denouement.entire movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique.i must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poor.over and over are the same pictures.total waste of time.

while in madrid i was able to see a screener copy of this film. wow! gallo is amazing in it. very unusual performance he gives. aside from gallo's genius, the film however is a dull a film i have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on laughable. i am also a val kilmer fan so he was part of the reason i made such a grand effort to view the film. the problem is val is really only in one scene. having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast. i have only seen stranded of the directors other films. both films are far far below average but both contain very interesting vincent gallo performances. if you are as much as a gallo fan as i then see this film regardless of how bad it is. if you do not like gallo then there is zero left to love.

if they had a zero out of 10 i would of entered it. everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public. i don't know how films like this get released video or pay channel. i am disappointed in vincent gallo. val kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes, so i can't get that mad at him. only the person who listed him to be the star in it. it is like marlon brando in superman.there is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs. why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows. they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night. there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written. i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain.

i was hooked in by the premise that the show was about demons. from hell. and a doorway to hell. what i didn't realize was that i would be watching some guys run around tunnels chased by small children who may / may not have been demons for the entire movie. sure there was some dialogue in between, and great underground scenery but the lack of a plot, developed characters, any twists or development in the story at all was sorely lacking. oh, and out of interest, there were no special effects. the entire budget was spent on actors salaries, sets and lots of time running around with a camera underground.the ending was one of the typical lackluster boring endings that makes you say "i endured this film of boredom for that!?" if you want to see demons and a doorway to hell, i promise you that you would be better off served watching the trailers to the game hellgate : london which while shorter than this movie at 5 minutes, pack more dialogue, character development, action, plot and satisfying conclusions than this.the second star is for effort, but overall a low score for failing to make a movie that stands out, and for promising in the tagline much more than what was delivered.

moscow zero stole my money and i want it back! this is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie. yes, this movie is a horror. horrifyingly bad. after many years of lurking here at imdb, i am actually moved to set up an account just so i (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people do not watch this movie! it will steal your soul, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.seriously, i'd love to hear the director's voice over on an "enhanced" dvd (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking. the producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the val kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.i actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the russian dialog. not that it mattered much. straining to hear the russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.i will give this movie a "1" because i cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing. it somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie not feel claustrophobic. now that's a dubious achievement.here's your spoiler: and the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming. the "climax" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape i have ever seen on film. exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.

the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film, then closed again.watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen, like all other movies. nothing makes sense in this movie.it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems. in fact, except as a warning, it really isn't worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this film.from now on, i will check imdb before watching any film.hot darn, imdb is forcing me to write more about this film. i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it. but if you had to chose between the two, pick edison force.

the gate to hell has opened up under moscow. a priest, played by vincent gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway. wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic. good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting. i've watched this twice now and i still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms. nothing is clear and honestly i didn't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved (second billed val kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film.) the idea is really good, the performances are fine, the script goes nowhere. take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don't cross the river to see this.

this line is a good summary of this movie. if you have read it, and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave. some researcher named surgei (pronounced sirgay) are searching for hell in the underworld of moscow. however he seems to have disappeared, and his friend oven follows with a team to search after him. could they have find a more boring plot? some bad actors looking after an old man in the underground. the acting is very bad, the romance really feels pointless and untrue, often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting, nothing is scary and most of all: there's not happening anything interesting in the whole, entire movie. they just walk, asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way, walk some more, complain some, finds the old man, and then they run, and finally finds the way out of the underground.the only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere. if you just want to see a movie for that, this may be a good choice. it's dark, and it's mystical and murky. however, the rest of the movie is really dull. you just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to begin or something to happening. it's actually happening some things, but they are not very well performed. for example, i didn't really notice when one of the characters disappeared, and i swear i wasn't sleeping or something. and i don't understand what's dangerous with these children... they just run around in the underground together, scratching it walls with sticks (i suppose it is meant to be scary in some way).just watch this movie if you are in immediate need of some murky atmospheres.

i suffered the watching of this movie at sitges festival last month. if there would be a possibility of "unfilm" a movie to avoid its existence, this should be the first in the list. maría lidón isn't a director, she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout "action" makes her a professional film maker. what a mistake! the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project. val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera. his character don't have specific weight in the movie. the same thing can tell about joss ackland, vincent gallo or joaquim de almeida. it's a shame the way rade serbedzija's character has been written. warning spoilershe spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way (now i'm doing this, now i'm low of bats, i'll search in my bag, now i'm turning left, now i'm turning right...) only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions. it's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director. end of spoilersthe usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it: zero

i never made any comment here on imdb, but as i saw this movie, i cant be quiet. i just set up my account here only because this horrible movie. in two words, this movie is pure crap. the movie has no sense at all! nothing makes sense in this movie. watching this movie was pain all the way. i don't understand why val kilmer agreed to do this movie. he plays a minor role as a gang leader, says few words, and he is there like 5 minutes total.i bought this dvd based only because of val kilmer name on the box and the interesting pictures on the cover.as was stated in other review, moscow zero stole my money and i want it back!!! the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it: zero

this may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is absolutely the most boring. wonder why it is shot mostly in the dark, and mostly with vincent gallo walking away from the camera, or looking down? because he doesn't want to show his face for actually agreeing to being in this movie. i liked his early stuff, but the pretentiousness of the "brown bunny" and then being cast in this drivel knocked him down a peg in my book. and val kilmer? i actually want to send him a sympathy card. the "doors" to this??? actually the casting was the only reason i watched this movie, and val doesn't even show up until the movie is more than halfway over. simply a sad movie.

there are good movies, and there are bad movies, and then there's moscow zero, a film so utterly bad it makes spending a month in solitary with an insurance salesman an attractive entertainment alternative.with an incomprehensible plot about the gates of hell opening within a labyrinth of tunnels under moscow, the film is a mess of repetitive and nonsensical shots of a little girl running through tunnels, red lights floating about, and strange wall shadows, none of which serves to mount any fear or tension, but instead elicits the reaction of "here they go again with the girl (or lights)" from the viewer.directed by maría lidón, who for reasons i can only conclude as shame, was billed as luna, the movie stars vince gallo as owen, an american priest who travels to moscow in search of sergei (rade serbedzija), a friend and colleague who has gone missing in the tunnels. he enlists the help of a series of locals who, with the exception of oksana akinshina, are all portrayed by spanish actors trying with limited success to inflect russian accents.along the way they cross paths with members of some sort of underground leather-coated religious mafia headed by a portly val kilmer, whose career seems to be in such free fall that he's resorted to appearing in dreck like this, and henchman sage stallone (sly's son), who seems to have been cast merely so the stallone name can be included in the film's marquee.apart from watching the troupe try to navigate their way through the tunnels with the aid of a comically drawn map, and repetitive shots of them being followed or eluded by a pale faced young girl, not much else goes on throughout. dialogue routinely switches between english and russian, with actors frequently taking turns in each language, and entire conversations are uttered half in one and half in the other with the only apparent reason being they felt like it, adding a frustrating dimension for the viewer, over and above trying to figure out the crazily cobbled together story.about the only thing moscow zero gets right, however, is its title, which could only have rendered a more accurate description of this movie if the word moscow had been omitted.

sit in your basement with the light out for an hour and a half. that's about the same as watching this subterranean search for the devil's door. an american researcher owen(vincent gallo)travels to moscow and gathers a rescue team to search for his friend sergei(rade serbedzia), an archaeologist who has disappeared in the catacombs beneath russia's capital city. they will be shocked to discover subterranean dwellers thriving in the dank and dark complex system of caves and tunnels. the searchers will come upon the gatekeeper of hell, andrey(val kilmer), and will strike a deal to continue their venture; only to succeed in being scared almost witless when realizing they are among walking dead. also in the cast: joaquin de almedia, oksana akinshina, sage stallone, joss ackland and julio perillan.

after watching this film i decided that it was so awful that i must join imdb and write a review to warn other people of the pit falls of renting/buying this film. to be fair to the film there is only one good section to this film and that is the end credits cause then you know that this crap is well and truly over. i watched it to the end in the hope that i may get a little bit of pleasure out of the film. just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself (if you watch this film too many time so will you). as for val if he keeps selecting films like this he may as well kiss goodbye to his acting career. there is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done. keep your money and sanity and keep well clear.

in moscow, the priest owen (vincent gallo) hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend sergei (rade serbedzija) that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city. i bought this dvd based on the name of val kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. i am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i do not understand how val kilmer accepted to participate in this production. there are two shameful reviews in imdb promoting this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review in this site. there are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film: my wife and i napped many times because of the monotony of this pointless story, and we used the rewind button of the dvd to repeat each lost scene. however, the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button, to end this crap faster. my vote is one.title (brazil): "cidade sombria" ("dark city")

the plot in this movie is very thin, and there is not much acting. val kilmer--i don't know why he agreed to do this movie--plays a minor role as a gang leader. in short, the movie is tedious to watch.one guy, who sort of resembles an archeology/religion professor, is exploring a subterranean area of moscow, that has some history connected to railway construction and the bolshevik revolution. a church tragedy in that history makes the exploration "spiritual" and spirits of a malevolent intent haunt the underground ruins. a friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of russian guides. the entire movie is based on this plot and contains much repeated footage of the underground, and some camera effects; much like those seen in "day watch", "night watch", etc.

i like 50s sci-fi movies a lot. i like the really good ones (such as the day the earth stood still, when worlds collide, invasion of the body snatchers, and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends (such as plan 9 from outer space). however, when a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun, it really should be avoided. this movie is just such a film. the posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she-beast is attacking mankind, whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting. a woman is married to a womanizer. she is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that's about it. also, many of the special effects really stink--especially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby.

a woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, helped no doubt by a smooth-talking gigolo husband who openly cheats on her. naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been accosted by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite. much to the delight of her husband, this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good. from the very opening scenes, with it's ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter, you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny. although not too far off the mark, this is most definitely not true.unlike most movies of this genre, this is not really a sci-fi or a horror film, but actually a serious drama which intelligently incorporates a sci-fi scenario into the plot. it's not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you weren't expecting any legitimate drama at all. the acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and, most importantly, it is well edited and excellently paced. it is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next. nevertheless, this is still a movie strictly for those who can't pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like "attack of the 50 foot woman"!

i’d been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the worst film ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci-fi cinema in a british periodical from the early 1980s entitled “the movie” (incidentally, the leonard maltin film guide also awarded this the unenviable bomb rating). when it came out on dvd last year, i became interested in purchasing the “cult camp classics” box set in which it was included (along with queen of outer space [1958] and the giant behemoth [1959]); however, since recently acquiring queen on dvd-r, i had put paid to the idea.happily, i’ve just stumbled upon the film on divx – however, the print wasn’t culled from the warners dvd (which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasant-looking transfer) but rather a muddy tv print…though not so much that the detail is lost (in other words, it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to black-and-white!). anyway, to get to the matter at hand: i have to admit that, in a way, i was disappointed the film didn’t prove to be the laugh-fest i had anticipated all this time (maltin calls it “hilariously awful”); actually, i found it quite engaging – and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length. some undeniably amusing bits remain though – such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman, and when the sheriff’s deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading lady’s butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case. neither did the special effects hit me as being “among the funniest” (maltin again) on film – though they’re certainly embarrassingly bad! o.k., so the idea that an alien (in giant-sized human form, clad in cave-man rags, and radioactive to boot!) coming to earth in a big ball-shaped(!) spaceship and apparently after the heroine’s prized necklace is utter nonsense – and his quasi-transparent appearance does it no favors at all…but, really, it’s the human story that holds our attention (relatively speaking). the character of the philandering husband isn’t very interesting, but his two women are: wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife allison hayes and ambitious, vixenish girlfriend yvette vickers. also involved in the narrative are hayes’ faithful servant (already mentioned), a couple of cops (one of them, as noted elsewhere, being amiably goofy) and as many doctors (one of whom is named dr. cushing[!] and another a specialist who’s called in when hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation).of course, the film could be seen as the reversed female version of the incredible shrinking man (1957) – though it wouldn’t be fair to compare the two further, as the jack arnold/richard matheson classic is far more psychological/intellectual in approach; actually, hayes doesn’t seem to be that bothered with her ‘condition’ and, in fact, takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson! however, her rampage – exaggerated in movie posters of the era – is rather quaint (especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so); when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand (especially when lifting the puppet that’s supposed to be her husband!), she’s mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind (with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by)!! still, hayes’ demise via electrocution (when she bumps into an electrical cable) is competently done.finally, i followed this with its 1993 tv remake with daryl hannah as the titular creature – which i rented specifically for this purpose.

this turned out all right and looks interesting. however, as it goes on the attempts at creating emotions between the characters is so inept that it really turns the horror off and is an insult to serious viewers. the story this is based on "i walked with a zombie" is probably much better although unfortunately i haven´t seen it yet. "ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it has turned out very poorly which is a shame. it´s hard to say what is wrong with it. i guess there are just too many inept scenes and it is hard to believe, for example, in the lovestory between alice (who is called alice dodgson like the girl who supposedly inspired lewis carrol to call his heroine alice) and the younger brother. absolutely nothing has been built up between them and then in the end they get married. anyway, this looks great, and it was worth a look - but the movie is just so poorly performed. 3/10.

i can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash offended me. why is it that american filmmakers always go out of there way to portray jamaicans as a bunch of backwards ass bush babies and worse yet, cast people to play jamaicans who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent? we are not all extremely dark, we do not all walk around carrying machetes whether for work or protection, we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice voodoo!! we are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. i am sick and tired of watching all of these portrayals of jamaicans as a bunch of dreadlock wearing rastafarians who do nothing but sit around all day smoking weed on a beach or shooting guns in the air (when we're not living in our tree houses). yes, we wear clothes. yes, we have electricity. no, weed is not legal on the island and chances are we speak better english than you! the worst part is, this isn't just me being angry and bitter, these are actual answers to questions that most jamaicans who have traveled overseas have been asked at some point. read a book before you assume what's it's like in another country and worse yet, decide to make a movie about it.welcome to jamaica! the land where all we do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums...tales from the crypt has officially sickened me, along with the entire crew of people who worked on this garbage, especially the writer.

alice dodgson,a new york doctor gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug,resulting in the patient's death.without a job,alice is forced to go to jamaica,where she tends to the brother of a wealthy white landowner.the brother thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in the local people's voodoo practices and rituals."ritual" is a mediocre horror flick.the action is pretty dull,the plot twists are silly and there is no suspense.there is a bit of gore as someone is killing off white people with a machete,but not too much.the cinematography is decent,however the acting is truly woeful.definitely one to avoid.4 out of 10.

i was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released. i had to watch the film and later fill out a packet on my thoughts. it was the hardest thing to sit through on earth. the show just crawls by, and you quickly begin wishing you were dead. the thing is, there are two types of mormon films. the good ones with actual good stories, and the crappy ones that just plain stink. saints and soldiers, now there is a good movie. but, with these wannabe-comedies, the writers and the actors just try too hard. basically, they try to be funny when they are not. no wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films; they're filled with 'inside jokes' that aren't funny to begin with, and they just try to poke fun at average things. it's the story that makes the movie, and the stories for these movies are just weak. i bet you can guess what my packet looked like when i was told to fill it out after the movie. ;)

well...there were some great, creamy-smooth facial shots of marlene, along with her "shocking", gender-bender outfit (plus her not-to-be-missed "transmogrification" from ape into human being); but, overall, the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting -- not to mention the less than engaging tunes coming from miss dietrich's "baritone" voice --did little to ensure blonde venus a permanent place in my mind's pantheon of memorable films. cary grant -- still in the throes of cinematic infancy -- seemed as though he was forever looking to "find himself", while herbert marshall was probably never anything but herbert marshall from the day he was born, until the day he died. naturally, from an historical point of view, blonde venus was fun to watch, so long as one was able to put aside..."great expectations".

the seven collaborations between director joseph "von" sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone, and so different from anything else going on at the time, they almost seem to constitute a sub-genre of their own. like any genre, they have their outright masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. time to send blonde venus back to the farm.after the seedily seductive hits the blue angel, morocco and shanghai express, in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaret-singer-cum-prostitute, someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother. there is nothing wrong with that in itself; as an actress she was up to the part. it's just that nothing else about the format has changed. it's like the blue angel plus a kid. fair enough, the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama, but that's not the way this is played. dietrich's journey is played as some kind of adventure, using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. this is not some cheeky example of pre-code libertarianism  it is just bizarrely distasteful.although we may be able to accept marlene is a doting mommy, there is absolutely no way we can buy sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy. in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit, sternberg simply fails to get the story-arc. the film's emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family, but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to. as usual sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums. the faradays' home is actually quite a creepy, dingy environment, and it's a wonder little johnny wasn't wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light on.but as anyone familiar with them will know, the point of a dietrich/sternberg picture is to make dietrich look fabulous, and in this respect at least blonde venus is a success. marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright, shimmering close-up, and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her. the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast, whom sternberg tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery. the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shadows. even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring, background blob, and does not seem nearly interesting enough for dietrich to run off with.the only standout moments in blonde venus are marlene's song and dance routines, especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by emerging from a gorilla outfit. but even these feel like they have been cut-and-pasted from a different film. sternberg's fans may hail it as another masterpiece, as they are wont to do, but for the average punter it is a massive disappointment. audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits, and this heralded the beginning of the end for marlene's heyday. a year later there would be a new queen at paramount  mae west.

"you know - i've been in some towns where the girls weren't all that pretty. in fact i've been in some towns where they're downright ugly. but it's the first time i've been in a town where there are no girls at all" i am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to vin... one of the truly magnificent seven (from the first movie)...now i'd want to re-phrase him here. you know - i've seen some movies where the plot isn't all that good. in fact i've seen some movies where the plot is terrible, but that's first time in my life that i saw the film where there isn't any plot at all.ok. maybe my above statement is little bit over the top, but honestly... how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie. the bad guy (oh, don't ask me to give you his name, because i don't remember and his not even somehow close to calvera who's name and character is unforgettable...) is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons, that were killed in some battle, and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church...first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it... is it some egyptian pyramid or something? but ok, let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say few words about the seven itself...yul brynner's good old chris, always calm, always silent, talking less but talking wise is gone (unfortunately). oh no... he's as calm as he was... but now, he's calmness are so fake that you just don't buy it. (imagine, he meets a good old friend chico, who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few "hi, hello" and not even handshake (as far as i remember))... honestly, it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat, rather then meeting of chris and chico. that makes "new chris" more look like robocop or terminator rather then our beloved wise quickgun...i won't stop here talking about other characters. there simply aren't any... (imagine if strong actor like yul brynner is so much fake forgettable, then what will be other characters look like)...there still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them... for example one is women favorite guy, second is a man with dark past who's wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving... but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heart.i remember i was a little child and when o'reilly (charles bronson's character) died in the first movie i was crying. here, i just didn't care about each one of them... even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die, it seems i wouldn't care more...so, please, go and see this movie... i recommend it, because you won't have the other chance to see something worse then it.

the great yul brynner, who won an 'oscar', and who has starred blockbusters such as 'the ten commandments' among lots of others, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as this one, 'sartana', and such. regretable, indeed. one should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand. gone were the days when he was surrounded by steve mcqueen, james coburn, charles bronson, eli wallach, in 'the magnificent seven', and walked around under the famous elmer bernstein soundtrack. it's difficult to make a living out of being an actor, sometimes.

i could have done with the seven gunslingers just staying away. this sequel should never have been done, the first did it all and better. the plot was a turkey, the acting was turkey, the direction, production, camera work... all turkey. whoever put out this junk should be tarred and feathered. may they not return again!

b. kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifyinga gargantuan leftist western (not as leftist as the g. kennedy sequel, that came after this one).this is the ugliest film of the two sequelsvery ugly looking. it is slapdash. b. kennedy made it amplifyingbut without having the genius for that. hundreds of peons, hundreds of mexican _compadres, hundreds of women, a desert, barren landscapes, a stormthe largest scale.everything in this clumsy sequel, likable only in a weird way, is phony.the movie itself is very ugly looking. brynner, who made the best part in the first film, doesn't look good at all in this one.rey plays a priest; he will be a political leader, quintero, in the next sequel of the franchise. it is true that when you have that many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline; sometimes. e.g., brynner meets mcqueen; then they pick other 'compadres'; or, b. spencer meets coburn; etc.. it's fun to see where and how they'll meet the rest of the crew, etc.. but you need at least these several characters. unfortunately, burt kennedy's installment is not very good at that. return of the seven (1966) begins with a bullfighting. vin and chris meet there; they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original magnificentschico, who belongs to a huge group of 300 peons abducted by the mexican bandits. we find out the name of chico's appealing wifeit's petra. chris must constitute again a small armyand here we have a dirty dozen treatchris chooses his men from the convicts. another member of the commando is a womanizer, who will take good care of the wives left without husbands. the sexual humor is especially displeasing and distasteful in this film. it strives to seem smart and spicy; it is simply boorish and dumb and gross.the choosing of the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the mcqueen film. unfortunately, in the first sequel there is the most unmemorable of the three crews assembled under the magnificent seven's name.robert fuller makes a lousy "vin";oates is the smiley womanizer.in this mockgargantuan attempt, a mexican revolutionary leader has a gargantuan planhe kidnaps 300 peons and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons. (useless to say that this insane mexican revolutionist doesn't equal wallach's part in the first film.) b. kennedy bets exclusively on camp and overthetop stuff: ugly landscapes, a thunderstorm, gargantuan lightning ,a desert. a huge battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros. of course return of the seven (1966) completely abandoned the good sense of the mcqueen film.what is particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original filmyet, everything changed meantime in the way of making westerns.both the sequels look weird.

the original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of gun-toting saddle-tramps. still; their screen presence was at least underscored by a top-quality group of actors to support yul brynner. most were movie stars in their own right.however; this first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group now composed of largely b and c list players, who were more mediocre than magnificent. it was a similar set-up. brynner's 'chris' had to recruit yet another team of gun-toting saddle-tramps to sort out the mexican peasants' problems again. another tyrant was giving them grief.with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer. the budget was evidently very limited. this was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic. it was also more than half an hour shorter than john sturges' original. yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times. however, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up. filmiing was less expansive. it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.generally; it just lacked imagination. the first movie had been a smash-hit, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cash-in on former success. and it shows. there's very much a 'made for tv' feel about it.not recommended.

this movie had potential. the script was not bad, and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regrets, and--as chris says--"10 years of going nowhere". it's a sharp contrast to the original mag7 which was bright, humorous, and even the bad guy was lovable.it's a very interesting change of tone, and if they had developed the characters more, maybe i would've liked it.but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited together. at one point you see a horse fall, and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. but not many people would notice that, since there are already 2 dozen horse trips (i'm not exaggerating), and by then we've already dozed off.which leads me to the title of my review. this film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty, so chances are (if you decide to watch it) you'll get the watered down, kiddie version. there's a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull, and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering, there's no bull, just the matador in an empty arena. like wow, maybe the bull was a jedi, i dunno. more likely, the scene was cut.later there's a cockfight scene where, in the original version, one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering mexicans. this was cut. but we still see enough to get pretty annoyed.but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws. one after the other, you see horses' legs get yanked, sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head. in one scene, a horse gets thrown, and then while it's squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions, an explosive goes off right under its neck.this film was made in 1966 when hollywood was just starting to regulate animal brutality on film. this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen. so if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat, check it out & you'll get a mild thrill. but if not, you'll either be irritated or flat out bored.

"return of the seven" has a few good action scenes, and elmer bernstein's score is as rousing as ever. nevertheless, it's a boring film, because it simply fails to involve us emotionally. mcqueen's absence makes a really bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by a different (little-known) actor is odd - in a bad way. the characters are not developed, so we don't connect with them - and we hardly care when some of them die. this sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.

at one point in this waste of celluloid, charles dance as some sort of meant-to-be-funny, cyborg bad guy says "if i had an anus, i'd soil myself."quite.

you've got to be kidding. this movie sucked for the sci-fi fans. i would only recommend watching this only if you think armageddon was good.

okay,i realize that there are some doubting thomas's out there...i was one of them...but then i saw this masterpiece of celluloid.all i can say is that the scene in which george wendt gets sucked out of the spaceship by his a** left me trembling. i sometimes sit bolt upright in my bed, screaming like an old man on a proctologist's table thinking about it. if the director is reading this... i would pay to be an extra in the sequel.

i'd never heard of this film before i caught it on the telly last night. i do hope it was never given a cinema release as this would be an insult to the silver screen and movie-goers alike.was it supposed to be serious, was it supposed to be funny? why the outrageously basic plot? does anyone actually care?...awful film.2/10

oh dear! ohdear!ohdear!ohdear!i love science fiction but this... er... 'movie' just puts space flicks to shame. every sci fi film i've seen over the last year has been disappointing to some degree, and i'm now seriously reconsidering what genre of movies i actually like in future!! (maybe i'll watch romance flicks from now on!) spoilers alert! (and thats not saying much!)this flick is so insipidly dumb it rivals battlefield earth and baby geniuses in sheer badness. the special effects are obviously fake, the big mac truck looked stoopid with its roller coaster seat restraints, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the power rangers, a huge fat guy is sucked out of a port hole window butt first and... space truck school??? wtf?mr hopper can do better than this. what really stunk were the two good-looking young things who accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants (??) for an entire two thirds of the flick! the obligatory 'sex scene' (snicker!) between our young heroes was so poorly performed i nearly choked on my tonsils laughing at the tv screen.the only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain/cyborg/mad scientist. he oozed the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy, but i believe he could've been much more menacing. he does and says things which are quite funny (all the best scenes involve him!) so for the captain i give this movie an extra point.but this flick is so bad it'll make you want to hurl abuse at the tv or maybe throw your tv out the window! it may even kill off a few brain cells and put you into a catatonic state.conclusion? i like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his peg leg when its obviously a fake peg leg!! i would've given it 0 out of 10, but since he cracks me up with his stoopid antics... this flick gets 1/10!

dennis hopper must've been really hungry to do this movie. atrocious special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid-looking killer bio-robots. never mind the blatent disregard for science. the awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off. the best part of this movie was the pull-start cyber-penis on the wacked-out cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because i'm in a generous mood.

i must admit that this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i thought dennis hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of yeeeecchh. if this is supposed to be funny then i gotta look around for a new sense of humor. if you're thinking of buying this movie you'd better think again.

square pigs as a way of efficiently utilizing cargo space is the one and only clever moment in "space truckers". believe it or not, dennis hopper has done worse, see "the american way", but this movie is way up there on the "cream of the crap" scale. i think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that "space truckers" will please no one. too cartoon-like too be taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor, and poor character development, virtually assures disappointment. the beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing, but all others have been warned to avoid "space truckers" for all of the above reasons. - merk

cheaply-made, poorly acted, and unimaginatively directed, flight to mars still is entertaining despite what its has going against it. a flight to mars is planned with five people(three older gentleman, cameron mitchell as a newspaperman, and one female scientist/obvious love interest)"manning' the ship. the spaceship gets there and finds that very human-like martians live there and have technological advances that would make earth blush. but all is not rosy in the subterranean cities of the martians(here shown as some caves and a few rooms). the martians are a dying planet and one faction wants the earthlings to fix the ship only to take it away at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on earth and another faction wants to talk peace and see if they cannot persuade earth to give them living space. the special effects here are pretty lame even for 50's sci-fi standards complete with slow-moving rocket ship, pastel/neon alien garb where the women wear shorts that would make many blush(except the men of course), and little less offered. cameron mitchell is the journalist and is affable if nothing else. marguerite chapman is beautiful in very short shorts but adds little acting range. the rest of the cast is filled with some older sci-fi veterans like arthur franz and morris ankrum doing serviceable jobs. this isn't a premiere sci-fi film from the golden age by any standard, but it is very watchable and zips by at fast pace.

obviously influenced by the success of pal's "destination moon" and lippert's "rocketship x-m" this one just doesn't make the cut. limited special effects, a thin story line result in a production that even the half-decent cast can't save. just no believability here. no one seems surprised to encounter martians, much like earthlings, etc. etc. pass on it!

early 1950s sci-fi directed by lesley selander. special effects of course are very primitive, but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then. drive-in movie double feature fare; still interesting enough to watch. two leading men, arthur franz the brilliant young scientist dr. jim barker and straight talking and earthy newspaper reporter steve abbot(cameron mitchell)are joined on a manned flight to mars by carol stafford(virgina huston)another scientist and two other space experts(richard gaines and john litel). upon landing on the red planet, the space travelers encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced. in actuality, the martians are led by ikron(morris ankrum), who has the idea of conquering earth to vitalize their civilization. there is a beautiful martian(maruerite chapman)that dr. barker intends to take back on the return trip. she is the movie's redeemable element.

it is said that there are some people out there who actually admire monogram's movies. well -- and why not? monogram studios lived on a kind of cost plus basis; cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while. sure, they're cheap. but let's face it: they're coarse, fast, philistine, vulgar, but exhilarating. they have no pretensions at all. they're designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill. so what if john wayne gallops through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles? this isn't art, it's entertainment.take this movie, "flight to mars." at the beginning, when we're first meeting the characters, a man might introduce his female companion abruptly, avoiding any tedious subtlety: "professor, this is my fiancée and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. she loves me but is growing impatient with me because i'm always wrapped up in my scientific work. perhaps you could steal her from me, marry her, give her the babies and the picket-fenced home she yearns for. if necessary i will die on this journey to see her dreams realized. also, she likes it a little rough." it saves a lot of writing and shooting time, doesn't it? that's what people mean when they say a narrative is "fast". (this one was shot in five days.) why should we have to hint about these things? i mean, what the hell is this, a cheap sci fi movie or henry james? actually this is a particularly well-funded example of a monogram movie. it's in color, for one thing. "cinecolor" to be exact. (you can tell it's not any other "color" you'd recognize.) and look at the cast. the female lead is dismissible, as is usual with monogram, but the male leads are definitely up there on the b list. cameron mitchell as the reporter, yet to hit his stride as a male lead, which, come to think of it, he never really did. and arthur franz as the pipe-smoking head scientist, the pride of perth amboy, new jersey. and -- for science fiction fans -- how about this pair of aces: both morris ankrum and john litel! there's not really much point in describing the plot in detail. the five crew members crash land on mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts. and they picked up english from listening to our broadcasts. american broadcasts, that is, judging from their speech. they're led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship, build many imitations of it, and colonize earth. they do not succeed.the special effects aren't very special. the men walk around a couple of spare sets, wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them. their names consist exclusively of english phonemes -- alzar, terris, ikron. the lissome martian who falls for arthur franz is named alita, with an indo-european diminutive appendage, and she already knows what kissing is.overall, i found it as snappy as it was intended to be, but dull too. the story is that of any buck rogers 1930s serial. once the earthlings and the martians meet and it's established that they have a common language, and that the martians have a sinister agenda, that's it. in two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of nazi spies in world war ii. the plot is done by the numbers, the dialog has no sparkle, the acting is pedestrian.however, dedicated aficionados of monogram productions should enjoy it. after all, jean-luc goddard, the contrarian french egghead, dedicated "a bout de soufflé" to monogram, so they can't have been all that bad.

'you're in the navy now' is painfully bad: very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made. it's supposedly based on a true story, but the incident which inspired this film doesn't seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature-length script.i saw this movie on local television while i was house-sitting for my mother-in-law in long island, new york. there was a raging blizzard outside, and i was literally snowbound. if i'd been able to get out the door, i definitely would have stopped watching this movie.there are some interesting names in the supporting cast, notably charles bronson (under his original name), lee marvin, harvey lembeck, jack webb and jack warden. forget it. everybody stinks in this movie. even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful. lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly, there's no point in your watching for them.gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new, experimental steam turbine: basically, the whole ship is a giant teakettle. cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one: if it were, it would have gone to a better officer.cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply had no ability for comedy. he made several bad comedies, and this one is his worst. jane greer has always bored me, and she bored me more than usual here. this ship went down with all hands, and sank without a trace. have i mentioned that this movie stinks? i'll rate 'you're in the navy now' one point out of 10. toot! toot!

i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight & valentino with elizabeth perkins, gwyneth platrow, whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner. there are a lot of similarities between the two films. they both have great casts and good acting. they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different, an offensive stepmother, a woman friend/confidant, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother and a surprise lover. both films have the characters experience life-changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of 'love conquers all' sentimentality. they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow naked.both films seem contrived, as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said, "ok, there's a market for stories about relationships between women, so i'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother" in other words, instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation. it seems forced, the characters don't seem real, the relationships are unbelievable.the resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after. it's just not real. romantic fantasy.the characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than moonlight & valentino, especially the stepmother part. sydelle feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her, or even marry her in the first place.if you liked moonlight & valentino you will probably like in her shoes as well. enjoyable performances in both, in fact, the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts.

poor shirley maclaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she's trampled by the run-away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality.this was directed by curtis hanson? did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him? hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy, as evidenced by "wonder boys." so i don't know what happened to him here. this is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and fussy, and that neat, tidy endings (however implausible they might be) might make for a nice closing shot, but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through.my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred -- e.g. "the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead." bingo! this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems, making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them. toni collette (a fine actress, by the way, and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here), gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, spelling out in flashing neon the film's awkward connecting motif. at that moment, i knew what i was in for, and the film was a downward spiral from there.grade: c-

this was supposed to be set in the "bible belt" of northern ireland. well, as someone who grew up there,and was a child in the era depicted in the film it just didn't ring true! the accents were all over the place - anything but county antrim/derry. the church didn't resemble any i have ever seen. "the church of god" is a pentecostal denomination but the one in the film was certainly not pentecostal! the elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the church of ireland (anglican)- and no c.of i. would call itself "the church of god". the minister was often addressed as "reverend" - they may do that in some parts of the world but i never heard it when i lived in that area. ministers were addressed as "mr ......"this film was very badly researched and cast - fairly typical of irish cinema - annoying! a film can have a great plot, but if it doesn't look authentic, it is rubbish.

for a country that has produced some of the world's finest dramatists and has such a rich musical heritage it has always been a source of bewilderment to me why so much of ireland's home-grown cinema has been so appalling. perhaps because, by its very nature, those talented in the field of irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in britain or america, (colin farrell is a recent case in point), and that the really successful irish directors that have continued to work in ireland and with irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. i am thinking particularly of jim sheridan and neil jordan who alternate between films with an irish setting and projects filmed abroad."middletown", however, is very much an irish film even if two of its principal actors are english. it's certainly well-made of its kind and might have bucked the trend that irish films aren't really very good; (paddy breathnach's "i went down", written by the brilliant young playwright conor mcpherson, is a crucial exception). unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious irish town, presumably in the north of ireland judging by the accents, (mid-ulster bible-belt, if you ask me), and presumably in the recent past, (the fifties? the sixties?), is so over-the-top that it really is quite ridiculous.nothing in the film rings true and you can't help feeling it's writer, daragh carville, has been strongly influenced by flannery o'connor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the american bible-belt and not in ireland where even the most extreme protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this. it's all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is, though i was more prone to giggles than frisson's at the right reverand matthew macfayden's antics. he has the ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of daniel mays as his brother, gerard mcsorley as his father or eva birthistle as mays' wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film. so rather than a step up the ladder for irish cinema "middletown" is, i'm afraid, just another nail in its coffin.

the film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove, through the drizzly street and the run-down garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film. it also has a wonderful sense of time, both 1950's (the film's opening) and 1960's. all of the performances are top-class, especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard mcsorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son. what a pity, then, that the story is so ridiculous. for a start, in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel (mcfadyen) and his family, it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community. in the church, we see five or six of the main characters at the front, and another two or three at the back, but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins: they show no sign of hearing him, heeding him or dissenting from him; at the cockfight, nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings, but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him; a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains. secondly, middletown (which isn't actually a town, but a tiny village) seems to lack some essential services, such as police and fire service: murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar; residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema. for that matter, everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent, the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat-fields, and most puzzling of all for a 'typical' north of ireland setting, there is only one christian community - not even a couple of anglicans to season the mix. even if you're willing to suspend disbelief, the story itself is pretty threadbare, a pale imitation of an a.j. cronin melodrama. and the music? well, it's beautiful for the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated non-stop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating. my advice: watch this with the sound off.

once again, the posters lied to me.the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? when i read the synopsis for this movie, i was expecting to see a townful of grotesques, every man-jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol, peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a "den of vice" would come the clean-shaven hero, shining gabriel. instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect.the first few minutes of the film showed us that middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can, whether fiddling a little to make ends meet, drinking to forget the pain, or watching cock-fighting (chickens, not penises) to while away the boredom. in other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary.the only (deliberate?) grotesque in the piece was gabriel, the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen, whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. if i were kind, i would suggest that the paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith. unfortunately, brian kirk is so inept a film-maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty-plus minutes of dark, hackneyed tedium. my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of "guess the accent" broken up with rounds of "spot the location." are we surprised that gaybo ends up stealing his brother's child and suffocating his father? of course not; he's a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie, but i suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to.the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise. the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace "superman returns" as the worst film of 2006; one hell of an achievement.v1:20061114 v2:20080107

i have a lot of respect for mr. argento's work, but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films really unique. the opening to the film is great, and sets you up for the possibility of a really scary horror film. what occurs for the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build into much. there are some good performances, though, and a lot of great atmosphere. the end of the film is weak considering everything this builds up to. where there should be some grand climax of huge proportions you instead get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies use, making it feel like they just needed to wrap it up. a couple of scenes are very memorable for their imagery, but in the end the film does not gel to make a really good movie. unless you feel you must see everything this director made i suggest passing on this one...

in the same way lamberto bava was a substandard facsimilie of his father, mario (who was an extremely overrated director anyway), michele soavi is a substandard director in the dario argento mold. "the church" has at least one thing to recommend it--the incredibly detailed art direction--but absolutely nothing else. the film is long-winded, filled with one-dimensional characters, and almost put me to sleep several times. there's a fine line between 'art' and 'pretentious crap,' and while "the church" isn't completely worthless, you'd be better off watching something else.3/10

i had always eyed italian horror maestro dario argento's efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of lamberto bava's terrible demons (1985); the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we're in full halloween swing. i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature  the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but, then, the film proper (which makes no more sense than what's presented in that frenzied two-minute montage and, in retrospect, can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights) proved a definite let-down!opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander nevsky (1938), it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative. consequently, several characters randomly take center-stage throughout  with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on, the sinister-looking bishop (feodor chaliapin) resulting a mere red herring, the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities, the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goat-shaped demon (culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted all-too-obviously from rosemary's baby [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year old asia argento as the rebellious but likable sacristan's daughter (who emerges as the only survivor by the end). incidentally, the older argento also co-wrote the film's story and screenplay along with director soavi and (under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with dario in the early stages of production) original helmer lamberto bava and prolific genre scribe dardano sacchetti (whom i met at the 61st venice film festival in 2004).the extremely muddled second half of the film, then, sees a group of people  including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering english couple (whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline)  similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits (the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult)not that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of luis bunuel's sublimely surreal the exterminating angel (1962) you see! in the end, the film is all the more disappointing (though sergio stivaletti's gruesome effects, at least, are notable) given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other soavi title i'd watched  cemetery man (1994), which i own via the r2 se dvd. that said, i'd still like to catch his debut feature  stage fright (1987)  and the director's follow-up effort to the church, entitled the sect (1991)...

let me get this straight... "the church" has a safety "lock-down" mechanism to keep the spirits from leaving but the ultimate solution is bringing it to the ground?! lofl! maybe i'm missing the plot. maybe this guy is from the ed wood school of film-making or something. this movie is about as useless as the church itself. hey... maybe that's the point. that whole rosemary's baby-esq segment was hilarity. i can go to my corner halloween costume shop and get better drag than that. the entire film needs to be remade. properly. there were so many things that were played down... so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling. i'm not sure if the fault lies with the writing or editing but what i saw should not have this high of a rating.

master of italian horror dario argento is called a lot of bad things by non-fans. and is deserving of absolutely none of the backlash. in fact, every time i hear something bad about argento- i think they're really talking about michele soavi. he just doesn't get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters. in fact, his best film - 1994's cemetery man - was probably his least successful. or just didn't get the attention he felt it deserved, because after that, he left film and went into directing television. he's never gone back. so people really don't know how inferior his other films are because by the time they've seen them, they're already fans of the italian horror aesthetic. which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films. this is where the church stands out from the pack. because visually, it's so cheap and ancient-looking, you can smell the dust. but it has its' charms too, though they are few. the camera-work is truly arresting and the music score is hugely elaborate and grand.since argento is the reasons people have seen soavi's work all, i don't know anyone who caught the church before argento's suspiria and deep red. soavi is a bit of a hack. sort of like an italian mick garris- the utmost example of a director preferring style over substance. the flaws of the church are constant and plenty. the film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant village akin to those you see in any robin hood adaptation, in some long-ago century. these scenes are intense enough, energetic, and get quickly to the point. then, we cut to the present, where the film's style takes over. yeah, the movie is okay to look at. and for about 35 or so minutes in the present, 1980's wherever-italy, the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements. so now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of it's horror. and it's a decent build up, for the most part. but as the movie approaches the halfway point, we realize the movie's driving by, and... nothing is happening.the plot is very simple. i think. two people working in a church, one as a cataloger of books and the other as a restorer of the building's wall artwork, discover a scroll / scripture that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich off of. so he follows his 'map' only to uncover a force underneath the church that has him hallucinate, while he's slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else hallucinate. so while he is doing his demon-work, someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon 'contagen' spreads onto everyone, leaving a black preacher and the little girl who sneaks out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls. that probably sounds action-packed and soavi's style is far more lethargic than argento. but never before have i seen an attempted surrealist film this agonizingly boring. i kid you not. absolutely nothing happens in the entire film! i've seen expressionistic (or impressionistic, i'm no film school super-grad) films before, but most of them actually show things happening (john carpenter's halloween for one).it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of lamberto bava's demons films (since argento co-produced). we're shown to a location where a bunch of people gather, one turns into a demon, all the others are isolated, that person infects everyone except a couple survivors, then the demons either get out- infecting the world, or the survivors get out when the demons die. this film puts all those same elements in place. except, unlike argento's work, nothing happens. okay, a few things do happen. but only one bizarre sequence has the panache of lamberto's much more fun demons films. a random woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor. what's bizarre about that, you wonder? it happens in front of about two dozen people. what do they do? nothing. she dies, her head trickles blood in closeup. but all those people don't even notice, though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them. maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her, so they duck out of the way. she's killed and in the shot after she dies, everyone is just sitting around, being quiet while a boy plays a saxophone. i kid you not. that's what happens. that's more than logically incoherent- it's plain stupid.the scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death. they all just up and forget about it. and this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie. i'm not saying it's the only violence, gore, or murder we see. it's not. it's just the only thing we can tell is happening. for example, in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly. she starts clawing the skin on her face off, but when she reappears minutes later- no scratches. people are devoured by fish and their faces are squashed by subway cars. but later they turn up as totally unharmed members of a possessed cult, in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy- copying a famous scene from roman polanski's 1968 masterpiece, rosemary's baby, the greatest horror film ever made, shot for shot. even if argento did that, i would be furious!

i was initially interested in this film after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking screenshots, and the promise was there for a gripping horror film of the dario argento style. admittedly i must say that argento's films have occasionally been rather incoherent, and some feel like a handful of visually impacting set pieces loosely strung together with a vague connecting plot.since argento is credited as writer for this, i have to say, i'm not really surprised. even his masterpiece suspiria, when examined, exhibits the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for the aesthetic impact. however, suspiria also had the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that contributed ultimately to the eventual resolution.the church, on the other hand, has none of these things. it has no main character, no protagonist whatsoever; it furthermore has no real plot to speak of, and no crescendo, no climax, no denouement, and no resolution. it is a completely hollow, incoherent work that views as if argento sat down and thought 'hey, that would make an interesting scene visually...let's do it!' the film is a series of these scenes.initially it might be interesting, and soavi's direction is excellent, i must say. soavi cannot be faulted for the material, as it is made as compelling as possible. however, such good direction calls attention to the horrible failings of the script, and there is absolutely no sense in it. the attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing more than plagiarism of carpenter's film prince of darkness. events happen solely because the script wishes them to, and reactions to those events are completely implausible. the narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point, simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief; it's too ludicrous. added to this are numerous factual errors that are so glaringly showcased that it becomes embarrassing.if it had been more overtly artistic and edited down into a different work, it might have been chilling or tense. if it had been fleshed-out into an actual cohesive narrative, it might have been gripping. but it was none of these. the best it managed was confusing and, at times, infuriating. plots are introduced but never followed. characters are forgotten about and altered arbitrarily. no logic is ever applied to any situation. it might have been scary or interesting, but to elicit that sort of feeling takes more effort on the part of a screenwriter...much more.all in all, the church is not worth viewing for anyone but total enthusiasts of italian horror that is more style than substance. this is argento's style at its worst, and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism.

i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film. but even by those low standards this film doesn't cut it. the problem isn't so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting, writing, directing, sound, music and editing. i expected all of that to be bad, and it is.the biggest problem with this film is that it didn't even do a good job on the guts and gore. most of the 'action' takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects, which look very fake -- even by the standards of low budget gore films. there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done. peter jackson made the equally low budget 'bad taste' at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this film.a failure on just about every level, i can't recommend this film to anybody. steer clear of it. 

is this supposed to be serious? i hope not. this is one of the most pathetically hilarious movies i've ever seen. given that i picked it up for a buck on the "bad movies" shelf, it sure lives up to its spot in the shop. what can i say, the gore effects are spattered (pun-intended) all over the place, some looking quite real, some looking like a teddy bear that's had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. the music is some of the most horrible i've heard, the acting is one of the most amusing elements... must i continue? don't bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop and this is all that's left.

emotionally insecure tom russo (asbestos felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife leeza (courtney lercara) and is dismayed to discover that the love of his life has apparently been sleeping with every bloke she meets; this shocking revelation sends poor tom off his rocker, and he proceeds to wreak bloody revenge on the men who he believes have been rogering his old lady.in my experience, really, really bad films can often be as much fun as really good ones, and no film featuring a decapitation by machete-enhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely worthless; but even though killing spree very occasionally manages to entertain with its inventiveness and cheap and cheerful gore, i found that the terrible direction, awful production values, ugly cinematography, muffled sound, dreadful lighting, mind numbingly tedious and daft narrative (which includes a really dumb plot twist that is telegraphed from the beginning, plus a pointless zombie finale), nasty synthesizer score, inane dialogue, and thoroughly amateurish acting all served to make this effort from writer/director tom ritter a virtually joyless experience.

i know that many people will/have automatically given this film a rating of 1, just because it doesn't have the huge budget and top-of-the-line special effects that they are used to. i, however, knew what i was getting myself into when i popped this into the vcr.i don't think we get much more low-budget that this, unless we are filming a family reunion. the lighting is awful, sound quality is at times incomprehensible, and the acting is ultra-bad by almost all involved. but, this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough. it centers around a fellow named tom russo (asbestos felt), who has been down on his luck with his job. he is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on himself. as he begins working more hours, we see him slowly transcend into madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men (most repair guys) that he feels are responsible. i must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap, but fit with the overall tone of the film.. the brutal ways that tom russo comes up with to murder these men gives us an idea of just has mad he has become. the pacing of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. the ending really doesn't follow the rest of the plot of the film, as it seems to want to go from a psycho-slasher film, to a "dawn of the dead" wannabe, but it is entertaining nonetheless and i must give tim ritter credit for wanting to use an unconventional ending. i can honestly say that i enjoyed this film, but it is by no means a good film, if that makes sense. it's budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to overlook. i do not recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the big-budget movies and who can't have an open-mind to ultra-low budget films. you simply won't enjoy it. for others, and fans of gore--i say give it a shot. you will find at least something redeeming in it! my grade: d

ordinarily, i love these "stranger within" thrillers. some good examples are "fatal attraction," "single white female," and "audition." done well, they can be a lot of fun, and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares. of course, the opposite can be true: done poorly, they can be tedious and stupid. "the hand that rocks the cradle" is one of the latter.the bartels, claire (annabella sciorra) and michael (matt mccoy) are welcoming another member to their family. but busy claire is persuaded by michael to hire a nanny. one day, a woman named peyton flanders (rebecca demornay) shows up, and because she seems perfect, the bartels hire her. of course, once she shows up, their idyllic life is slowly unraveling...this film suffers from a plethora of problems, but the biggest one is the handling of the villain. peyton is never believable. part of this has to do with how she's written, and how she's acted. the things that she does that are supposed to put us on edge are so contrived that they're laughable. de mornay doesn't help much. she portrays peyton as two different people. while it's true she's supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, de mornay's performance creates a divide between the two facets of her character.the other actors are good, however. annabella sciorrra is terrific as the asthmatic claire. sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately, the script lets her down. matt mccoy is almost invisible. however, julianne moore is delightful as claire's friend marlene. moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately she's only on screen for a total of five minutes.curtis hanson is a good director, but you wouldn't know it from watching this dud. the film has a few decent shocks, but it's poorly paced, and the climax, while generating some tension, is actually kind of laughable. that being said, he's working with a script that at best, could charitably be called pathetic.trust me, when it comes to nannies, stick with fran drescher. this one should have gone to the direct-to-video bin.

piece of junk, would've given it a 0 if i could have. animation is good, but not quite good enough. storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous i've ever come across, and that's saying a lot! this 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting, but failed miserably. it's almost as if the writer started one story, then got another idea, and attempted to mesh the two together. don't waste your time on this; believe me, you'll be as ticked off with yourself as i was. the only actor of any note in this was james woods, and his part was peripheral at best. i'm all for doing stuff that is edgy, that pushes the envelopes, but this simply didn't cut it.

predictable unmotivated pointless caricatures contrived actors did what they could actors clearly indicated they were embarrassed to do this not one emotional connection real sequence from film "who you callin?" (sic) "the police"(sic) "you can't do that, stevie. hang up the phone"(sic) "jesse got a sh-t load o' drug money, you can't go involving the cops"(sic) "i'm not so sure stealing money from criminals is a crime. even if they arrest him at least he'll be alive"(sic) "listen to me, stevie, this ain't handled right, jesse's gonna end up dead. now hang up that f-in phone." (sic) best friend starts to load up guns brother, "hey, what're you doin'?" no answer. "hey, i got a family to worry about." (keep in mind his child is sitting right there watching-ish all of this) then more and more and more expositionnotice how in the above sequence, at no time do the police on the other line say, "hello? hello? uh, we can hear everything you're saying. we're sending someone over there right now." embarrassment for all. oops.

this film is bundled along with "gli fumavano le colt... lo chiamavano camposanto" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints. first, both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though "il prezzo del potere" does seem to have a better dub. personally, i always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. these dvd problems, however, are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.as for the film, it's about the assassination of president garfield. this is a major problem, as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland. in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield. he's missing the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this, i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes. plus, using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho!! he was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.in addition to the stupid casting, president garfield's death was in no way like this film. it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk, not garfield. garfield was shot in washington, dc (not dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. however, according to most experts, what actually killed garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. in other words, like george washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed president garfield was shot.because the film bears almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. why not also include ninjas, fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it?!?! aside from some decent acting and production values, because the script is utter cow crap, i don't recommend anyone watch it. it's just a complete and utter mess.

i think this movie had really bad production value. the lack of acting makes me think they should mark it as an early docudrama. it may have had no money available for its making. i feel bad that it was a ruff ride into the major league for jackie robinson.i believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day. he had to be really great to break the color barrier of the time. no getting around that this was a really bad movie.wish there was more info about its makers. they may have been limited by the quality of actors that were willing to take on the project. maybe no money to get good people.

me being one was probably having a brain fart at the time for renting it. anyone who actually buys it, will enjoy using this as a coaster. perhaps a frisbee? this is a dvd i actually found up front where the kids could get to it. since dvd's don't seem to be in the position to be put in that tell tale back room with all the big box vhs tapes are, i find it rather annoying they stuck this up next to a disney film. yep, going from dinosaur to erotic ghost has shown what we all think of disney right? i havent' stooped that low just yet. there's no acting in here. the only thing interesting is the old 1973 movie trailers for ollllld ancient erotic films that i'm amazed have escape from being burned to hell.1/10 (if imdb allowed zero's it'd be 0/10)

at last. here's a movie that does as much for the reputations of the men of greece and russia as "gigli" did for the those of mr. affleck and ms. lo. from the edge of the city details the sad and sordid lives of some young russian émigrés who live in and around athens and spend their time burglarizing cars, getting laid, pimping woman émigrés and prostituting themselves ("but we're not gay because we don't do, you know.... and if we do, it's only once or twice. with the same guy.") there is hardly anything here you have not seen before and better; only the athens locale adds a little novelty--even then there's but a scene or two that's scenic. writer/director constantine giannaris ("3 steps to heaven") offer a relatively generic 95 minutes, in which the standout moments involve how stupid, sexist and (from the looks of things) pretty much irredeemable most of these guys are. (interestingly, the gayer the guy, the more redeemable he appears.) what really rankles is the treatment of the women. greek and russian males would seem to give the italians a run for their money regarding that famous madonna/whore complex. has life in greece improved much for women since the time of plato and socrates? one has to wonder.if i seem to be equating russians and greeks in this review, i apologize, but even the non-émigrés pictured here (the cab driver, for instance) are creeps. according to another review on this site, the film (a hit on its home turf) was actually submitted by greece for an academy award for best foreign film. what this says about the state of greek movie-making, i hesitate to ponder.

let me tell you a story.one day on the streets of athens a film director bumped into a male prostitute and decided that the world just had to know his story because...you know... he's deprived...and he takes his shirt off a lot and...so on.this film is the result of his revelation. repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist...but of course filled with pretty guys with their chests showing. if this is your idea of a good film then enjoy, if not avoid it like the plague.it's put me off ever going to greece that's for sure.

it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the 90s and which places an explicit sell-by date on the visual style. characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan. street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains. they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser. all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals. when things go wrong its all because they aren't real greeks - they're pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world. makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russian/kazakh/albanian cultures. if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production. the fleeting glimpses of toned boy-beef is the only spark in this generic small-time mobster programmer.

when you're used to lana turner in the postman always rings twice, and compare it to this low budget, low talent, low quality film, well, i was just embarrassed for ida lupino's 'singing' (more like talking) and non-piano playing scenes. when the first non-singing scene started and all the people just stared flatly at her, i was positive they were all going to roll their eyes and start leaving or at least talking among themselves (she stinks, c'mon let's get out of here). the actors are flat - emotions are deflated. and ida is a real spoiled bi-otch throughout - just a 100% turnoff. this was like betty boop on conscious sedation meets a gas station attendant in nowhere's ville usa. the story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, her chest was... no never mind. i felt sad for the rest of the actors. perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role, and the men actors had more emotion, then the film could have had a chance. sorry for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world. i wouldn't have minded if it stayed out of this world.

20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. miscast is ida lupino in the leading role! lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room torch singer. handsome cornel wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented celeste holm who's role is little more than a bit part. then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! when we first see him he is a nice o.k. guy who runs a thriving road house. then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - he becomes insanely jealous of his manager (wilde) when the latter tells him that he is about to marry lupino. you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but - 1) he never proposed to her - 2) they never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - 3)without telling anyone (including lupino) he has obtained a marriage license. wow! so how widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with lupino after such a "courtship" is anybody's quess. huh? well, when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say. from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical! his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. he finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy udo sniggers, he laughably goes gunning for poor cornel wilde before biting the dust himself.and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. there's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! added to this - 95% of the film takes place at night.besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette "widmark & lupino at fox". whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else! however this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as robert osborne, eddie muller, rudy belhmer and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. all i can say then it must be me i guess. but "road house" up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained so.fox would do better if they issued dvds of superior and thus far elusive widmark movies like "down to the sea in ships" (1949) and the colourful "red skies of montana" (1952).

this movie was just so utterly horrible that i couldn't get through the entire thing without turning it off, it was just that bad! when i was watching it i kept thinking it looked like some really cheap film made back in the 60's or something with those terrible looking special effects, but then i realized that this was just made in 2001. the dialog and the acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost non-existent. i didn't think anyone would go back to making films that look so cheap and old, i'm not sure if they did that on purpose or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie at all. it really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at a local person's house or something. maybe they thought they were being retro or something but it just comes off looking really cheesy.i really don't know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this.0 out of 5 *'s.

this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seen.however, that is not all that this movie is lacking. this movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, you name it--it's the worst ever.i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbage.i do agree with an earlier post that the "women" were definitely men dressed up in drag, and that did give me a laugh, i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy women.anyway, there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching!to sum it up: horrible acting, horrible script, horrible idea for a movie. an hour and a half of my life i want back right now!!

when i first saw this i thought it was a joke. all i could think was "you get the 8mm camera, i'll get my little brother's monster toys, we'll make a movie!" why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a sci-fi movie like this, it looks like it was made in the early 80's. with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian, a script that was written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop, poverty-row special effects, and to top it off, a director that thought making this crap would make them famous. the end result wasn't spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity. from venus must have been fun to make and i'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie.a 2 out of 10 for a valiant, hopeless effort.

in spite of its high-minded ambitions, zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. it's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist (which i think is what zurlini was attempting). it's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic. despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience in. too much is unintentionally funny (the phony sound of dripping water in drago's quarters, for example, or the silent-movie mugging by some of the actors) or simply confusing (why exactly does drago want to leave the fort the first time?) for the film to succeed as a coherent work.

skip all the subjective "this is a great film" reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox (which includes both versions of this flick) which i'll paraphrase: "to the tune of sci-fi score by george antheil, the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b-movie hell, all photographed by will thompson (who did 'plan 9 from outer space' & 'maniac')." you don't know whether to laugh at the film or with it. so if you like self-produced b or c-grade noir-wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism, this could be for you! otherwise, get a copy of "screamplay", a modern low-budget expressionist masterpiece.

the movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane. to show that she is mentally ill, she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she's "going mad". along the way, she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be orson welles' brother and he later takes a header off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie.this is a strange little film that is very cheaply made--and it sure shows. the film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or some other cheap type of film) and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later. in fact, the narration was the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious i have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over-the-top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it. as a result of these cost-cutting actions, it's not surprising that the film is bad, though the idea of trying to make this sort of film was pretty original. plus, it's very hard to make it through the entire film.

my friends and i have just finished seeing a preview of this new australian film. everyone who was in the cinema agreed, what was the point of this film? there was no good story to follow, the characters were undeveloped, and the plot seemed unmotivated. i find it bizarre that this film, that probably cost in the high millions, got funded and made. it serves no purpose to the drama community, its adds nothing to the palette of australian cinema. it really was a waste of time creating this droll unemotional piece of work and more time really should be spent work-shopping scripts and creating good stories, not creating a mess like this. hugo weaving and rose byrne were ok but severely hampered by a bad script. pia miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were average at best. a true waste of talent. the saving grace was geoffrey simpson acs' cinematography, which like most aussie films, was superb. come on guys, think about it next time please.4/10

recension: angels & demonsthe movie is directed by ron howard. he has had also made famous movies like the da vinci code & cinderella men. he directed also the famous tv-series 24. the most famous actors are tom hanks(the da vinci code,the green mile, forrest gump,) & ewan mcgregor(cassandra's dream, moulin rouge, star wars: the phantom menace,).in the begin i was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. because they changed the father of vittoria vettra(ayelet zurer) in someone else, silvano bentivoglio(camren argenziano). another change is that robert langdon(tom hanks) never goes to the cern. it was nice that they could film on location in the cern.then movie goes on, they are spectacular car races in rome. an i also like the part in chirstian archives very much when they destroy the work of galileo, it was funny. it was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, robert langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get oni found it very stupid that robert langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the camerlengo(ewan mcgregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. in the book he is the real son of the pope.when i should give the best acting performance then i should say pierfrancesco favino who plays inspector olivetti. the worst acting was from the assassin, who was played by nikolaj lie kaas, i think he was underachieving, because in adams apples he played faboulous.i think the whole movie is underachieving because director ron howard made some many stupid changes. i would rate the movie by 4/10.

thankfully i watched this film alone, enabling me to fast-forward through the worst scenes (aka most of the film, actually). ok, some of it is not all bad, with partially good photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times not too bad directing. but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. additionally, when i don't find the movies "hottie" to be all that, even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes get dull. really dull! and for the drama: you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies.if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie. if not, stay well clear!

what the heck is this about? kelly (jennifer) seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island. she finds this juan p (manuel) existing and exotic, though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face, which he also justify later on in the movie, right or wrong? these two guys are the first to find each other on the island. kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house. mr handyman. they seem to have a great time. then billy zane (jack, kellys characters husband) shows up and of course, two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous juan p, he is a little bit jealous. billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world. he dislikes juan p (for hitting his girlfriend at the pier, who can blame him? hes also is arrogant, but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the waiter/everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min. wouldn't you be upset? yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him. but at the same time, he is, not to be blamed for, suspicious about the scuba goggles manuel has. kelly and billy just lost some dear friends! how convenient he just happens to have them, no matter what!). however, for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting manuel and starts to hate billy for being jealous. ok, billy is overreacting, thats for sure, but kelly isn't doing much to convince him either. she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice (and even though manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions. but kelly is so forgiving...). yeah right. and then she starts to have sex with this juan p. it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident, at least, they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other. now, you can think that this scenario is possible. but for real, is it? are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar? (i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case). for christ sake, juan p hasn't really shown himself being a good person. catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties, is that showing a good side? not trying to befriend kellys husband in anyway (which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island-time, simply be respect) he doesn't care about their relationship (and kelly cant figure that one out), he just want to have sex with kelly. kellys character is just not trustworthy (if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl, wouldn't she be upset or what?!). or maybe she is? billy zane plays a not very nice person, and juan p isn't actually much better if you really think about it. and poor kelly is so confused, and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p? so... for all of you who reads this... what do you think about it? if you where the kelly character, would you consider cheating on your husband, knowing one day you'll be back in real life, and all of a sudden billys maybe not that horrible person after all. hes just too jealous. and if you where billys character, what do you say, is he totally wrong in his behavior? and juan p character what do you guys really think of him. one thing is for sure. manuels exist! ps... the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here! what the heck was that about?! seriously! anyone tell me?

it is playing on showtime right now but is going to be released as a movie called three or has been released for 2006. mess ups include a supposed nude body comes out of the waves with her bottoms on. you can have fun finding the others. it was a decent stranded, hungry, cold, crazy person video but that is about it. and of course what would a movie be without sex. the lady has a nice body and the men are pretty, but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood. wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now gonna release it as three. billy zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely. juan di pace is awesome and there is a couple good sex scenes. there is a voodoo woman that loves the character di pace plays and in real life her name is di pace too. not aware of any connection but probably kin or married.

if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the "villain" not be more sympathetic than the "victim". and this fails miserably. it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment. ok, so the husband is rich and cocky. there are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife display plenty. the husband is a jerk because he - um, didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw. the cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife. he then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him. uh huh. the misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting. it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims. what was he thinking???

did anyone notice?when miss brook went skinny dipping,she left the water wearing white bikini bottoms and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy.this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please.how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a fm photo shoot.what started out with premise turned in to soft porn.and billy zane come on,you cant be that hard up for film offers.check out dead calm.also when the people took her away ,how come she scoffed her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up.i suggest billy find decent scripts,kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel.

yes, bad acting isn't only one thing to mention. bad script,not so bad music. unfortunately.nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too.first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea, to have some fun !!! smiling ...they find everything in the sea. i mean things like fishing-net, knife, scuba dive things, ropes, bottles, husband ...woodoo stuff , are you kidding. stupid. they are so happy on the island, they are going to die, and they are happy. love, peace. love. just stupid.terrible, skip this one please.

i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company...attended the uk premiere last night. zane and brook attended (they probably knew i was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a film. i felt sorry for them at times, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes.but perhaps i was missing the point. perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. if so, pure genius. if not, career genocide.on the plus side, zane always shines, and brook can actually act a little. as the other half said (as we ran out the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! the scriptwriter, however, should be marooned.

a holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning.i like boobs. no question about that. but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. take two guys (a husband and another man), put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them, ad a deserted island, subtract all her moral issues, ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. the acting is, i would say, good. there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. the main female character makes me sick. this is due to her lack of moral values. the man with the most fish get's her attention. even though one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with being unfaithful with (manuel) the other man because "i must do it to survive". how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? and he won't even benefit from it? the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. if she doesen't get approval for her actions, she's a victim.i recommend everyone to see this movie. this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience.

i'm a historian. this movie is so wrong it hurts. tried to watch with an open mind, but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history, locations, church protocol, et cetera. stop playing to the dumb audience, please. there are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. a little research, all i'm asking. but then again, the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. so basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. i know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.

unspeakable starts in los angeles with jim (roger cline) & his wife alice fhelleps (tamera noll) arguing as they drive along in the pouring rain, unfortunately jim crashes the car & his daughter heather (leigh silver) ends up dead while alice is turned into a wheelchair bound vegetable. devastated by the death of his daughter jim starts visiting prostitutes, he then kills them because of voices in his head. erm, that's it really.written, produced & directed by chad ferrin i hate unspeakable as a film. there are some films you occasionally see that move the 'goal posts' as it were in regard to everything you watch thereafter, some films are so brilliant that all other's will be judged by it while other's like unspeakable for example are so bad that it sets a new cinematic low. this is truly one of the worst films i've ever seen & i am seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the imdb although i'm not surprised the the low overall rating on the main page, i not sure if i missed something but for a start unspeakable has no plot, it has no story & a lot of it seems almost random. there was nothing in unspeakable to maintain my interest or entertain & as a result became a test of endurance to get through to the end. the film tries to be shocking with some limp scenes of sexual abuse of a rent boy by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person craps herself, it splats on the floor & her dodgy male nurse starts feeling her soiled genitals, legs & underwear. if anyone can find such crap entertaining then i'll just cut my wrists now, the character's are some of the worst i've had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounding like it came straight from some dirty faggot porno of the worst kind. it doesn't work as a horror as it's not scary in the slightest, it's absolutely hilarious & frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a great loss & attempting to cope with it & overall i just think it's a pointless, rubbishy, badly made piece of crap from troma.director ferrin films like some badly made documentary, the special effects are terrible & are of the 'let's pour tomato ketchup on our actor's face & the audience will be convinced that they died a gory death' variety, there is no graphic violence at all apart from a suicide where someone sticks a knife in their own mouth. considering the amount of prostitutes in unspeakable the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum...apparently unspeakable had a budget of about $20,000 & all i can say is where did all the money go? oh, a quick note to the filmmakers, if your going to record sound live make sure you don't have your actor's deliver their lines next to a main road that half of los angeles seem to be driving up... the acting sucks, period.unspeakable is, in my opinion, total crap. it's probably not the worst i've ever seen but it's right down there & i can't remember seeing such a awful film recently. one to avoid unless your a masochist or insomniac.

i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like. . . i usually find that i am open minded about all sorts of stuff. . . but this flick is just, well, bad.i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better. i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established. . . i think it mostly boils down to script and direction though.it was just bad.i want to give this the lowest rating, but . . . i don't believe in that, at least this guy got off his tail to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average rating which this has so far)

i really wanted to like this movie, because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved "ghouls," another of ferrin's films. it did have some almost-good moments, like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene, and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure. but on the whole, it was just boring and mildly unpleasant.the "unimaginable" shocks that ferrin came up with were really predictable and worn-out. poop, murdering prostitutes, incest. could have still been good, but poorly done. unsure whether it was trying to offend, amuse, or both. ultimately did neither.in conclusion, we watch troma movies because we want films with heart. this film did not consistently feel like it had heart. there were some good scenes, but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant.

relesed from troma (which is my favorite movie company)unspeaksble is a messy horror film that can be interesting but very dark and twisted.unspeakable starts with a family in a car, they get into an accident which leaves a daughter dead and a mother deformed. the father eventually goes crazy and slashes prostitutes. he sees his daughter in other people. he kills for her. meanwhile his now deformed wife is being raped by her orderly. these are sick people! unspeakable tries to be sick and disturbing and it does manage to do that as a good horror flick this is not. most troma movies have a sense of humor to them but however this one doesn't.

as a child of the 80's like so many of the other reviewers here i hated the original v and v: the final battle. i own both on vhs and never hook up the vcr to watch them. i do remember not liking this short lived series very much, but i couldn't remember why, so i rented the first disc. by the third episode i had my memory refreshed. it's terrible. the writing is beyond horrid. it's not even fun. they had a lot of material to work with here, but it seemed like they just didn't know what to do so they turned it into 'days of our lives with lizard aliens'. how cool and full of potential is the concept of elizabeth the starchild? all they could think of to do is grow her into a whiny, boring teenager to compete with her mother romantically? marc singer looked less embarrassed to be in beastmaster ii than he did when he was trapped in this drivel....point is, whether you're one of the younger folk who's just discovered v or one of us older sci-fi fans looking to rediscover some old fun, spare yourself and skip this!

firstly i loved the book, more so than the more popular da vinci code and although the dvc film was not well received, i liked it and bought the dvd. however, there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again.the film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there.from the very start of the film i was disappointed, in the book robert langdon receives a call and fax from maximilian kohler, director of cern. who finds the body of father (can't remember the name) and then requests langdon to come, using the super fast plane... in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... in the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on, when the camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been maximilian kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and olivetti was shot... (err i think i got this right, but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the film)...there was no love interest between vittoria and robert and in the book she wasn't at cern when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. in the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. in the book vittoria was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the camerlingo. the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm. ok in the book we are led to believe that langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... there was no mention of how vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of vittoria.in all one of the worse films i have seen, i would have left early, but my brain went numb and i lost the use of my legs temporarily. a really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of ron howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! i want my money back!!!

ron howard and his "editors" only had one job to do... follow the guidelines of the book which was "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and highly cinematic in its approach! what they did? they changed everything and i mean everything! what is left is something that has no right being called "angels & daemons"! i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for "this" film.i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless.......

the implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble fr mckenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. mckenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. and, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. i have always used independence day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (us president commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. for such an implausible film, angels and demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the volkswagen? i felt like shouting, "you are going to be blown up". who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? who didn't spot the baddie? technically also, the film was awful. the dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. moreover, many scenes looked like mud. the one redeeming feature was the shots of rome and what looked like the vatican -- an achievement, because i am sure that the vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around st peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. rome is a magic place, and i enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.

why did they not follow the book ... i am really sad and disappointed. i was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. my wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.reasons for the disappointment are: 1) cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that vittoria's father was burned with the first illuminati brand, which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie_ 2) story-line between the (deceased) pope and camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) story-line between langdon and vittoria vetra completely non-existentall-in-all, too flaky storyline, and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it. maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time, when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid)really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations

i went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book. there were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the divinci code. i went to see the divinci code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. it was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. unfortunately, angels and demons disappointed on almost every level. throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. they blow past the various immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. the final illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. in my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the langdon character is all about. overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10

personally, the book was a very well written, amazing, thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me, seeing that it affected the "different" outcome of the movie. there was something to be desired out of this movie, but all in all, it lacked in plot.for someone who has not read the book, i could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, i did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.with major characters missing (such as maximilian kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. the hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the illuminati, however, in the movie, his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand.

it is difficult to imagine how the engaging dan brown novel "angels and demons" could misfire as badly as this film version. here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. due to the spoilers, please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.(1) in the film, there was no love relationship between robert langdon and vittoria vetra. worse still, there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. (2) the breathtaking locations in rome, as described in the novel, were not realized visually in the film. i am aware that director ron howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. but there are superior photographed depictions of rome on the history channel than in this film where the eternal city was presented in eternal stock film footage. the great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. the magnificent bernini sculpture of the "ecstasy of st. teresa" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the west ponente relief in vatican square was not visible at all.(3) the most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved john paul ii. in the novel, the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.(4) one of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, maximilian kohler, director of cern, was cut out of the screenplay.(5) there were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.(6) there were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. this technique worked in "the godfather" films, but ron howard is no gordon willis.(7) the college of cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a southern drawl. this dude would have been more at home on a texas ranch than in the sistine chapel.(8) the crucial relationship of the camerlengo and the deceased pope was not defined in the film. this relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the illuminati to the plot against the church.(9) in the novel, the character of hassassin was an unforgettable villain. in the film, that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. (10) as a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.in the novel, langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the tiber river. in ron howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the tiber.

i'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie, it couldn't happen fast enough. just to end the movie. i don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. it fooled me into a bad night.

maybe in its day this movie was special. but five decades later it seems quaint, just another cinematic relic of the dreadful 1950s. stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three female gold diggers who set up shop in a manhattan penthouse, in an effort to attract wealthy husbands.i don't mind the shallow theme. but the film's premise is lame. and the execution is worse. it's a romantic comedy, but i found little to laugh at. the plot point about an extremely nearsighted bimbo is about the only clever element of the story. overall dialogue is flat, and so too is the delivery. and the script structure is disconcerting. the plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies. it's as if the writer couldn't quite blend the ensemble roles. the result is a plot that seems choppy.marilyn monroe was a good choice for her role. but lauren bacall was too old for the role she played. and betty grable, with her squeaky voice and awful hairdo, was just plain annoying.color cinematography is conventional. but there were lots of shots using rear screen projection, contributing to a dated look. the visuals are made even worse by costumes that reek of cheesy 1950's "glamour"; they are just awful. viewers must endure a fashion show, a plot point that amplifies how the film's director was smitten by those trashy glad rags.and then there is that orchestra. in what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history, the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some dreary-sounding tune. at first, i thought i was watching the introduction to coming attractions. but no, it's actually part of the film. and the orchestra plays on, and on, and on. it has nothing, absolutely nothing, whatever to do with the story. what were they thinking?i enjoyed marilyn monroe, with her breathy voice, as she bimbos her way through the plot. but the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles, dumped that orchestra, enhanced the comedy dialogue, and downplayed those gaudy, cheesy costumes.

first, a warning. 'how to marry a millionaire' comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of 'street scene', a gershwin-lite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of, well, gershwin. sitting through it takes some patience. if you have the dvd, rest assured, you can skip forward. you won't miss anything.the film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50's hollywood, a movie so bolstered by major star-power, opulent mise-en-scene and perfect high-concept that failure seems inconceivable. the title alone is perfect. generation after generation, however, are forced to ask themselves - how is this so limp? the script is an albatross about the production's neck, a dead, smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life. there are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop, the movie quickly moves on to other, less interesting things. a case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. one of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity. one of the dates is married. a classic hollywood farce set-up, surely, complete with mistaken identity, angry wife, and probably a pie in the face for somebody? well, no. instead, we cut between the three dates as the ladies react 'comically' to things their partners say. hit the punchline, and cut to the next limp joke. if in doubt, have marilyn walk into a wall. where's billy wilder when you need him?the three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic hollywood screen goddess. this was one of marilyn monroe's breakout films, and the camera just eats her up, even though the script gives her nothing to do. she's so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched. lauren bacall, on the other hand, had been a major star for nearly a full decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with monroe. she gets the only thing passing for a real role, and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. she's a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty, it isn't instantly ridiculous - and far less girlish than her co-stars, giving her a convincing authority. betty grable was far from ageless, and had a good eight years on her co-stars, putting her near the end of her hollywood career. there's an air of desperation about her at times, stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing, unable to play her real age but fooling no-one as a contemporary of this new, sharper generation of actresses, relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career (for marilyn-doubters, seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw monroe's subtlety and - yes - intelligence into sharp relief). she's also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male co-stars (although all of the men - even the great william powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them. better to have given her role to the under-utilised monroe, who could be funny all by herself, and left grable with the repetitive mr. magoo routine.that the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious hollywood production, the sort that renders even the twee likes of 'by the light of the silvery moon' watchable. but somewhere, buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism, lies the rough outline of a sharp, cynical comedy about the business of marriage that bacall could have made sing - and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'how to marry a millionaire' in expectation of that movie, ready to be disappointed all over again.

this show can most accurately be described as tv bubble-gum: it's chewing, it has a good taste to it, and it lasts a long time. but, like bubble-gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews.this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games, like hangman, guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list. callers are the contestants, and anybody can play.the questions, though, are terribly easy. there's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop. it never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show anyway. the hostess, however, regardless of which one that it, is extremely personable, pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions. i rather enjoy that british woman.but there's nothing to this show. it's simplistic and uncompelling, although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on.

the female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking. they can also talk like there's no tomorrow. otherwise, this show would go into the toilet quickly. how much money do they make on all the people who text in, with that hope to be called back to win, $100.oo, or whatever. boy, now that's a scam!!! can i buy stocks in this money maker??? let's face it, with the technology of now, thousands of people could be calling every minute. and, with ten thousand channels and nothing worth a crap on, thousands of people watch this show. "oh, i know this answer!", is probably a super common line among the listeners. with these super hotties constantly saying the 'lounge' needs callers, i think it's a bunch of b.s. frequently, someone who does get through, sounds amazed that they're actually talking to the host. many of them sound depressed and worn out by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get on and score some pocket change. wow, the producers must be just raking it in. no wonder there are so few commercials. commercials are only on to give time for more (primarily losers) to text in and wait, and hope, and dream, and fantasize about--- what? --- winning enough money for a tank of gas and a dinner at mc..something? i only watch it now & then on my brothers tv, because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer. i'll sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at mel (one of the tastiest looking women on tv) and laugh at the scam that's in front of me. then, i have to leave; even if i don't! people who have an active life, can only take this show in extreme moderation. mel, get yourself into the movies, or tv sitcoms, or something. many of us are infatuated with you! even with the super cu-ties, i'm amazed this show is still on!

this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history. the film version of cromwell's growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off. this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant: both sides were protestant. cromwell was never present at the battle of edgehill, nor did he ever "save the day". the royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw.as another reviewer has noted, cromwell was certainly not one of the "five members" who were to be removed from the house and arrested. overall, this movie was decent. the producers tried way to hard and it didn't turn out so great. definitely could have been better.

hope floats with sandra bullock is a real disappointment. the story starts off ok. her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. so she has to rebuild her life. here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line, but you become so bored with it. she moves back with her parents and harry connick jr. who plays justin begins hitting on her. the two have no real chemistry at all, yet your supposed to get the impression that justin is in love with her. the movie ends the way you figure it will but you wish it hadn't ended like every other kind like it. they had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss.

everyone i know loves this movie, but i am afraid that i don't. i hated this film so much that i had to turn it off mid-film because of the repulsion. way too much time is spent on weepiness and emotional bedlam, the point of the bullock character being devastated by her divorce is jackhammered into the viewer's head excessively. enough already!! and why didn't we hear more about her ex-husband? he is portrayed as nothing but a suit who comes by once in a while. something must of made her want to marry him, what was it? what is it about him that makes her so devastated upon their divorce? more time could of been spent on that rather than yet one more shot of bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor. the dialogue is stilted, cliched and terrible, much like one of those corny "abc afterschool specials" or something. there is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film, it is all very predictable and therefore boring. this movie also goes into overdrive on the cutsiness factor, very stupid and not funny like it was supposed to be! this is just another one of those horribly done "i am woman, hear me roar" films, much like "waiting to exhale". if you want to see "i am woman, hear me roar" films that are truly entertaining, original and well-done, then see "gas food lodging" or "ruby in paradise". skip this crap!! i give "hope floats" 3/10.

terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through, every aspect being awful.the combined talents of top actors kevin bacon and gary oldman are totally wasted, and though they give good performances, one wonders why they bothered. the script from mark kasdan is a complete mess, and martin campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place, but if you're unable to follow it, take it as a blessing. there are far too many pointless, crazy scenes that just don't make sense. jerry goldsmith's music is not much help either.even if there was potential in the plot, director campbell's approach has utterly ruined it. avoid at all costs!monday, february 26, 1996 - video

the only thing that makes this one watchable is corey's performance as the lunatic killer on the loose. what remains is a most impossible tale of revenge and matrimonial discord. during the walkie-talkie scenes i had the feeling that cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device. another interesting thing about this one is that alan hale (the skipper from "gilligan's island") is not yet so fat, and he can still lower his arms below his waist. other than that there isn't much to recommend here.

respected western auteur budd boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability. boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads joe cotton and rhonda fleming put little effort into their roles, delivering lines flatly and without energy. mild mannered employee leon "foggy" poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process. he escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn't you know in the films final moments we have foggy trailing feet behind the victim (who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move) while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take. sound preposterous? you should see it. it's all of that and more. lucien ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace. as poole, wendell corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer. these attributes aside killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear. go western old budd.

first, i must point out that the role wendell corey played was exceptional. usually, corey was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film. without him and the character he played, the film would have been a lot worse--hardly meriting a 2 or 3.so why did i hate the rest of the film so much? well, one of my pet peeves is when characters act "too stupid to live". you can't base major plot points on the assumption that your major characters are completely stupid (unless having a brain injury is part of the plot, of course). but this is exactly what happens in this film. wendell corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph cotten's wife. so what do they do? yep, they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all (no marksman and guys with shotguns that are so far away they probably won't stop this madman). and if this isn't bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be! is anyone that stupid?!?! arrrggghhhh---i hate when movies have such dumb characters. in fact, i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors! in addition to these clichéd characters, there was also a bit player who fainted. sure, seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint, however in real life this is a rare occurrence--people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason. so, combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism--something film noir movies must have.all these serious problems are even more infuriating since wendell corey's character is amazingly well-written and conceived. it was his chance to shine as an actor--too bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk. this is one film that could really use a remake--but this time without brainless characters.

great actors, good filming, a potentially interesting plot, and what should have been good dialog. nothing else is good about this movie. perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. within 10 minutes i disliked the portrayal of kim by caroleen feeney so much that it became a distraction. while kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character, i am not sure i was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her. the first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that wes (david strathairn) goes from "i am missing $50.00" to "she stole 50$" in about 3 seconds. it was quite implausible, since she (kim) never had access to his wallet nor was she a master pickpocket-- there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that... we lost it. same goes for kim later. all very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (i think) a look at real people. the character of kim was, at minimum, suffering from a bipolar disorder. wes had huge inadequacy issues, nancy was just boring, and matt was delusional (particularly about music). i actually turned this off about 2/3 of the way through. however, to write a valid comment, i forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie. no, sorry, it was still bad. make it a point to miss this one.

i saw this as a kid, before it had been yanked from the rotation, and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth. there were some competently worked out gags, but making slapstick villains out of american citizens who'd been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless. moe himself might have wanted this one buried. he was a liberal guy. in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated south, where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close. moe stepped into the street to show it wasn't a problem, and the man then got back on the curb. then off again. finally, the man told moe nervously that if moe didn't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him, he might get them both lynched.another thing: there are exploding ostrich eggs but no oxen in the film, so the title should actually be (if anyone cares) "the yolk's on me."

"the yoke's on me" is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the stooges' 23 years of shorts. the reason is understandable; by today's standards, this film can be considered racist. for this reason, it is rarely shown, if ever, on television.let me just state that, for the record, the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers; they were japanese-americans sent to a relocation center during world war ii. they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film. by all accounts - including the us government, who made an apology and reparations in the 1980s - japanese-americans during world war ii were as loyal and hardworking as any american. their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in american history.there are some stooge laughs in this film, but the memories of how japanese-americans were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value. let's not confuse the loyal japanese-americans with their representation in this film as evildoers. loyal japanese-americans and the world war ii-era evil empire of japan are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.

i have just written a comment to "aces high" (1976) and that remind me of this film which i watched as kid when it was released; since then i have watched it only once and that was more than enough. as kevin well says "it is a complete waste of time". apart from the dog-fights which are nicely done the rest is a sequence of badly patched scenes with actors struggling with a lousy script and equally lousy direction. i do not remember the silly german accents mentioned by kevin in his comment, but that is another pathetic mistake; if corman tried to make more convincing the characterization of the german pilots why didn't he use german actors or have those parts dubbed? on the other hand is good example of the appalling hollywood-style of film-making with their "villains" so clearly identifiable, not only by their cruel actions but also by their grotesque accents.talking about "cruel actions" the ridiculous scene were lieutenant hermann goering murders english nurses during an attack on an airbase is an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda done with "historical hindsight". if you want to a see a factual, moving, very well acted and directed film about the air war during wwi watch "aces high" (1976) or that wonderful classic "the dawn patrol" (1938) you shall not be disappointed.

thats not saying much. this killjoy film has better cinematography and is more professional looking than the last. that doesn't mean it's more professional sounding. that horrible last film was about gangsters killing a kid and then being haunted by a voodoo clown. i thought the guy that played killjoy in the last one was a bad actor, but wow!!! this killjoy is honestly the downright worst actor i've seen in any movie, and i've seen a lot of movies. thed last movie the clown came in about 15 minutes in, this one's shorter and the clown doesn't even come in until 40 minutes in, and it's only 65 minutes long!!! i give it a 2 because the acting from some characters is ok.

...the first? killjoy 1. but here's the review of killjoy 2:(contains spoilers, so beware readers)oh my. oh, my, my, my. i'll start off with telling you that i had no hopes in the least bit that this movie would be good. considering that killjoy (the first movie) is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, the sequel didn't have much promise.as expected, it didn't deliver.the deaths were even lamer than in the first movie. there was absolutely no eye candy whatsoever, and every single prop looked so fake that i wouldn't be surprised if they had a kindergarten class make them.look, i don't even know where to begin. hm, for starters, the movie wasn't even feature length. it was only an hour and eight minutes long (68 min.), but then again, ending it early was actually a reprieve. in fact, that's the only reason that this movie wasn't as bad as the first, because the first was longer.usually, i don't give spoilers in reviews, but since i don't want any of you to go through the torture of watching this waste of film, i'm going to spoil away. not that there's much to spoil.let's start with the ending. killjoy is the pussiest killer ever. it takes explosions, firebombs, guns, etc. to kill all of the normal serial killers in horror movies. guess what it took to kill killjoy? a f***ing glass of water. no lie. in the end, a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on killjoy's face. then killjoy started screaming, and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dried rubber cement on his forehead. then he laid there, and the people went to sleep.now let's hit the acting. very terrible. not even one person was believable in the least bit. i don't even know what to say, other than it looks like they just hired a few hobos living on the streets to act in this film.seriously, i honestly doubt that they spent any more than 100 dollars total to make this movie. they had nothing. most of it took place in the woods, which wouldn't have cost them anything to film on. the actors weren't giving in any effort whatsoever, so it's blatant that they were probably "working" for free. they didn't have any kind of special effects or nice props, and they probably used ketchup for the blood. hell, who am i kidding? they probably didn't even spend 100 dollars. they probably spent $3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. a f**kin' movie made with a budget of $3.29.for bob's sake, they couldn't even afford to rent a cop uniform. in the end, after killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says "where is he?" and the main woman replies, "he's gone." then, suddenly, some fat goofy guy with scars on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying "you have a phone call." the girl answers and says "oh, hi mom!" and smiles. then the fat goofy guy walks along to reveal that it's a police officer. however, he's wearing khaki pants, and a regular button up green shirt, with a lame badge on the front pocket. hell, it was probably the badge that the director got when he was in safety patrol in 3rd grade. then they all got into a tan blazer and drove off as the credits rolled. they couldn't even get a police cruiser so they just got a tan blazer. f**kin' lame. killjoy didn't even have the ice cream van that he had in the first movie.killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyantly gay slasher ever. if there was a slasher that wore hot pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag, he still would not be as gay as killjoy. killjoy isn't funny either (and believe me, he did try to be).the only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat given by one of the delinquents. somebody makes a comment to some boy about not passing third grade, to which the boy responds, "i'll show you third grade!" in a threatening manner. that has to be the absolute worst threat that i've ever heard. "i'll show you third grade!"this movie doesn't even work on a "so bad, it's good" level. it's filth. unless you did something bad, and you are feeling so guilty about it that you want to punish yourself severely, don't watch this movie.just remember; if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and attempt to kill you at the same time), just throw some water at him. case closed.final rating: .1 out of 10

both killjoy 1 and killjoy 2 stunk, but the first was better. the special effects in this movie were not special at all. even though the killings were better in this installment, they were not anything to brag about. one thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters. they changed emotions suddenly, and some of their lines were just dumb. for instance one character quoted, " you better have some r.e.s.p.e.c.t. or you'll find out what is means to me." once i heard that line i figured it was of the worst i've ever heard. another thing that i hated about this movie was the fact it was too short. a successful movie has to go more than one hour and twenty minutes, like killjoy 2. if full moon makes part 3 of killjoy, that would be stooping to the lowest level they can possibly go. overall, 1 of 10.

this movie sucked! the first one was way better. no one from the first has returned in this dumb sequel and in some way that is a good thing because of the bad acting but the characters in this film are not even better. killjoy in the woods? come on! give me a break! i'm suprised killjoy's friend the blair witch didn't show up to make a cameo. bad acting, bad story and just plain out silly and boring. don't waste your time!

the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it. but i soon learned that i had been duped. i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip/eurotrip/american pie deal. but i was wrong. this movie is one of the dumbest i've seen in a long time. the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead. i can't believe national lampoon put its name on this. don't buy it, don't rent it. don't waste 2 hours of your life on this.

this movie actually hurts to watch. not only did i not laugh once, i ended up getting a serious headache. at times, i felt so sorry for the actors involved. the best way to sum it up is to note that among sex comedies, it is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time. i'm only sorry i can't give it a vote of less than one. to give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better.now i see that they're filming a sequel. hearing that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that there's just too much money in hollywood. raise their taxes!!! making a sequel to this movie may very well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be convened, or u.n. sanctions applied to the filmmakers.in short, it's a really bad movie. really, really.

i have little to no interest in seeing another awful movie, that totally lacks anything new creative or funny, abusing the national lampoon tag. how ever something caught my eye in the cast of this movie. i see danielle fishel's name i'm a big fan of boy meets world! but the movies shes in are awful. more so as a fan i'm not rewarded by seeing her terrible movies with the treasure of bare breast. so this is where my question comes in.has anyone seen this movie? and if so does danielle fishel get naked in it? would save me the 2 hours of my life i would never get back watching this terrible movie. thanks a lot

me and a buddy rented this movie the other day. at first look, it seemed to be another teen movie, which was also what we hoped for, being fans of simple horror and comedy.it seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. it quickly accelerates into something that holds a lot of potential. unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground. we had watched it for something that seemed like 1 hour, when i finally, half-sleeping, managed to say :"dude, this movie sucks" it was only 35 minutes actually... dude agreed.the problem is: the movie is simply not funny. it was undoubtedly supposed to be funny, but it failed. it failed in a way that made me sad. it kind of reminds me of myself. i had the potential to be anything i wanted, and instead i ended up watching cheap horror/funny movies all the time. i pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart. its so sad. all that potential.. and nothing.

when i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny. the picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers (such as road trip)which i thought would be worth watching. when i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy. the only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a wet floor. this is not a joke and would not make people laugh. i actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through. i was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out. not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it. i found the acting to be quite bad as well. the only time i laughed was at the extremely bad 'jokes'or actions done which were really not funny!!!. i rate this film a 1/10. i hope you found this comment useful.

worthless movie. a complete waste of time and nothing what i expected it to be. the packaging makes it seem as if it is of the american pie genre (it isn't). rather it is a ridiculous stringing together of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise (let's try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad snl skit into a full length feature presentation). what is remarkable is that the director's (based on their commentary on the dvd) take themselves completely seriously. i have been a huge fan of the movies that national lampoon lends its name to, up to and including van wilder. with this one, i feel completely cheated. in fact, i feel duped. i was expecting a van wilder like farce to relive my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage. what lead to my ultimately unmet expectations? well, for starters, the fact that the cast all appear naked (with an enormous sausage covering what must be covered) on the cover of the dvd. add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a movie that it is not. to make matters worse, the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half-naked drunk college students feebly trying a photo stunt, but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. in fact, i didn't even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until i was told so by the directors in the commentary. don't get me wrong, i love plot twists and being surprised by movies, but i hate the fact that this movie tries to pawn itself off as something it is not. ultimately, it does itself a huge disservice (artistically, though most likely not financially) because it sets its audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises. in short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case. it is not your usual national lampoon movie. the only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and tv shows that make their involvement here entertaining.

this has to be one of the biggest misfires ever...the script was nice and could have ended a lot better.the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade. maybe hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director.sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad.if i had to re-watch it it would be like torture. i don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine so..my advice is watch the movie first..see if u like it and after vote(do not vote before you watch it ! ) and by the way... have fun watching it ! don't just peek...watch it 'till the end :))))))))) !!

this movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. how many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you cram into just one movie? notes are misplaced, bags are switched, conversations are misheard, people get mixed up, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh about something. the writers are really struggling to keep everything going, which makes the dialogues feel really forced. if anyone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be resolved in around two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives, but they have to keep the misunderstandings going. at times this movie also tries to go for some juvenile laughs, but all those do is remember you about how funny "american pie" was. the scene with the nerd telling the hooker (who he thinks is a foreign exchange student) to "eat his sausage" goes on forever, not one second of it is funny. i've got to give this movie some credit though: because of the subplot about stolen money, it's not as boring as it could have been. it also has a laugh here and there, but then sadly goes back to yet another character misunderstanding stuff. overall this movie is just way too lame.

jeez, when i heard this movie was a national lampoons i thought it was going to be awesome, but i really got a say it was a rather disappointment. i have seen the most movies they've made, from christmas vacation to van wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their name,, really bad actors and a to much intense movie. this movie is probably good to watch if you are watching it with a crowd of worked up people and the ability to laugh at it, but if you are into good comedy's like i am, i do not suggest this movie, i would much rather watch van wilder a second or third time, than to watch this movie... you have been warned.

national lampoon's dorm daze is easily the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen the movie kazaam. anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way, shape, or form has no idea what a good movie is, and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupid.its hard to name everything wrong with this movie. first off, the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple "misunderstandings" very well at all. the acting is awful to say the least, and the whole thing was poorly made. any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever again!it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two, because it is so bad, but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie!! if you want a good movie to watch, go turn on anything else on television. even u.s.a. has better movies than this._friend.

the palestinian situation is fertile and as-yet largely fallow soil for film-making. 'divine intervention' tries hard, and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles, but the film amounts to little more than a handful of (admittedly lovely) visual jokes thrown onto celluloid, while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses. a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue.

won't be long on this movie. the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies. the story didn't advanced, nothing was explained about any of the characters. it felt like a non-movie. (a lot of people had already left the audience at this point).a lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained.the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence, each scene, has to make the story go forward. he never did that.the supposedly funny moments were contrived, and only a few people laughed (people with a weird sense of humor, i guess).prize of the jury in cannes 2002.....don't know what the jury was thinking about....probably the "politicly correct effect".i would have loved to love it, the disappointment was therefore even bigger.you have to see it to believe it. but wait for the video.

this is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep.utterly boring long silent(yes, silent) strings of unrelated video clips.instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow- it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing arabs being malicious to everyone around them.sulieman (the director) should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film.it deserves a one for the movie quality, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof.)

a brazilian cable television is presenting "yadon ilaheyya" this month in its "cult" channel. i saw the trailer and listened to the advertisement, and decided to see this movie. indeed it is an absurd boring pretentious dumb pointless disconnected crap about the conflict in the middle east, and together with "soultangler", they certainly are the worst movies i have tried to see. i really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap, highly indicated for torturing enemies. how can this movie be awarded and nominated to prizes inclusive in cannes? my vote is one (awful).title (brazil): "intervenção divina" ("divine intervention")

i was very concerned about this film, it was scheduled to play at a jewish film festival, and was reported to be very hostile to israel, while using clever humor and irony.i was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing. the film was full of random events, some of which eventually connected, most of which did not. some of the events were very clever and funny, but some were merely random and pointless.there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car, wordlessly, and play some handholding game. perhaps in some cultures this is erotic, but it's like watching thumb-wrestling. after the third time, it really became tiresome.i have always found david lynch to be gratuitously bizarre, using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they don't grasp his work; in fact, there is nothing to grasp. the same is true here, the stories do not add up to anything, and there is not much of a political point being made (in one scene a boisterous israeli soldier humiliates palestinian drivers at a checkpoint. that's news?)i don't understand why this film has garnered controversy, nor why it has garnered attention. it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time.

i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works (e.g. linda grant's when i lived in modern times)usually from the israeli side of the fence. also, a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year, so with such a recommendation...however i actually found myself nodding off at points! admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters. once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes, i went with it, but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film. i liked the concept of a restrained, almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter. but personally i think the film has been over hyped. i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything (it's definitely not) but even a little more dialogue would have helped.

this was one of the most dishonest, meaningless, and non-peaceful of the films i have ever seen. the representation of the other, of the israelis, was racist, backward, and unfair. for one, the song played on e.s' car radio when pulled up alongside a very right-wing israeli driver was "i put a spell on you" by natacha atlas. the song's style is quite arabic, but it was released on an israeli compilation cd, and i have even heard it on the radio in israel. many israeli songs (as well as architecture, foods, and slang) are influenced by arabic culture, and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song. the way e.s. appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist, and e.s. as noble and temperate.i have traveled all over israel, and i have never seen an idf recruitment poster, since service is mandatory. but in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words "want to shoot?" this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers, and such an "advertisement" wouldn't even exist on a random israeli highway. in including it, the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of anti-arab racists hell-bent on murder.the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent. a hollywood-style action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. but for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand, that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges, portraying the "other" as human, or working towards peace; violence is made to be the only solution. this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. one of my best friends serves in the israeli military, and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure.besides these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor. repetition became repetitious, and no longer captivating. symbols, such as the balloon with arafat drawn on it, are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting; the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem, and it is created for no reason by e.s. the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly-overt claim of an israeli double standard by the director. the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill; showing the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes, the dreariness of life, without allowing much room for personal interpretation. by contrasting one "section" of the movie, daily life in nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between ramallah and israel, the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel, but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued.i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly, and why many modern fashion-show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. i still cannot come up with an answer. i felt that the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought-provoking. i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes, but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja, or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint, albeit defiantly. in fact, i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. whatever the director's intent, it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the film.this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually address any issues. it is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side, while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side. there is no thought, reflection, or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; emotions are simply pulled to one side, and kept there, in a "good vs bad" cliché scenario. i believe this film lacked the depth, quality, and power of other palestinian films, such as "paradise now" and "wedding in the galilee."

it's not plot driven, ok; it's not a character study, fine; there's no action, alright; there's no point, hmmm...maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in palistine and parts of israel these days in a state of violence, petty disagreements, deep rooted hostility, etc. but mostly it's long, long scenes of nothing happening - or things which look like they're dripping with meaning (a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground, an arafat balloon floating into jerusalem, a crouching tiger women deflecting bullets into a halo) but when you try to derive some meaning, there's no there there.bonus: you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring.

did i waste my time. this is very pretentious film. in the beginning you will think there's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening. i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people. unbelievably boring pointless film. stay away. so many good soundtracks. i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me. i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film. stay away.1 on 10.

how many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime?well i'll go out on a limb and say one.this movie is better watched late at night,with a 12 pack of beer, the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogue.on a pacific island a young man is sentenced to death for consorting with the "evil americans".(seems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the doc' can be king).well he vows to come back and wreak revenge.before you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the american scientists' hut screaming"tobanga come!"it seems the young corpse has done just that as tobanga, the walking tree monster. yes his revenge is terrible (and so is this movie).it seems that these natives cannot run from a lumbering tree so he tosses them in quicksand,rolls them down hills etc.pretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsaw.general problems with this movie are numerous. the comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a cockney accent (like this movie needs comedy).you want her to die upon her first appearance.the leading lady is whiny.the leading man is a boor.the acting is wooden (pun intended).the dialogue is stiff and lumbering.the natives have brooklyn accents.the monster suit is pure giggles.while this is a bad movie it still is fun to watch.it gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone.your dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree wasn't mobile.

**may contain spoilers**a luckless south sea islander is executed by other (caucasian-looking) natives after he befriends visiting scientists tod andrews and tina carver. the meddlesome scientists dig him up and find that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. he comes to life and goes on a rampage and sure enough, that fifties boogeyman, the a-bomb, is blamed for this aberration. to state that this particular monster walks like it has a stick up its a** would be redundant. suffice it to say that the critter lumbers along, like the film itself, throwing his enemies into some handy quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments about. paul blaisdell created the tree-man suit and it's hardly his best work. over the years this flick has been sujected to many comments like "to hell it can go!" personally i think it's the best walking-tree movie i've ever seen.

i know it's not original, but what the hey? what else can be said about it? i feel unutterably silly just paying any attention at all to "from hell it came". the movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and dismissal, not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time.

native chief's son is wrongfully accused for the death of his father. the evil witch doctor orders to execute him. he then comes back as a murdering tree(!), tabanga. well, what can you say about such a "film"? if it was intended to be a horror film, there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved. and for a comedy, it still isn't funny enough. i don't know why people make films like this. i guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it. or you might want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree, which gives a new dimension to "a slow death". or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved. (ms. kilgore!) or the dialogue and screenplay, which were strangely ignored at the academy awards that year."shouldn't we try psycho-analysis on that tree? maybe its mother was afraid of oaks." 2/10

to call this film a disaster will be an understatement. i don't even know where to begin! i have questions though, and lots of them. i would like to know who conceived of this script? who gave them money to make this film? who was in charge of casting and costuming? they should all be sued! i saw this film in my local library's catalog and i thought "hey! great!" i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version. unbeknowst to me, that it would turn out to be a total and utter crap-fest! dhund - the fog, is a film about four friends (actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by india's 1st mrs. world, aditi govitrikar) and the director spares no expense at letting you know this. the script even claims that she (the character's name is simran) has aishwarya rai eyes, kareena kapoor lips and rani mukherjee hair. feel free to barf if you want to, at least at this point you haven't seen the film, unlike poor me. :*(anyway, simran receives a death threat one day from one of the contestants' uncle, who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning, but simran's boyfriend doesn't allow her to do this and thus she participates in the pageant and wins. this causes the crack-cocaine-sniffing uncle of her former college classmate tanya to come after her. but with the help of her cousin kajal, simran drowns the culprit and they enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body. it's tough but they eventually get around to doing it.in a scene that borrows from hollywood's film diabolique, the pool where the dead body is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a conundrum of whodunit and where-is-it? by the time the film is over, the film successful steals scenes from 'i know what you did last summer, i still know, scream 1, scream 2, scream 3, murder she wrote episodes and not to mention, columbo and scooby doo'! shameless, i tell ya!inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to: 1. a scantily clad simran answers phone-calls three times from her would-be-killer, the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer. 2. tanya tries to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest? wtf? even aishwarya rai who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didn't win miss india!3. in the pool scene, the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive. and the ball disappears too. 4. the cliché blue contacts lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, yet when his corpse surfaces again, his eyes are blue. 5. nobody who dies in the film is mourned (strange, especially for indian society).6. when vikram jumps into the dirty murky pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day. 7. sexy belly-dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm drenched song and dance number about coming of age. that would have been cool for some bachelor party, but they were celebrating simran's pageant win! hello!!!! 8. kunal, sameer, simran and kajal can neither dance nor lip synch properly. but don't blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers.9. nothing within the film was choreographed, it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want. 10. the film played out like there was no script. either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk!11. when simran's picture was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested, yet she receives death threats and never bothers to alert the police.just to mention a few of course. this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible. bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film-making.

in a up and down career with all sorts of movies, this is altman's one try at science fiction, and it clearly shows that it's not his forte.the film is practically incomprehensible. it seems a disastrous combination of experimental theater pretentiousness and a major studio trying to jump on the post-star wars bandwagon (not that this film is at all modelled after that one, but you can imagine that the studio signed on hoping for a much different paul newman sci-fi film). the story is nonexistent, the characters remain strangers to us all the way through.altman has packs of dogs feeding on dead bodies throughout the movie, obviously straining to make some sort of point. but since the movie is so poorly thought out, starting with the lack of plot on up, it really isn't about anything at all.the production designed is confused, the photography is undone by the blurs on the edges, and the score is terrible. however, "quintet" does have one redeeming feature. not only is the movie clearly filmed out in the snow and ice, but the interiors are kept cold as well. you see the actors' breath in every scene. you really feel the cold.

wow. i thought, eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing first-sex movie ever. but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete. in this case, the well-known german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. harte jungs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and above all: not funny. it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany (and, i'm afraid, also austria).tobias schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15, and his character is too dumb to be true. schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex, but that doesn't help. harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously.the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan jürgens who play schenke's semi-liberal parents. perlinger and jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. still, their performances are the `best' and `funniest' in comparison.a complete failure.

seriously, all these satan comes to earth movies always involve the catholics. why doesn't lucifer ever mess with the other denominations.the plot is that asmodeus (played by former jason vorhees kane hodder) has a plot to become human (but wasn't he always a demon) by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child. except maybe she isn't his sister. the plot isn't clear on this, and they inter-splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem.the lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact.... eeeewwwwww. her sister (played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear denise crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. praise be! well, the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off, in order, a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all being watched by an ex-military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born. we discover that asmodeus is actually a catholic cardinal who is running the whole thing.the ending is pretty much incomprehensible, and if you could make it that far straight through, you have a stronger stomach than i did. (i paused the film a couple of times, it was so awful.)

this movie was by far the best ever... i think whoever shot it with the sony hand-held camera was a genius and the special effects were spectacular especially the chicken breast heart...thank goodness this movie only cost me a dollar to rent.. also the green toxic boob discharge was amazing......i could have shot this movie with my friends in high school. .................................................................... i would not recommend this movie to anyone ... you might want to kill yourself instead of watching it..... i also feel like this was a move for porn stars trying to make it into the legitimate movie business............give it to her larz

the photography is accomplished, the acting is quite good, but in virtually every other department the greek tycoon is a dreary bore. taking its inspiration from the real-life love affair of jackie kennedy and aristotle onassis, the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long. viewers who embrace the whole "celebrity magazine culture" (paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here. but those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a butt-numbing slog.american president james cassidy (james franciscus) and his beautiful wife liz (jacqueline bisset) are in greece on official business. a ridiculously wealthy greek shipping tycoon, theo tomasis (anthony quinn), catches sight of liz at a party at his elegant manor. despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. later, at a private party aboard his yacht, tomasis makes his desires known to liz. some while later, president cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach. liz is shocked and saddened by his death, but it isn't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover tomasis. eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's newspapers, magazines, photographers and wags.it is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the kennedy-onassis story. they wanted the film to be seen as an original story, rooted in fiction. but anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration. even aristotle onassis himself knew the greek tycoon amounted to his love-life getting the hollywood treatment (if rumours are to be believed, he actually had a hand in approving anthony quinn for the tomasis role!) j. lee-thompson isn't really the right sort of director for this type of movie  he's better suited to action fodder like the guns of navarone and ice cold in alex  but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired, professional adequacy. quinn is very watchable as tomasis; bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires; franciscus uses his toothy smile and a façade of integrity to make for a believable politician. their performances are good on the surface, but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level. similarly, tony richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next, but the merest of scratches proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior.

it must be remembered that the gammera movies, like many of the first-series gozilla films, were in fact aimed squarely at kids. little kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience: they get to run around and play with top-secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it; they get to cavort with monsters, and even when the bad guys enter, they are never in any real danger.perhaps the first gammera film is an aberration because the child does get punished and is put into danger, but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment.as one critic said, these aren't failed adult movies but successful kid's movies.

more of a frisbee like turtle with fangs that go up like a wart hog. more battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits. a ping pong ball space ship. two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including getting on board the space ship. more tiresome music. more "gamera is the friend of children" stuff. i remember when godzill and rodan came out. the movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people. now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them. the adults are all ridiculous and moronic. like in american sitcoms, the kids are the bosses (when in reality they couldn't think their way out of a paper bag). these monster movies must be the japanese means of partonizing these little snots. above all, however, is that after seeing three of these movies (with the same plot over and over; check the stock footage), the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring. if you haven't see this one, don't bother.

gamera vs viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result.space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera. so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys. the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind.first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and viras. viras looks like a big squid with a beak. he has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the apendages on top of his head to make a sharp pointy weopon. so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent. viras really injures gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive this.unfortunately gamera vs viras decided to use footage from previous gamera films to fill time for this film. they re show the battles between gamera and barugon and gamera and gaos when the aliens look at gameras past battles. however when they show gamera's battles with gaos they show the battle between gamera and gaos in the city first, then they show the final battle between the two. after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and gaos they show the first battle between gamera and gaos!!! talk about showing the battles in non chronological order. they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two.another issue is that they decide to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo. so they show the scene from "gamera vs barugon" where he destroys the dam. after the show scenes from "gamera the invincible" which is a huge issue for me. mainly due to the fact that "gamera the invincible" was in black and white!!!! using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a good thing.also the dubbing is bad once again. the two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a gamera film that did not involve little kids.so the over use of footage from other gamera films is a deterrant to this film. the final fight is awesome so basically i recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film. the rest is something that has already been seen before.

"destroy all planets" winds up settling for 'destroy all tokyo' by film's end, as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls to the reptilian furnace known as gamera. actually, gamera is saving earth right from the get go, knocking out varian space ship #1 even before the first set of film credits roll. the scene switches to a japanese scout camp where we meet a pair of meddlesome young heroes, jim and masao, who take part in gamera's exploits after being kidnapped by the aliens and beamed aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield.it's pretty startling to see the boys convince a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that might be defective. previously boy genius masao had wired the unit to run in reverse direction of it's controls, but dr. dobie didn't think about checking that out as a possibility. at least that prepared the boys for interfering with the alien space ship's controls by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks.when boss alien viras says 'activate the videotron', hang on to your seats for rehashed footage from earlier gamera movies where he battles barugon and gyaos. these take up quite a bit of screen time, but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to get on with it. for the longest time viras addressed an invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were orientals who could fly - imagine that!seeing as how these movies were made for a juvenile audience, it's surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are. gamera drawing blood comes to mind, and how about the pair of space crew members being decapitated. when squid tentacles started emerging from the headless bodies i made a connection to the 'alien' films; having the individual units merge to form the giant viras was a neat device.i guess the appeal for young kids might reside in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, move around pretty freely on an alien space ship, and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien telepathy technology. seeing as how the movie was presumably made by adults, it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.

i'd never walked out of a movie before this one. i'd entertained the idea a couple of times, but this time i did it, snuck in to see the end of another movie, but had to come back and see the end of the rage while i waited for my friends. they told me i didn't miss much while i was gone, either. i was generally offended by the entire movie, in such a grand way that i can't even describe it. my gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre. it was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie. the plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others. there was no ray of light, no resonsible or likeable person to provide contrast. i found that even the "good guys" of the movie did nothing for me, were silly, stupid, whiney, or just plain ineffectual.the repetitious, graphic suicide imagery was way overdone, unnecessary, and disgusting. (not in a "i'm easily grossed out" way, but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way). and besides the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects, (interesting camera work, etc) had potential, but just became annoying sometimes. i am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. usually i can find some good things to counterbalance the not-so-good of any movie. i'm not saying that this movie had nothing good, but i am saying that, whatever that may have been, i can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad. i'm really sorry about that, too. maybe the best parts were the clips from the classic original.

one of the scariest movies i have ever seen was carrie (the first one!). now, as with other movies, they have totally ruined the carrie franchise with the rage: carrie 2. from the beginnning, the movie plods along like geriatics in a beat-up van. there are hardly any scares and this movie is chock-full of all the various high-school sterotypes (i.e. the football jock, the bitchy cheer-leader, the followers and of course the black nailpolish wearing misfits). another sad thing about this show is that you know what's going to happen the moment you see the opening credits. sure, sure, girl gets humilated thourghly and then turns into crazed psychic murderer...yawn...been there. done that.even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie. emily bergl is as frightening as a cabbage patch doll while jack london... let's just say i didn't pay to see wood act. apart from the actors, the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to link up with the first movie.bottom line, if you can beam objects around like carrie, then for the love of god beam yourself out of that theatre......

**could be considered some mild spoilers, but no more than in anyone else's review of this film.**i knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original "carrie," which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire. carrie white was "victim" epitomized, and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel.whoever conceived the "rachel" character for "the rage" must have completely missed the subtleties of "carrie." for the audience to genuinely share the victim's rage, s/he must be a sympathetic character-- a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his/her own vices. rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of sissy spacek's "carrie." and she looks and acts like she should be right along-side the 'attractive and popular brigade' that she ends up torching. she, like the rest of them, has a soul that is every bit as corrupt, whereas carrie was a complete innocent.it just doesn't work. there's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children-- not even the "home improvement" boy-- getting offed in this movie's climactic scene. and it's so unnecessarily gory! there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym! and there is one person in particular that this movie should not have had the audacity to kill off... but i won't say who it is. if you've seen the original "carrie," it's the sort of character who dies unjustly.at least they did create the connection to carrie appropriately; it's explained as it should have been. but that, and the arm tattoo, which was done rather nicely, is just about the only thing this movie has going for it.yet another hideous "scream" knock-off, and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. rating: 1 out of 10. i wasn't expecting much, but i was still horribly disappointed. an unsympathetic character, a series of irritating pop-culture references thrown in for no good reason, and an ending scene that pales in comparison to "carrie"'s gravestone shocker.

this is not great cinema. the film is cliche ridden and in many places it is a copy of the original carrie. the parallels with the original film are striking but with an added improbability about the telekenetic powers being congenital.i can't say that i disliked the film because it at least passed a couple of hours ... but these were passed as one would read an undemanding book on a long train journey. that book would not be great literature but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards in that it would blend in with the numerous other cliche ridden books. likewise the film was okay whilst it lasted but is perhaps forgettable. at least i think it is. i cant remember much about it now!!

the filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects, but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly. we never get a chance to see the "monster" move from one place to another - whenever that happens (supposedly), the camera focuses on the "terrified" reactions of the humans that are nearby. and when a man is attacked by it, he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it won't fall to the ground. this is still not the worst "alien" rip-off around (the two "xtro" films are even worse, for example); it's actually sufficiently entertaining if you've got 68 (!!) minutes to spare. (*1/2)

i have an affection for these twists on british social norms and it is rare that one loses me. but our betters did lose me a bit. it's a tale of social climbers and their joy at breaking the rules but personally i found it a little dull. i liked the duchess though she whines a little too much and constance bennett amiably fills the role of lady greyston, a role that bette davis could have played backwards.but the movie comes the life in the third act when ernest joins the party. he is so lively and fun (and in truth probably wears more makeup then lady greyston). he gets the last line of the film and it's a gas!

i want to believe all new horror films coming out of japan these days are edgy and make for enjoyable watching.spider forest is neither.it is seldom that i finish watching something and end up teed off for the waste of time, but spider forest was an exception in this regard. i was very teed off. the makers of the film succeeded on one level; throughout the film i could not stop because i wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun by the storyline. i could not stop watching. that's why i was so angry when the film finished... they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this poc? warning: spider forest is another one of those japanese "ghost" stories, though you don't realize that going in.i never want to see a japanese ghost story again. they're phony and contrived. "it's a ghost story" has become like a big rug under which to sweep any and all unresolvable plot holes you have in your story-telling.

this is the one movie that represents all that is bad in the movie business. the actors are pathetic and the script is awful. the special effects, if there are any, are so badly done that it would have been better to do it with cartoons instead. besides that it's great! i think the creators of the movie meant it to have humor, but the only time i was laughing was when i saw patrick s. with long hair and the colorful costumes that every one had. the scenes at the end were good but they were not a part of the movie. in the end you will ask yourself "why did i waste my time and money with that crap when i could have watched the plants growing or the clouds moving". i don't think that i am some critic or anything but this is a truly lame movie! do not watch! danger of stupidity overload!

wow! that james purefoy looks exactly like thomas jane!that's the most profound thought i took with me after having seen the rather underwhelming george and the dragon. for a fantasy comedy, the story was very dull and the effects unspectacular.the problem wasn't the acting. james purefoy makes a good knight, and his various side-kicks are not bad characters. i even thought patrick swayze in this role was a pretty good idea, too. flat-chested piper perabo also had some nice potential. i even liked the kid.but the story and everything that happens, and the *way* it happens, was just "eh". not interesting. compared to another recent fantasy comedy, ella enchanted, which was actually funny, this movie comes up terribly short. i'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawn-inducing trudgery.4 out of 10.

how can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond me.the idea? it has none. "a guy fell apart". that's the idea. wow. an environment was slowly killing him... now that's original and worth watching.this is the first fasbinder's film i've seen... i've heard that he's a genius of mise-en-scene, but i've seen student films with more attention, inspiration, idea, and craft than this... this.... this nothing. it has nothing!each and every shot is too long. there's so much emptiness in them... the acting's horrible. you can see the actors had no preparation at all, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt at showing emotions... it's so... superficial... the lines are so explicative that you could removed 90% of them and still have the same crappy film. tempo? who cares about it. atmosphere, dynamics, that's for pussies! one shot per scene, 80% of the time people staring unrealistically, having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another... editing? all rules of editing have been disregarded with no pa pay-off of any kind... photography? half of the shots have reflection in them, and crappy lighting with no stylization of any kind. shadows, play of shadows... who needs that? we need a guy pissing, drinking, hitting his wife like he's... like he's acting. we need a bunch of close ups of a not-so-beautiful woman... we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing arabian torturer... this film has so much wrongs that it isn't worth the no-budget it had.frankly, i haven't seen a film this bad since american pie 5. yup. that bad.i've just started watching his "veronica foss" movie, which seems much better, based on the first 15 minutes (since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea, unlike this crap), so i won't argue that fasbinder's clueless.... but this.... this film sucks!

a movie that tries hard to say something and generally fails. like the fatuous academics that populate the movie, it meanders aimlessly, substituting endless (it seems like forever listening to it) conversation for some action or plot direction.sadly, it's one of the best examples of canadian cinema i've seen.

a lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this film, but it only made me feel misanthropic. if smug "intellectuals" bantering about their irritating sex lives, sounds ok to you, watch it. i felt bored, but glad i did know people like that. the premise of the film was that, as with all societies or great civilizations, they are eventually doomed to fail. according to the female historian character, who bores us with this fact, america is showing signs of it's decline (admittedly she goes into greater detail than me). the next part of the film is concerned with the vacuous, fatuous and asinine behaviour of her friends and colleagues, and the various miseries caused by their libidinous behaviour, with a vague attempt at humor. a lot of people liked this movie where i watched it. i could not relate to it.

history and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do, but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986. basically, the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves--which they hide from themselves with more sex. this drive is linked to "the decline of the american empire", as expressed in an early interview within the movie.so the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting rapidly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement. and to give arcand credit, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone.but yeah, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. i think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last, which makes it kind of dated. it's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like susan sontag that makes art-house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers. in all, i'll take it anyway--it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are--it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters.--polarisdib

i'm rating 'the decline of the american empire' just about below average since it wasn't terrible, but also not great. i liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. that was probably the most original aspect  a dialogue-laced sexual small film with people who are extremely far from models. that aside, it seems ironic that these french-speaking canadians have a movie about a neighboring society that, well, is in 'decline' when their own actions are their own demise. a group of women friends and male friends spend half the movie laughing it up on their infidelities and acceptance of such behavior and the other half "intellectually" speaking of how powerful they are for their speech and actions. these are the normal targets in typical sitcoms the main characters make fun of at parties occupied mainly by college professors. sadly, it's not their "intelligence" or mastery of "history" that disturbs me. it's their pedestal made of ego and mightier-than-thou attitude that pushes me away and not one character could i relate to, nor like. when one cries, i couldn't care less  it's your bed. when one complains, i barely flinched. what made me skirmish was one character, uh, peeing red. (another example of playing with fire.) sure, i understand it happens to some people, but it was hard to watch. and i sincerely hoped the he washed his hands as he had no problem going right back to cooking for everyone. on the complete opposite end of the noses-up educators, they introduce a stereotypical nomad. this made me cringe as no one seemed real; everyone was as shallow as their laughter on society. unfortunately, with no one left to root for, you're left as empty as these character's souls.

i saw this movie and was bored out of my mind! i am a fan of peanuts, but i can't understand why charles schultz let this disaster be made! spoilers ahead.i can't believe snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and swig a few cold ones without standing watch! the story was complete nonsense, even for comic strip characters. it takes them toooo long to get to france, plus once they get to france i had a feeling that the writer (i still can't believe it was schultz) didn't know what to do once they got there.peanuts is best made in 30 minute episodes, not 80 minute movies.go home charlie brown, you are at your best there.

not bad performances. whoopi plays the wise/warm role quite well. still, the storyline and situations can not be believed (forced pc stereotypes). at times it is good jews and blacks vs. the evil white christians (ho-hum). a typical hollywood fantasy. the film does have its moments, but it is not one that i would recommend to go out of your way to view.

here's example number 87,358 of hollywood's anti-biblical bias, so typical of them.early on, ray liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. the first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that "there will be two hours of bible study ever day."this is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. once again, the bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people. that woman, of course, is dismissed immediately.naturally, the liberal black woman (whoopi goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voilà, saves the day! yawn.

this movie has been advertised for over three months in greece as the biggest greek production ever. well, it could be, but... when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new, something different. what you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence. george corraface looks like he didn't really enjoy making this movie. his acting is so simplistic, that looks almost amateur. the sound, especially when some of the turkish actors speak english (dubbed?), is full of hiss. the, thankfully few, special effects showing istanbul and athens in the late 50's and early 70's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) up to 1968 (age 14), but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later.so much for "the biggest greek production". at least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. and all one gets is a love story between 7 year-olds, who meet again 40 years later. oh, there is a political side, too. a couple of ironic remarks about the greek "junta" of '67-'74, so childish that seem almost forced.there are, of course a couple of good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, mainly ieroklis michaelidis, the very good scenery and the magnificent music by evanthia remboutsika; but they are so few for such an expensive production.bottom-line: is it so bad a movie? to tell the truth i don't know. i just know that in no point does it justify its huge (for greek standards) budget.

world war i gets a glossy, sepia-tinted makeover in jean-pierre jeunet's relentlessly whimsical "a very long engagement". jeunet's trademark style consists of mechanical, almost clockwork-like narrative construction garnished with lavish, chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux-naive humour. it's an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture, the romantic fantasy "amelie", thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of audrey tatou in the title role. applied to vastly more sombre material, jeunet's method backfires rather badly.tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly off-beat character as amelie. she's mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart manech (gaspard ulliel), several years after he went missing in the war. manech was one of five soldiers court-martialled for self-mutilation in 1917 at 'bingo crepuscule', and sent over the top into no-man's-land as a punishment. he's presumed dead by all but mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him. the film follows mathilde's dogged quest to find out what really happened, and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad, even shocking story of high-ranking corruption and inhumanity. mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting, overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be manech's final hours.all this should be poignant and gripping, but it's more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which jeunet pummels his audience. there's simply too much going on at any one time, including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters. without a moment's respite from informational overload, i felt denied the space to reflect on mathilde's quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms. jeunet's unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles, caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production, but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the story's skin. the result is deeply uninvolving, and worse, grotesque. the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history. imagine it re-created as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known belgian lager, and you have the measure of this film.

the new celebrity deathmatch is terrible. they kill off the popular people and make the low budget celebs win. i mean...andy milonakis? lil' flip? lil flip and lil wayne should of both died.lil' flip sucks. the fight between lil' jon and lil' bow wow and lil flip was mad corny and short. they should of just kill off all of them. why did tobey lose to jake and christian lose to adam? they are better actors and superheroes. they also spend too much time on talking rather than fighting which can bore the viewers. everything seems rushed for some reason, they can't just make a long fight? the old deathmatch is way better.

the movie is precious, and cage is a babe. but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is atrocious?!?! where's the clash? the ramones?? misfits? social distortion? the cramps?? sex pistols?! anyone?!?!?!?! the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at least they play the cure.plus, randy's feathered hair and pleated khakis...this definitely looks like a movie about "punks" the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punks.although it's a 90's movie, slc punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980's. just sayin'.

another day - this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it. i thoroughly enjoy watching shannen doherty and i was quite interesting in seeing how well julian mcmahon and shannen appeared together following the roles they played in charmed. i can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film, even the directing - but the plot...what happened? i am at a loss for words because i am still confused. i have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot. i also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot-madness i would still watch it over and over again.

this movie was terrible...how can somebody even think that this movie was like the ones back in the "good old days" when tim thomerson was not even in it. and to make things worse, they used clips from old trancer movies. thats just terrible. no trancer movie is complete without tim thomerson.i love fullmoon films, and i have been watching them since i was 4 years old. i have been through everything they have done and this movie almost made me lose it. now i got a couple of lines to fill so i will keep going. their way of breeding new trancers is completely stupid as well as way to send jack back in time. what happened to the tcl chamber. and finally! what happened in the end of trancers 5 where lina says and i quote "jack has given me something special" and her and some other broad looks at her stomach. i don't know...maybe a baby is in there. there were so many other places of going to, but fullmoon s'd the bed

okay, granted, i am a fan of low-budget horror, which along with it, does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to...trancers 6, directed by demonicus's jay woelfel.first of all, the trancers series, started back in the mid-80s by charlie band and his empire pictures, is basically the franchise that it is because of tim thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trancer hunter jack deth. well, low and behold, due to the sinking budgets of full moon features (which, despite what people have said, have actually brought along very high quality features, such as hell asylum and dead & rotting), thomerson did not return for the sixth installment.full moon writer courtney joyner returns once again and delivers another below-average screenplay, which features jack deth (played by thomerson...in flashbacks, which are extremely poorly inserted...he has a different hair style like every time he is shown, and some `shemp' laying on a table) going down the line into his daughter's body. well, from here on out, you have "jo deth" acting like jack...but its a shame that she really doesn't give off the same screen presence as jack deth did.the film, shot on 16mm, is, simply put, an embarrassment to the trancers name...no offense to anyone at young wolf productions. i mean, i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a trancers film without tim, but with a little more time (despite it being filmed since december of 2001), it could have been better.however, check out full moon's dvd of it, which is a double feature with the original trancers, and features trailers for the last 10 plus full moon features.overall, i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn't have the trancers name, but like anything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself!

i know that full moon, or any other film studio for that matter, could never recapture the fun and cheesy sci-fi feeling that was the original `trancers.' and with the last two entries in the series having jack deth in medieval times instead of futuristic los angeles, it became quite obvious that there really was little hope in reviving the trancers series. breathing new life into a film is one thing, but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past, well, it didn't work! so now with trancers 6, full moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we don't even deal with jack deth any more. we now deal with his daughter, jo. jack is in her body and must go into the past and fight the trancers one more time.*minor spoiler: first scene of the film revealed*	to prove how bad this movie is, you only need watch the first two minutes of the film when the original jack deth appears on the screen. but it's not actually tim thomerson. it's clips of him and sound bytes strung together (trust me, you can tell they're strung together) horribly to provide the viewer the last of the true jack deth humor. and from this point on, things only go down hill. having this girl, jo deth, as our main character while jack deth is supposed to be in her body, is the worst idea in the world. having this cute young woman act as a rough and tough man isn't the right track at all! it doesn't work and it really comes off as foolish.	i'm not going to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most reading this know what full moon has become: a really, really, low budget enterprise. i don't know what to say about this movie, except i really wish full moon could be like it was in the days of demonic toys, puppet master, and trancers 1. back then, while the special effects weren't great, the story telling was. they made serious b-movies for serious b movie and horror fans, and that just doesn't take place today with the new full moon studios. i yearn for the good ol' days, and truly hope, that full moon can pull itself out of this horrible slump that they're in right now.	trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10.

i must say that i wasn't impressed at all, probably because i was expecting much more from this movie. maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. so, if you expect something to think about after you see this movie, don't. it's more psychological than philosophical. i vote 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit and because i have a great respect for bbc documentaries. there are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense. it was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution, too bad that this wasn't the main subject. ah, i just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour, the movie is quite boring and in a way, cruel.

i had high hopes going to see this, as i always enjoy paul bettany's performances. i thought he was very good as darwin, and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with.darwin's book on the origin of species was one of the most ground-breaking, controversial and innovative publications ever, yet you'd never think it based on this tedious movie. it's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a victorian setting. there is virtually nothing about darwin's five-year voyage on the beagle to the galapagos islands, for example, surely of supreme significance to the story, as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolution.this is just one long, dreary, domestic drama, with darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally-constipated wife. jennifer connelly's portrayal of emma darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real emma. there could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, from either emma or from the local priest, as played by jeremy northam (a blink-and-you'd-miss-it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor) to act as a counterbalance to darwin's views, but it wasn't taken up. the story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about darwin's grief for his daughter annie, and too much time was also wasted in darwin wondering whether or not to write his book. eventually i was so bored it was difficult to care. all in all, this was a bit like making a movie about picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.

i wish i could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses. but i can't. another species could have come and mutated while i waited for some action. for such a controversial man, darwin lived the most conventional life. if you didn't know about the mad theories, you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector.the film-makers have cast darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice. even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising, it wasn't interesting to watch. maybe great thinkers are dull people? i don't know what i was expecting: a forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian, the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow? a long-haired hermit who babbled to animals? a head-cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? all of the above would have been great. this is the movies for scorsese's sake.but there was none of that. no lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe. just paul bettany and jennifer connelly fresh from the subtle as breath school of method acting. i imagine that someone with darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just pootle along - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? the disappointment is immeasurable.

the use of the term 'comedy' with relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and worse yet is the pain that is inflicted on the viewers of this production. almost nothing was funny.this documentary followed a small group of stand-up 'comics' on the road as they travel from town to town to perform in small clubs.it's interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off-stage and on-stage are indistinguishable, but sadly, equally unfunny.it's possible to understand the self delusions of grandeur which the featured 'comedians' possess, but it's harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences. perhas these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms on tv are intended.this was possibly the worst film i've ever watched in my 50+ years of movie viewing.

what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas. there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution, instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter, a ponderous script, great liberties taken with darwin's life, dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced. darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power, he may not quite rightly have believed in the established christian idea of god , but was not an atheist. which this film implies. what would have been a riveting and much better film, is if they had started with the publication of on the origin of species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed, and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides. instead we got a plodding, boring drama, mostly made up, a great injustice

i have recently become a huge fan of patton oswalt. i think he's the most deliciously original comedian to come along in ages. he is refreshing and fearless in his routines, which run the gamut of topics from how much bush sucks to the sleazy exploits of 1970s producer robert evans. i'm a longtime fan of maria bamford and her wide-eyed innocent/schizophrenic routine. whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high-pitched voice to one that is clipped and throaty, i can't help but giggle. i liked brian posehn long before i even knew he was on "just shoot me", and there is something so innately funny about his aging nerd persona. all three of these talented, unique comedians headline "the comedians of comedy", a netflix documentary about their u.s. tour. they truly deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they so richly deserve. i thought,no, i knew i'd like this movie...but i was wrong. instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments, "the comedians of comedy" is bogged down by meandering and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor, no insight, nothing of real interest. i think there is a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines total in the 109 minute movie. what a rip-off! come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars banter in their rv? where's the humor in seeing posehn in an arcade and a comic book shop? does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny? if this movie couldn't have shown our comics strutting their stuff, at least make it about what life is like on the road. it's not even about that. worst of all, the comics never appear to be having real fun. oswalt admits how bored he is doing a radio interview, posehn sheepishly admits to how much he sucks at giving a tour of his home, and bamford nervously improvises every time the camera is pointed at her, and her humor there is only sporadic.sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, amazingly crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like dane cook. instead, we have to sit through their mundane, everyday routines on the road in a substandard bore of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film. if you can locate any of oswalt's, posehn's, or bamford's performances on dvd, by all means do. their talent should be a joy to behold, not a chore like it is here.

andy milligan, the independent movie maker from new york, directs this little "treat" as his version of the sweeney todd legend. sweeney slits the throats of customers in his barbershop and his cohort mrs. lovett turns them into meat pies. thankfuly i was well-informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty. milligan, for my money, has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all-time race. ed wood looks like orson welles in comparison. this movie is so bad in oh so many ways. let's take milligan's direction for starters. the film quality is grainy. the sound quality is grainy. many scenes look as if milligan was using a camcorder to film. the credits say "photograped and directed by andy milligan." he wants to take credit for ceilings showing up after a death scene? how about the atrocious musical score selected for the film? the film cuts with one poor transition after another. little logic is used in the creation of the plot. the story has little to do with the actual legend of todd. the murder scenes are plentiful but not horrifying in any way. hands, legs, and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done: choppily! and let's take the breast in the pie scene. yes, it is in there. the pie maker didn't know that an entire breast with nipple filled an entire pie crust? later we hear from our characters that they "have been careful not to get caught" for the 200 plus murders they have done. obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep abreast of what is going on(sorry it was too tempting). the actors are not too terribly bad to be honest. some even have glimmers of talent, and all seem to be genuine english articles. many non-erotic nude scenes are forced throughout. milligan seemingly has some issues regarding sex. plot strands are left untied. the ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work. i could go on and on. did i like anything about the film? not much to be truthful. i have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick.

as i write this user-comment, tim burton's interpretation of the sweeney todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of oscar nominations if i'm not mistaken. i haven't seen it yet, but i sincerely hope burton didn't look for inspiration and/or stylish trademarks in good old andy milligan's "bloodthirsty butchers". yes, even though the title distinctively mentions butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the infamous sweeney todd) and a female baker. together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she processes the bodies into her famous london meat pies. in other words, an andy milligan premise at his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateurish. i think the imdb rating for this film speaks for itself. although the actual story definitely isn't the worst i've ever seen, milligan somehow inexplicably attracts sheer ineptitude. the production is one gigantic mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, truly hideous photography, poor lighting, lousy acting and directing, laughable gore and zilch tension or atmosphere. more than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how boring the film is, even with a running time of a mere 80 minutes. ed wood, ted v. mikels and bruno mattei; you guys need not fear as none other than andy milligan is  hands down  the worst director ever, but i don't think he cared. maybe if you dispose of a really high level of tolerance, "bloodthirsty butchers" is worth one viewing.

....is the boob in the pie. every thing else in it is an abortion, a malformed failure of a film. at least you can see and hear what goes on in an ed wood movie (usually). high schools drama clubs do better than this on a routine basis. once you've you've seen the breast pie bit, you can turn it off and go watch "hannibal".

this is awful, you just could't believe it. the score is annoying, the filming is bad, for example, sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some actors faces. the quality of the movie is ultra bad, seems like it was made in the 20ies. it's terrible. there is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the movie but always too dark filmed. no gore no effects. the director made some better one like blood rites. but out there there is a following of the man, 'cause searching to find this cheap flick isn't that hard but you have to pay hard earned cash for it. surely this will get in my top ten of worst horrormovies ever, i don't know if i would call it horror. there is too much talking, you will get bloodthirsty after watching it

the word "boring" gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low-budget horror movie might, or might not be. i've seen many a b-movie. many horrible, terribly inept b-movies. some with a production value of a few hundred bucks. does ineptness, lousy acting, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? some would no doubt way yes. most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix. well, i hate big-budget movies, so i say no. bad can sometimes be funny (blood freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (troll 2), but boring will always be unwatchable... hey, kinda like bloodthirsty butchers, which reminds me, i'm writing a review for this pile of garbage... uh, yeah, anyway. this is one of late british director andy milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. this one is based on sweeney todd... great. milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to "butcher" it. hey, that's pretty funny, i said bu... sorry, i keep getting distracted. this isn't exactly easy. on second thought, i'll make it easy. no gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people having incoherent conversations. that's bloodthirsty butchers. oh yeah, and something about a barber killing people, and something or other about meat pies. i don't know, it's not important.for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan, there's always the only other one i've seen, the rats are coming, the werewolves are here. yeah, you heard me. but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together, and pick up something sweet like sick girl or teenape goes to camp. whatever you decide, just know, bloodthirsty butchers sucks, possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale. and that, b-movie fans, is really saying something. 2/10

when i bought this film, i expected to get a fun, 1970's exploitation film. instead, i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy milligan. ah, andy milligan. with his tight editing, breakneck pacing , and wonderfully well known actors, you'd almost think you're watching...one of his home movies! seriously, i couldn't even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it. the scenes of boring people dragged on an on, and whenever someone got killed, the film would slow down. sometimes it would speed up too, making the characters voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film. the script actually seemed a bit better than the film, and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over it's lines. the cover said "their prime cuts were curiously erotic...but thoroughly brutal!" trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this film. oh, we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out, but that's about it. and as far as "brutal", well, the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film. and another thing...

you know the story of "sweeney todd" now, most likely thanks to tim burton's recent movie. you probably don't know it though, from this take on the old tale from andy milligan-that notorious sleaze merchant that gave al adamson and ted v. mikels a run for their money.it had to happen eventually. in my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60's to the 80's, i'm finally reviewing an andy milligan movie. you see, from 1964 to 1990, andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie-none of which was any good, and barely watchable. "the bloodthirsty butchers" is no exception.there is dialog and well, there is talk, and that's one of the things you will find here-lots and lots of talk. the movie reaches almost "manos the hands of fate" levels at times, as you wait tirelessly for something to happen. while i love cheap looking gore effects, the violence is too few and far between, and in spite of it's reputation, the "breast" scene isn't that shocking. i love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee, but "bloodthirsty butchers" is the kind of bad that mst3k would tear apart mercilessly. sadly, milligan would die of aids in 1991, and if there is any movie of his i'd say i sort of like, it would be the delirious "the ghastly ones." this is no "ghastly ones" though-it's just bad.

how to take charles darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick. his pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes, in one of which it is claimed he is "killing god"; pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional. and the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry. anyone who actually read "origin of species" would be vividly aware that there was no breach with god in any of darwin's work; to the contrary, there was an increased awe and respect, and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. a good movie about darwin could be educational, thoughtful, and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick. this is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes fast use of darwin's great name only as marketing clout, as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression. sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production values, except for the writing, were obviously high. see it if you want to weep, for the loss of intelligence in american literature.

i can remember reading that darwin had a pivotal experience in the galapagos islands, seeing the vast range of animal life there, and intern, penned his theory of evolution. not according to this movie-it was inspired by the british countryside. ok, and as john cleese would say-right-. i also did not think that darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish. according to this film he was. it is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but i don't think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much. well, not according to...you get the picture. i think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable, and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, which to me, is just plain gross. i think charles darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry, cool and calm, and always thinking logically. this film seeks to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration. it is like a canterbury tale. i would not recommend it.

this could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution, biology, the creative work in science, research and darwin's life, but it is not.the screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a mexican soup-opera melodrama. while it is true that darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter. he was certainly disturbed by his loss, but that did not made him literally insane, delusional and detached from his friends and family. the such portrayal of darwin is an invention of the script writer. thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about darwin's life and psyche. according to most historians, darwin had the theory ready by the end of the beagle voyage, and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data. in the movie, it is an imaginary conflict of darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public.the movie brings a modern situation, the creationists vs scientists debate, into the life and times of darwin, thus it is anachronistic. it depicts thomas huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to "kill god", in his own words from the movie, and destroy the church, who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data. huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person, a combination that i interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion. in real life, huxley accepted darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and before the work of darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. his first support of evolution was published one month after the origin of species became public. he was agnostic but did not think it was necessary "to kill god", only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. the debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie, and creationists catch-phrases such as "it is only a theory" are part of the discussion. of course, no such dispute or catch-phrases existed at that time. in fact, the anglican church published a positive review of the origin's saying that they saw god's work in evolution, in some sense, quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay.another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot. nothing could be further from the truth. the conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by darwin during five years in the hms beagle, and was developed gradually as it can be seen from darwin's notes of the voyage. even though the beagle voyage was the sole most important part of darwin's life to the conception of "origin of species", the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations. to make it worse, darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and, in the end, quits it. and i'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur.great disappointment. it is not in any way a homage to darwin and science.

man with the screaming brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the a small bulgarian town. william cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a russian cab driver yegor. the two couldn't be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. brought back to life by a mad scientist, william and yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis.bruce campbell returns to the b horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. unfortunately for this time around, the laughs don't deliver and campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film.as a fan of campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, i was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. although, after seeing this film before the purchase, i am glad that i don't have the "pleasure" of adding it.the film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. which is a sad thing to say because it was written by mr. campbell himself. the comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. it seems that campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen...him fighting himself.ted raimi, the brother of evil dead director sam raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. he brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. it helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from evil dead to xena, which is why i felt compelled to like this film.campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the tv series hercules is apparent. campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the low-budget. in the end, there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan...i won't.

the following "review" is one from the wrong side of the tracks, meaning two things: you will hear nothing but praises coming from me and don't be fooled by my rating. i also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers, but technically... that's a lie.well,... screw the review. i'm just going to ramble a bit. it has been a while since i had so much fun with such a bad film. and if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel, then you simply have no sense of humor. first off, this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and that's the main aspect were the fun is coming from. the story? a doctor's son is terminally ill. daddy-doctor decides that a hart-transplant must be the only way of saving his son. so, in true mad-doctor-style, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. of course, the gorilla-heart is "much too potent for a human", so sonny-boy transforms into this hideous ape-man that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and raping spree (because that's simply what any horny beast would do, isn't it?). the make-up of our ape-man is hilarious. there's simply no other way of putting it: the guys' face looks like a turd! i'm talking human excrement here, the solid brown kind! beautiful! the gore in this flick is wonderful too: aside from real footage of an open-heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but quite nasty) looking blood & gore effects: a decapitation, an eye-gouging, a throat-ripping, the scalping of someone's skull,... it's hilarious, and indeed it's quite incomprehensible why night of the bloody apes ever made it to the notorious uk video-nasties list, because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously. oh, and there's only one bloody ape running around in it too, by the way. so, needless to say that la horripilante bestia humana is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrong.when not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity, this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting. just a few random examples, maybe? about the sets: one can clearly see that the set-designers just used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) over and over again to be build various different interior sets (e.g.: one side of the hospital room - the window side - where the unconscious wrestling girl lies, looks suspiciously similar like the window side of the basement-laboratory from where ape-man escapes; the set-designers also took one of the side-windows from the laboratory, made it a bit larger and just placed it in the conference-room of the hospital; all the walls in any building are the same grey-ones;...). then there's the setting of the park. clearly shot in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose. whenever there's some struggling/fighting/raping going on, the grass just shifts and shuffles and you can see the grey concrete from the studio-floor beneath it.just a few random lines that come out the actors' mouths: -- in the conference-room where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl (a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital), daddy-doctor intelligently utters "we find ourselves in a situation that is difficult".-- during that same debate a colleague-doctor cleverly remarks "a sleepwalker! any sleepwalker gets up.", hereby providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl.-- after our investigating detective, through the amazing process of his own logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half man/half beast, his superior answers that it's absurd, adding the line "it's more probable that of late, more and more, you're watching on your television many of those pictures of terror"... truly one of the best lines of the movie.other sources of laughter: -- the two scenes were daddy-doctor and his igor-like assistant kidnap the gorilla from the zoo and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital - these well thought-out acts of abduction are like taking candy from a baby.-- daddy-doctor speaks to god a lot, doesn't he?-- sonny-boy calling daddy-doctor "papa" on more than one occasion.-- an old lady screaming "aaargh!!! a dead man! a dead man! a dead man!! a dead man!!!".-- the plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of women wrestling, only to go on again and do nothing with that concept. sure, daddy-doctor replaces sonny-boy's gorilla-heart a second time with that of unconscious wrestling girl, but do you think something spectacular happens after that? like ape-turd-man growing breasts or something, trying to rape men this time? our leading living wrestling beauty (norma lazareno) doesn't even go into a climactic wrestling contest with ape-turd-man near the movie's finale... but ape-turd-man does start to show some motherly love near the end... almost (and i say "almost") in true king kong-style (i.e. the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screaming).okay, i think that's enough now. i chipped in more than my two cents here. vomitron's rational rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck: 2/10. vomitron's rating from the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. go see this film, people. it is well worth it!

this is another notorious mexican horror film: however, while the original spanish-language version is quite tame, all sorts of gore and nudity were inserted for the english-dubbed variant (prepared by jerald intrator - who did similar duties on the curious dr. humpp [1967/71] - and, like the u.s. version of that film, had previously been available on dvd through something weird/image)! i watched the original first and, while no great shakes, it was fairly engaging - especially with a plot as familiar as this one was: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in attempting to save the life of his terminally ill son; he even has a hulking, game-legged assistant (played by carlos lopez moctezuma, who had essayed a strikingly similar role - though in a more sinister vein - in the curse of the crying woman [1961]). i know that several mexican films mingled horror with the "lucha libre" (wrestling) genre but i had never watched one myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are, perhaps thankfully, kept apart (that said, the wrestling sequences are competently done, with some of the moves proving highly amusing).the doctor's son is transformed into a monster (looking like the incredible hulk with mud splashed over his face!) after having had an ape's heart transplanted into him - but, then, when this is replaced with that of a comatose female wrestler, he stays this way and grows a pair of fangs to boot (shouldn't he realistically have turned into a transsexual...though i guess that wouldn't have been very interesting)!! the climactic rooftop sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and meets his demise at the hands of the police is reminiscent of the ghost of frankenstein (1942). my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film, however, occur when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he'll soon be cured - only to turn his back soon after on the verge of tears - and also the impatient look he gives his crippled assistant (as the latter staggers slowly into the car) when they're about to chase the monster who has escaped from the lab.the alternate nude scenes work for the film (these were actually done by cardona himself for a racier mexican version entitled horror y sexo) but its reputation is largely based on the added material showing over-the-top violence, such as an eyeball being gouged out of its socket, a scalping and even a person's head being torn off. there are also several graphic operation inserts which, however, give rise to a goof: while it's made clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask to the patient's face! the film is also said to be a loose remake of cardona's own black-and-white horror film doctor of doom (1962) but, since i haven't watched that one, i can't say how much of it was actually pilfered for night of the bloody apes...

lets get one thing out of the way. i am a huge bruce campbell fan, i have the evil dead series, have the action figures, and have seen bubba ho-tep. i am a fan of cheesy, laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole "it's so bad it's good" deal. i wish i could say the same about this movie. i watched this movie with high expectations, i wanted it to be good, campy, something from the bc we have all come to know and love. it started out promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes i resided to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if i had just been shot with tranquilizer darts. the idea itself isn't a bad one; two men, don't get along, both killed by the same psycho woman, half of one man's brain is transplanted into the other's head, they argue, disagree and the comedy ensues. what killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was! it had potential, even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was. the plot was boring, even bruce's zany physical slap stick couldn't make it work. word's cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that bruce's wife's brain ends up getting put into. easily the worst looking robot i have ever seen anywhere (even for a b movie.) the whole idea is dumb. what the hell was going through bruce's mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me. why ted raimi didn't go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond me.shame on you bruce!!!

i enjoy b movies. i think bruce campbell is a very watchable actor. i love how he delivers his lines. 'evil dead 2 and 'army of darkness' were great movies. i liked 'running time'. however, i don't know if i'll ever watch this movie again...and i bought it. now, after saying that, i bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching! this movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy, even as a cheapo movie. first off, ted raimi was annoying, just flat out annoying. there was nothing to his badly acted / written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before. the directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots...yikes. i don't expect woody allen or james cameron here, but campbell did not deliver.i did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an oscar movie like 'annie hall', but still i'm disappointed. i would have been happy with 'mallrats' or 'the rhino brothers'. i got much less. by the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me, no dialogue that resonated within me. even 'hostel' had a classic line for petes sake! i do not recommend this movie.

i just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening (i work for an independent theatre chain in colorado - it's one of the perks)...i'm sorry, but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen! i know that there are some bruce campbell fanatics out there who (like star wars die-hards) will string you up from the nearest tree if you dare speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon...nevertheless, campbell-teers, this particular work from the chin is a celluloid black hole.before you make any assumptions that i'm some hoity-toity film buff who only watches "real" movies like "ladies in lavender" and "sideways", think again - i'm a huge fan of b-movies, and bruce campbell in particular. his trademark character ash is one of my favorites, and his portrayal of the aging elvis in bubba ho-tep was phenomenal.but hey, b-movies still have the potential to be reeeeally, reeeeally bad (and not in that "good" campy way we all love)...and that's what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow co-workers. with the exception of that one tracking shot where bruce runs through the square and scares the kids, there were no laughs to be had. overall, we found the story to be mind-numbingly stoopid, the pacing mollasses-like, and the so-called humor dumber than a bag of hammers. (i'm sorry, but ted raimi's "pavel" character was not comic relief...he was just plain retarded!) believe me, we all went into this really wanting to like it, but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours.if you absolutely loved this movie, plan to see it multiple times, want to marry and have kids with it, etc., that's fantastic - we all like what we like, so you get no judgement from me. but don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple orgasms over campbell's latest cinematic coupe. this flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinion...and as a true campbell fan, i'm allowed to say that!

guys, what can i tell you? i'm bulgarian. i can't remember how many times i talk to americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is bulgaria, but they say things like: "there's a war going on there, right?" or "i've never imagined that in a place like bulgaria people have internet" go watch bruce campbell's "the man with the screaming brain". i was curious about this movie, cause 1) i'm bruce campbell fan - "evil dead" trilogy and "the adventures of brisco county jr." 2) the movie was shot entirely on location in bulgaria, the second after "alien apocalypse" which is also nearly unwatchable. 3) i enjoy nice b-movieswell... the movie presents our country like a never-ending gypsy town where they raid your car, wave around illegal guns, and you can get killed any moment. and bruce's line "bull$h1t bulgaria" is more than offending.ted raimi and stacy ceach make a great team, bruce does his special - beats himself up and that's all. nothing more to see here.peoeple give this movie 10 just because of bruce's cult status, but it doesn't deserve more than 3. waste of film.

while this isn't one of miss davies' very worst films, it is pretty bad. and it's sad that in a revisionist fashion, recent imdb raters have deliberately over-inflated the scores on some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the past--or so it seems. for years, conventional wisdom has been that davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau, william randolph hearst, bought her way into hollywood. this certainly is the image created in orson welles' citizen kane. it is true that hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build davies' career. with all this money, it's not surprising that she made some excellent films and it isn't surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got. sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed. however, despite this edge, she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies. after all, no rational person could believe that as of today (1/5/08), peg o' my heart and two other davies films recently shown on turner classic movies (the florodora girl and marianne) deserved the exceptionally high scores--ranking them higher than such films as high noon, ben hur, the best years of our lives and all quiet on the western front!! in fact, marianne would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to imdb with a score of 8.8!!! considering most people out there don't even know who marion davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters, this is a serious problem!! however, she was a much better actress than citizen kane implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with hearst.what sets peg o' my heart apart from these two other movies, is that marianne and the florodora girl were pleasant little films--while peg o' my heart is in some ways just terrible. much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of marion. while her french accent in marianne was cute, in peg her irish accent just sounded bizarre--not particularly irish. plus, and perhaps i'm mistaken, but her continual use of the word 'ye' makes her sound like she should be doing shakespeare, not a film set in 1933 ireland! also, there was a bizarre insistence that marion should be the consummate multi-talented star--so they had her not just act but dance and sing. the singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films, but here it seemed out of place and seriously detracted from the film. it just seemed like you could almost hear hearst shouting out "see--she is a great actress---look at her sing and dance". sadly, marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes. but for me, the biggest problem was the idea of having 36 year-old marion playing such a youthful role. it was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones mary pickford played in the teens and twenties--complete with the pig tails and plucky attitude. miss pickford could carry off these roles even though she, too, wasn't a girl any more. but here, marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30. no offense--she looked fine for her age--but she did not look like a teen! oddly, with the millions that hearts spent on marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit marion's talents. believe me, i have rated several of her films very high (i especially adore show people), but here she just couldn't help but flop--this film was a turkey.

i've watched a number of wixel pixel and sub rosa extreme movies lately, and have found a lot to like about them.this sre movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others i've seen. perhaps that's because this is a comedy/horror movie rather than straight horror, and perhaps it's also because the humor didn't register with me very well.it's a little less than seventy minutes long, and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning. there are some outtakes, goofs, and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll.sre movies do tend to be short, and tend to feel padded out in spite of that. this is no exception, with some scenes that tend to go on too long.the story involves a poor kid in christmastown, california who'd been picked on by all his classmates. he'd had one shoe stolen, and unable to replace it, he was dubbed "oneshoe mcgroo." due to an obsession with pirates, his parents gave him an eyepatch for christmas with a christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch.many of the classmates are killed, and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do. they're picked off one by one by mcgroo, who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing.the characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes, like the nerd named dorkus, etc. there's an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head. this reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director rinse dream.the picture quality is good, and there are a lot of extras. but basically a pretty silly movie.oh well, i guess you can never have too many christmas horror movies. still, there are a lot of other needy holidays.

first off, i saw another reviewer said this movie was "fantastic". well nothing could be further from the truth! this movie is complete garbage!!! a moronic horror comedy that is not even slightly funny!! don't take that mean that it's so bad that it's good because it's not. it's a total waste of time and money!here's what i see in this waste of a dvd. a group of friends get together on a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video. they grab mom and dad's video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot. they all get a big kick out of watching themselves mug for the camera. they figure, if they think it's funny then everyone will think it's funny. well, they're wrong. this backyard home video is garbage. the "acting" and comedic gore effects are lousy but i guess that's to be expected since this is nothing more then a home video.on the bright side, i guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie. if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone can!0/10-- save your money.

my brain was screaming "why do you keep watching! turn it off and go to bed!" but couch potatoness won out, and i watched until the predictable ending. i guess when it's bruce campbell i need to give it a chance.i find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget... time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. ted and bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.it's sad, too, because bruce has always been a favorite. after the 70's and 80's, i just can't believe movies this bad are still being made. bruce, i'm really disappointed.

my review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: 1. plants eating people have been done hundreds of times. it's been used by nintendo in everything from mario to zelda to metroid prime. it's been used in plenty of low-budget 50's movies, on par with the lowest of the godzilla franchise. and this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that talk. i've known no one who walked out, but i know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie. i was one of them. doesn't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap? 2. the characters easily could have been copy/pasted from hostel or wrong turn or wolf creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck. yet it's called "characterizing" when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clichés that hundreds of characters before have had? don't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs? 3. this was not gory. a guy cuts his skin off. oh, my! (not.) a guy gets his legs broken. oh my! gasp! (not.) i have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said: "i've seen pg movies worse than that! why was it rated r?" so, why was it rated r? 4. here's the only plot the movie/book has: collage kids drink, have sex, get naked, cruse, bleed, and eventually die. this is possibly the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror movie, yet people call this "mature"? what the . . .? 5. i do not think i have ever seen something less original sense i watched a beautiful mind. haven't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre out there, would do something . . . well, diverse? something truly original?i just wish more horror movies would have actual horror, not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around.1/10

i'm 35. bruce was the man in evil dead, and i still love to watch ed1 and ed2. it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in bubba ho tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for bruce's early fans. either i'm getting too old for this sh17, or i'm just not part of bruce's target audience anymore. i'm positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film. but this over extended matinée sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments, and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor. campbell better talk seriously with sam raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest. at least there would be a good director behind the camera... sorry bruce, this just doesn't cut it for me. take care.

written by, directed by and starring the champ of camp bruce campbell. easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in bulgaria. all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny. campbell plays an affluent american business man with a cheating wife(antoinette byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. he hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on' with the taxi driver. within moments of campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. a mad scientist(stacy keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the american's head. with massive stitches on his forehead, campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. thus, bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. i get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. rounding out the cast are ted raimi, tamara gorski, and vladmir kolev. watch for this on the sci-fi channel.

as a bruce campbell fan for nearly two decades, i was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. unfortunately, "man with the screaming brain" was itself a disappointment.set in bulgaria--where the sci-fi channel makes its saturday night original films--"man with the screaming brain" is a curious mix of '50s b-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. if that doesn't make sense, well, neither does "man with the screaming brain." campbell plays a pharmaceutical company ceo who visits bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former communist country's half-finished subway system. the two fall in with a former kgb agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman.a local scientist (stacy keach) and his goofy assistant (ted raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into campbell's damaged skull. also, they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand.campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body--echoing in his head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (his robot wife does the same.) but first, there's an attempt to emulate steve martin/lily tomlin's "all of me" when campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. just as he was playing his own evil hand in "evil dead ii," campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind.at times, "screaming" comes closest to another steve martin film, "the man with two brains," as it also takes a silly approach to '50s sci-fi clichés. however, it tries too hard for too little result, and that goes double for ted raimi's semi-comprehensible bulgarian oaf, who gets entirely too much screen time. (nothing against raimi, it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) in the end, it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a b-movie pastiche. i was glad that campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt, as i feared having to say, "gee, bruce, that was really...something."perhaps the best praise i can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. and it was twice as good as "alien apocalypse."

it's so fake! the plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film. the common themes of blaxploitation like racism, oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined so simplistically/shallowly. and the jokes aren't even funny! dolemite does these stand up monologue comedy routines that are really painful. all the people around him deliver this canned laughter. even the soundtrack sounds like it's fakin' the funk. for far better comedy in a blaxploitation try "coffy" & "friday foster" with pam grier. for a more realistic blax experience try "black heat".

i love the so-called "blaxploitation" films and have seen dozens. some, such as cotton comes to harlem, shaft and hammer have excellent production values and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and silly, but still entertaining, such as brotherhood of death or coffey. however, dolemite manages something rare for the genre--it's just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining! it's like blaxploitation made for very, very stupid people.years ago, i saw a takeoff on the dolemite films on "mad tv" and unfortunately, the real dolemite isn't any better. like the parody, the acting is just atrocious. rudy ray moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. he can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke--with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again. as for the rest of the actors, many might be even worse. my favorite was the fbi guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out--yet they didn't even bother to re-film these scenes! in fact, so much of it was inept that i had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a joke.if you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film, you're wrong. even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin, will be disappointed. the naked women in the film really do look like hard-luck prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies. i think looking at old people naked--reeeaally old people naked--is no worse than looking at these "ladies". and as for rudy ray, he has "man boobs". no black super-hero or anti-hero should look that bad naked!! for goodness sakes, put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written by winos!!!fyi--apparently, there are actually sequels to this film!! i can't imagine watching them, so you'll just have to find someone else to review them. i have watched plan 9 from outer space, teenagers from outer space and robot monster, but i just don't think i can bring myself to see another dolemite film--they are that bad!

"dolemite" is the touching story of dolemite (gotta love blaxploitation film titles), an ex-con who probably should still be in jail. he gets in trouble with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes, and society in general. he's just not that likable a guy. neither is the movie, though it's still hilarious and worth watching.the flimsy premise is that dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star rudy ray moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit. when a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down, the warden releases him to stop it, or help it, or just watch it. not very clear. all i know is that i was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence. my ignorance, i guess.the plot is convoluted and unimportant, basically dolemite goes around killing people (usually with very poorly choreographed karate), having sex, and cursing out people, sometimes even rhyming too. the joys of the movie are its total incompetence, and its total indifference in the matter.i stopped counting the number of times i saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). i stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where dolemite was sitting, even after he stood up and walked around, when they cut back to the establishing shot and dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again. i stopped wondering why dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change, because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him. and i stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open. the only time i was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting, flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up. you keep saying "cut away...cut away...cut away" but by the time they do, you are already emotionally scarred.the movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable. moore as dolemite, is either funny, cool, or both. if you're on the lookout for a bad movie, you have found it with "dolemite."

actually, i am not narrating the main plot in this comment but with just 2-3 sentences i can make it a spoiler. ok here are these- speed is just a 85% conversion of hollywood flick cellular into bollywood by using the software vikram bhatt. title has no match with the story, only it goes in the thriller direction. just that!! it doesn't deserve even a single star for its imitation, imperfect casting, poor standard and predictable story. undoubtedly now i can say that viram bhatt is slowly vanishing away from his director status as no any matured audience will appreciate his recent works including this. beside him, aftab shivdasani too making his outlook as cartoon-comic type. who knows how long will he last in the film industry more? sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a c-grade movie. but most supportive role was played by zayed khan which was somewhat identical with chris evan's role as ryan in cellular. with innocent face sanjay suri has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress. that's why those who have already watched cellular i advise you never to waste your time again with this imitation sack.

i happened to catch this on tv, and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based. i was very disappointed. first, if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it's not exactly an a-list production. gregory hines was a world class dancer, but sadly not a great actor.in fact, all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy, which can only be blamed on the director, who is this film's weakest link. charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stone's "jfk" in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the "real" child murderer(s), but without the benefit of a good script, an a-list cast or, it must be said, the talent. it just doesn't work.it's a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment.

what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of 'originality'. this film does not contain one innovating element. if, by 'originality' you refer to pathetic action scenes, overacting, gluttony in violence, blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. then, 'originality' is something swedish film can do without.how röse and karlsson can agree to 'act' in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me. and how eva röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-tv promoting it just disappoints me.this film doesn't contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just plain bad. these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy-fantasy containing violence, comic-strips and trivialized psychological portraits. i wouldn't be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a micro-wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors.i wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.

and it's only january, still i'm sure of it!by far this is among the worst swedish movies i've ever seen and to be honest swedish movies ain't that good in general. it have been claimed to be "original" and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a english speaking movie, for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can't help but to feel like måns mårlind and björn stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one swedish package. what can i say the outcome can just be...poor. first of all the story is just weak to begin with, even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories - first a failed try to make swedish action á la matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story. and if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the "cool stuff" that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that sweden also can do hollywood movies - which we can't nor should try to. for example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about "storm" while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness - really i don't think even stein or mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie, more than just trying to show off poor extra effects. for the actors, i've got to admit eric ericson does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through, even tough storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of dd he does not change one bit in his way of acting. jonas karlsson, well to be honest i thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by storm... really he just have to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. lastly eva röse is just beyond critic, both her character and her acting. the only reasons storm succeeds of not getting a 1/10 is for eric ericson and, what can i say, at least it tries..

and also a wonderful beginning, a real quick start. it keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come. unfortunately the high adrenaline dries off quickly, but most certainly after half the movie is over.and it's a shame, because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly. but that is also one of it's faults. by exploring too many things, it get's mixed up into to many things, so in the end you're too confused to follow any plot or characters. it's very dark and moody, but that doesn't help much, if it's also genre hopping just to try to fit any- and everything in it's story!

i was subjected to this terrible excuse for a made for tv movie. i only watched it because i don't have cable and my only other choices were golf, college basketball, or local news. the plot is very generic and has no substance that i could see, not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes. the main character, dr. sorensen, is a washed up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named "nemesis" will strike earth, causing all life to cease. he bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an aboriginee (i'm sure i spelled that one wrong). the paintings show an apparent timeline, showing significant events throughout history, such as the building of the great wall of china. all of the events are shown in perfect chronological order, and the very last picture on the timeline is earth being destroyed. now to me, if the painting showed things that had indeed happened, why would the great doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen? all that aside, the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision. there was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. the actors were not very good, and on a few occasions i just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about. the whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money. i'd recommend armageddon over this piece of crap any day. at least armageddon has some good acting (compared to this), not to mention the eye candy that is liv tyler. now that i think about it, golf isn't that bad.......

this is better than the early cronenberg horror films, but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story. the videogame theme has been told before too. nothing original is left except the weird cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and shore's dark score. the story never grabs your full attention. it just flows forward event after event with boring pace. rating 4/10.

we don't know if darlene loves all three gentleman, certainly they are wary of one another, yet they live together. viewers might surmise that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward darlene might make for an unbearable home life.in the eerily beautiful rural brazilian landscape (emphasized by the frequent use of polarization and the use of kodachrome stock), anything might happen, and the alternatives for any one of them. save perhaps ciro, may not be alluring enough to encourage them to change their circumstances. they seem to bear the intolerable because it is familiar-the unknown frightens them into complacency toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can utilize. thus it crushes them, rather than strengthening them. the web in which they are caught is made of the sanguine filaments which bind us all. perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with it's portrayal of the inevitable fading of our youth's bright colors in the unforgiving light of time. the three children will enter the world fated to relive their parents lives to one or another degree. well filmed and portrayed, the story is tragic in it's essence. walt disney it ain't

i have to say that this movie was really quite awful. the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography.i found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the cliché lines did nothing for me. the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and did'nt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie. the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary. the ending wasn't satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didn't make me feel anything for the characters. this movie was boring and did nothing for me, i recommend this movie to no one.

this 22 minute short, short of a precursor to the later much better "rock and rule", features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere. the female mouse, jan, signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star. so it's up to daniel mouse to save her soul. made in the late '70's this has all the trappings of said decade (crap music, crap clothing and hair style, awful folk tunes) this cartoon is featured on the second disc of the 2-disk collector's edition of "rock and rule", it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself.my grade: d+

this film was reeeeeeallyyyy bad! was it meant to be a comedy as i couldn't help laughing the whole way through it? what a waste of two hours! donald sutherland was wooden not that he was alone, everyone else was just as bad...and how miscast was linda hamilton???

okul"the school" is a result of a new trend in turkish cinema. having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. of course, it doesn't mean that they are all grand. i think okul is one of them. it is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. it is not successful on being scary either. so what is it? actors are so average especially deniz akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. i am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa. but directors have missed the target this time. ** out of *****

i clicked onto the encore mystery channel to wait for the movie i wanted to see, island of dr. moreau. i caught only a few minutes of shadow conspiracy. an old man runs to meet charlie and grabs him by the arm. suddenly, an assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head (with a side arm) from across the street. after waiting for "c" to turn around and look, the "a" tries to shoot "c" and clearly misses. "c" was a much easier target, the old man couldn't have run far. duh! there is a chase and "c" is on an elevator "a" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable, which is parallel to the "a". he hits and severs the cable, impossible. later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "a" lines up on "c" from maybe 50 meters, but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead. how does charlie get his parts? does daddy go to the producers and say "look, my kid needs work..." it reminds me of his stupid sit - com. all the actors are good except, yup ... you got it. i usually have to endue 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for c.s.i. to come on. let's see, what can i do for the next hour. i know, i'll trim my toenails! much better use of my time.

i would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately i can't. who can write so bad scripts (i saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be sutherland - needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in redford's movie, "ordinary people" and others ! -).though i don't like it, but i had no choice, i saw the movie in french, but i know that hearing the real voices of sheen, sutherland and hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful.what makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff (i forgot to speak about mr waterson, far away from the woody allen's movies he once used to play in).we had another movie on another french channel : a silly james bond with brosnan (i am not talking about the real bonds with connery(please it's the end of holidays, wake up !).

funny thing. charlie sheen, donald sutherland, sam waterston, and stephen lang have all had incredible performances. who can forget sheen as the callow naif in wall street, or sutherland as the the cynical korean war surgeon in mash? waterston and lang have both also had successful tv and film careers (law and order, killing fields, de niro's tribeca, etc). so what in the world would any of these fine actors be doing in a stink bomb like this?shadow conspiracy's plot of a washington coup d'etat is not really that bad, unoriginal maybe but not that bad. sure it's been done (seven days in may - a fine film!), but with a little tweaking, it could still have been entertaining. shadow conspiracy's main problem is in the execution. early in the film sheen, political strategist extreme, ridiculously and implausibly resolves a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing a congressman. later, gunplay with lang's mute hitman tearing up half of what is supposed to be georgetown is explained on the news as "gang wars". has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in washington? sheen is about 20 years too young, way way too young, to be so senior in a white house administration. sheen's response to avert a political crisis is so ladened with false machismo, he looks as though he attended the david hasselhoff school of acting. and when was the last time gang wars spread to georgetown? we're talking about a section of washington where citizens voted against having a metro stop so that they could maintain their exclusivity.i agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. i taped it off hbo a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to plod through it.in summary: don't buy this film. don't even rent this film. if you see it at blockbuster, run away as fast as you can.

would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy? no? how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet. what? you don't believe me? ... ok. yes, i made that up. it's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time - another movie equaled more money - as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton ... why? don't even get me started on stephen lang. he was so much fun as the party crasher in 'the hard way' and now this junk.ah no matter. everyone involved should feel ashamed. if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed - it's twisted - but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here. flat out, the story stinks and we're actually supposed to take this yak seriously. makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope. seriously, i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me. maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it's way to theaters!?oh ... sam waterson, how great you are in law & order. why are you here? demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin. then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p. cosmatos who's "directing" credits include rambo: first blood part ii amongst other gems. hmm.... case in point?

rarely have i seen an action/suspense movie that was so boring. none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad. charlie sheen (platoon, major league) stars as the white house chief of staff, who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead. donald sutherland (a time to kill, fallen) plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton (linda hamilton, terminator, dante's peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. charlie sheen is ok as the star, donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. linda hamilton gives a poor performance. with a bad movie, i can actually like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff.

i still wonder why i sat through this entire thing. it only had about 3 minutes of actual entertainment, the rest of it was just a total bore. the acting isn't that great and the action scenes are soooo cheesy it's not even funny. i kinda wish i could say something good about this film but i can't think of anything right now. there probably was somethings in it some can enjoy but the ending of it is gotta be the dumbest idea ever. what type of person would get a little toy remote controlled helicopter with a burned in machine gun in it to assassinate the president? this idea could have never been done in the first place let alone have anyone dumb enough to try it, i guess the writer must have been to obsessed with the toy car scene in the dead pool but actually tried to make this look serious.

this film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc.i couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by hamilton and sheen - but then i really wouldn't have to. risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains. still, if my life was flashing before my eyes, i think i would fast forward this 90 minutes.i have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears. i made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again.

this all looked quite promising. an up-and-coming presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house. it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors. yet very few people have a good word to say about it.the whole thing really needed some depth. you can pick up the idea that the president is being too left-wing with his ideas, and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out. conrad appears to simply want the country to be governed his way, rather than the way of the elected leader.however, the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard assassination method - and linda hamilton's character is completely uninspired. her 'the president's my father' 'diversion' was ludicrous - that would make the president about 10 when that happened. worse still was her predictable final scene with bishop.they could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either bottled it or failed. they could've gone to town on special effects, but the good ones were wasted. they could have achieved so much more in general. this was barely worth the £1 it cost me.

my take: routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. a rarely seen political thriller, which made a very poor box-office response, i managed to catch the shadow conspiracy on tv just now, and while i was glad that i satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film, i didn't exactly feel this film was all special. considering the box-office response to it, shadow conspiracy is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it, but still ain't very good to begin with and everything, from script to direction, is pretty predictable. charlie sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases (a lot of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the white house staff. after a professor is murdered, sheen aids the help of ex-flame reporter amanda givens (linda hamilton) to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. but this script, written by adi hasak & ric gibbs, are pedestrian as they come, not much differing from other white house conspiracy thrillers as in absolute power and murder at 1600. some considerable talents (donald sutherland, ben gazzara and stephen lang) try their best on a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter, which seems far too silly and out-of-place in this "serious" political thriller. the shadow conspiracy has its moments i'm sure, some of which are much to under-appreciated (director george pan cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes), but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises. rating: ** out of 5.

this film is bad. it's filled with glaring plot holes, characters who are ruled by stupidity, bad acting and above all, a poor script which has been done before in many, many films, only better. i feel sorry for donald sutherland, i just hope he had to do this film rather than wanted to! miss it.

i was not expecting a classic, but at least a funny film. there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more. you don't scare it is full of american teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily.but it tells much about a senior student in a turkish high-school. pressure of student selection exam (oss) that 3-hour-exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration. the movie is bad. don't waste your time to watch it.

this movie is filled with so many idiotic moments, that you wonder how it ever got made. for example, they get into the sewers from the capitol and while they're in the sewers you can see signs pointing to various government buildings, and then they come up in the middle of the street! i highly doubt that government buildings would provide public access through the city sewer system. anyways, i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value. i laughed the whole way through at the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie.

1st watched 2/25/2002 - 4 out of 10(dir-george p. cosmatos): predictable action thriller where any frequent movie goer could guess what was coming next. charlie sheen is the good old boy to the president who just happens to be not liked by the rest of the presidential staff. of course, he gets involved in a situation where he's framed over and over again and he has one friend in the white house, played by sutherland, who naturally doesn't stay that way for very long. his other friend is a reporter played by linda hamilton(who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role), and of course his biggest and bestest friend is the president himself(sam waterston) who stays his pal till the end despite everyone else being killed around him. brainless yet action-packed meaningless trife despite loads and loads of acting talent(all pretty much wasted.)

they make everything too easy in this film. it sort of reminded me of indiana jones where he hides on the outside of a submarine during an ocean crossing. everybody knows everything that's going on, it's just real easy to get anyplace you want in the white house. i don't even know why i watched half of it. because i like charlie sheen and donald sutherland. i expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from every angle, and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually it's faster than a car in a garage or a allyway). it was silly, mostly, and i didn't even know then had a ten-story elevator in the white house. anyway, anything conspiratorial is always interesting.

mst3k fodder. it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason. there are some hilarious things in it, such as the mysterious device the bad guy is seen working on for the whole movie, that turns out to be this tiny helicopter that flutters around carrying and firing a machine gun without so much as a wobble, but is brought down by a bag of balloons (the kind they release at political conventions). many other wonderful touches of that sort. stars charlie sheen. there's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation, only to drop the microcassette in the potomac river by accident. if they'd cast emilio estevez in the part that never would've happened.

i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area. the cast showed promise but when i saw the director, george cosmotos, i became suspicious. and sure enough, it was every bit as bad, every bit as pointless and stupid as every george cosmotos movie i ever saw. he's like a stupid man's michael bey--with all the awfulness that accolade promises.there's no point to the conspiracy, no burning issues that urge the conspirators on. we are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next. thus, the current budget crisis, the war in iraq, islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million americans without health care, stagnating wages, and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti.a truly, stunningly idiotic film.

this movie is not worth seeing, at least not at a cinema. the story is hard to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier). it's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad/weird that it sometimes seems like it. american sirens and lights on swedish police cars is just one example. the acting of persbrandt and bergqvist is good as usual, but i think jenny lampa acting as jasmin acts very poor. zara zetterqvist acts pretty well, she's not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time. if you still want to see it, wait until it's released on dvd or is shown on tv.

this movie features several well known actors which i usually like, so i had at least modest expectations when i rented this on dvd. i was highly disappointed. in fact i walked off for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow i ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the tv. the actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the atmospheres in the movie felt very convincing. virtually all scenes had that "just a movie" feeling to them, i just sat there waiting to hear the director calling "cut!" followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the next.since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and mob-like, the problem here is just that this whole bad-boy attitude is played out so poorly that it just feels like a joke. the constant guitar-drilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere too, but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already strong feeling of the whole thing just being fake.maybe it was just a really really bad script, maybe it was just poorly executed. i'm no movie critic, in fact i consider it rare to see something that's really good, but this was just plain bad no matter how objective and forgiving i'm trying to be. not recommended, not even as a rental!

this short was director del lord's last and only shemp short. the problem: it was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a curly short "busy buddies" (1944). the interrogation scene was pretty funny, and the beginning part of the cafe part. but there are a lot of plotholes in this short. for example, why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come? in the remake, "of cash and hash"(1955), director jules white fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers. the scene in which moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with curly in "dutiful but dumb" (1941). the spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house. to top it off, the ending had no sting to it. rating: c-

contains spoilersbut if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made. centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but wait for it, then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime, therefore being "drawn by pain", so clever. the story itself is actually ok, but it's just how it's done, jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man, while her dad, who sports a great moustache, just walks around the house all day while looking angry, just showing how bad the characterisation is, especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase "no more" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface. the following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant, including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion. the episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes, but oh no jesse doesn't want this. little jesse, is shitting out post modernism as if he'd just eaten donnie darko and then douched himself to death. pointless camera jerks, all at weird angles, overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes. in conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done, also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great, i just wanna hug his lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft. the character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another. but all in all, mainly s**tindiana jones 4 however is much better, type "jeeharv" into you-tube as well, the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes, mostly gay ones.

first of all, the genre of this movie isn't comedy, it's more of a drama.i had low expectations on the movie, and still they didn't come up them. as some of the other reviews point out, there are some nice music in the movie. but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon jovi, or mötley crue, it'll be more quality time.last, if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, i recommend "almost famous".

when underdog the cartoon debuted in 1964, at the age of 7 i was hooked immediately. he was top dog (pun intended) in my book-(that is, until batman premiered on abc a year or so later). even when it was clear that disney was going to make a live-action version of the once popular saturday morning cartoon, it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of crap. even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this. however, i made it a point to: a) never attempt to write a review unless i have seen the movie from start to finish; and b) never to spend one red cent on a movie that i'm almost certain i will hate.thanks to youtube i: a) am fully qualified to write this review; and b) it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard earned time.it also proves my point, namely, that this movie is not merely a piece of crap. it's a steaming pile of dog droppings. it resembles the tv series in name only, even though they almost got it right with simon and cad.all in all, underdog is a huge waste of time- and money, which thankfully, i didn't have to spend.rating: 1/2* out of *****

let me start of by saying that i never wanted to see this movie in the first place; i had to watch it one day, and i figured that i guess i can lighten up and enjoy it for what it is, and it might turn out to be entertaining. what i got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies i have ever seen, bar none. first of all, there was nothing humorous in the least bit. the creators expected humor to be laughable/passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of underdog's mouth and use scene after scene of bland, played out aspects to "charm" the audiences light-hearted side, while still making them "ooh" and "ah" for more with boring action scenes and insipid, lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it. the acting was dull, the humor was tedious and the characters/plot felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors/actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of depth. this movie is plain and simply awful in every field and really only kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it, which even though that's what age range it was aimed at, that does not excuse it for being so poorly daft and causing me to feel so penitent. parents, spend your money on up, wall-e, the spiderwick chronicles, the water horse or hotel for dogs for the best, recent family/kids flicks, or even alvin and the chipmunks is better than this filth!

they did it again: ripped off an old show's title, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring "re-imagined" stuff. the '60's cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of super hero comic books. the character was drawn as 1/2 way between animal and human, the way mickey mouse is. here they use a real beagle; that's about the same as making a mickey mouse watch with a real rat. most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film. instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog who's even dumber than cad. and some pet owners who add nothing to the story. cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). poor scripting. a stereotyped dwarf playing simon bar sinister. the gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice underdog is painful. you'd think they'd at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate wally cox's humorously distinctive voice for underdog. but no. there are, at least, a few affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines), which lift it to a 4. only small children that love dogs may enjoy this. everybody else should get a dvd of the original cartoon series. watch this only in desperation.

when i first became a father about 5.5 years ago, i was prepared for many of the sacrifices i'd have to make. i knew i'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade, but i wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night. this, in my humble opinion, is cruel and unusual punishment.underdog is bad. it's not quite karate dog bad, but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction. if underdog were a television show, i'd recommend flipping on by. not even the presence of puddy and the voice of banky edwards can save it. bow. wow.it was also just about the best 80 minutes i've ever enjoyed. james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left, and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking, flying mutt than watching the screen. at 5 and 3 years old, they were the target audience, and this movie nailed the target. there's a scene where underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. when underdog was flying into outer space, james was literally at the edge of his seat, mesmerized. the kids absolutely loved underdog, and that's why i was there. that's what last night was all about.unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten, you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film. but if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old, i won't judge. i had a blast.

this is the worst movie i've ever seen. boring, illogical, terrible. don't waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap! i hope the directors won't make any other movie because this movie bankrupts them. the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors (if we can use this word for these 2 guys). they use only camera in hand. many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen. lots of scenes (80% of the movie) are with conversation only. ! there are movies like vampire vs. zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad, no point to making such movies. please, stop jason horton and shannon hubbel. don't make more movies!

rise of the undead starts as some huge nuclear type blast rips through an unnamed american city, a few people survive in a building by leaning on the door so it'll stay closed & keep the nastiness out(!). they argue amongst themselves for ages, then a monster thing arrives from seemingly nowhere & begins to kill them of one-by-one...written, produced & directed by jason horton & shannon hubbell one has to say rise of the undead is terrible. the script takes itself very seriously but makes little sense, the first thing i asked myself was if there's this huge nuclear blast type thing going on outside destroying the entire city why are these people i'm watching still alive? why is the building they are in still standing? then i asked myself when was something actually going to happen, the entire first 20 minutes is set in one room, actually that's a bit generous it's more of a corridor as the main character's argue. then it turns into some return of the living dead (1985) rip-off with a government created virus which turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt, pointless & seemingly random plot twists i've ever witnessed which renders most of what has just happened a complete waste of time. then for the final 30 odd minutes rise of the undead turns into some strange sci-fi type thing as something which resembles a ball of energy floats around killing everyone, was i the only asking what this floating ball of energy thing is & where it came from? getting back to what was happening outside what was the reason again? oh that's right we are never told. rise of the undead is a mess, the character's are awful & aren't even given names, the twist about halfway through will have you tearing your hair out in frustration, the dialogue sucks, nothing is explained & there's virtually no story here. the final 10 minutes (maybe a bit more) of rise of the undead features no dialogue whatsoever & the film just suddenly ends.director's horton & hubbell were obviously working on a low budget, the entire film is set in about two rooms & three corridors! the photography is awful, they use annoying colour filters seemingly at random & sometimes it really does look like rise of the undead was shot on a camcorder. there's no special effects, there's some fake blood splashed around but no actual make-up effects to speak of. there are some cgi shots of the city being engulfed in flames which look alright but the floating ball of energy creature thing looks terrible. there is one baffling shot early on where two people are sitting against a corridor wall & talking, for some bizarre reason their heads are cut off at the top of the screen! just their lower bodies from the neck down are seen yet nothing else is happening in frame, they are not moving & there's no else there but for some strange reason their heads are cut off the top of the frame as they talk to each other! it's quite an odd thing to watch actually.with an ultra low budget of about $10,000 & according to the imdb shot in two weeks i have to congratulate the makers for getting rise of the undead finished & distributed but that's where my congratulations stop because otherwise this has awful production values & is set in about three corridors which are located somewhere in new orleans in louisiana as that's where rise of the undead was shot. the acting sucks so i won't dwell on it.rise of the undead sucks, it sounds like a zombie film but in all honestly it isn't, everything about it is sub par & i know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but that's not really an excuse as far as i'm concerned. definitely not recommended.

with the terrible acting, the awful dialog, the multitude of bad humor, the crappy plot and over terrible film. this has to be the worst film i have ever viewed in my life, and i'm the king of finding bad movies. for the effects, they just threw fake blood on people and things, didn't spend the time to create wounds and make special effects worth anything. most people making low budget horror flicks at least do something like clads of tissue or something to make a gashing wound. the dialog was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort. they just threw some actors on a set and said, have at it. i swear i've seen better films from my film i class at school. how did this ever get a dvd release?

i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this. it seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore. it follows ashton kutsher through survival swimmer school, guided by master chief kevin costner, then to alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last resulting in death.i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast guardsmen ("puddle pirates"). the experienced old timer costner who is, as an elderly bar tender tells him, "married to the coast guard." the older chief who "keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen." the neglected ex wife ashore to whom kostner pays a farewell visit. the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a loftier goal. the gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past.the problem is that we've seen it all before. if it's kevin costner here, it's clint eastwood or john wayne or lou gosset jr. or vigo mortenson or robert deniro elsewhere. and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from "the perfect storm" and "dead calm." none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality.it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of instruction. it's mostly personal conflict, romance, and tension about washing out.it's a shame because the u. s. coast guard is rather a noble outfit, its official mission being "the safety of lives and property at sea." in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles. in world war ii, the coast guard even managed to have a medal of honor winner in its ranks.but, again, we don't learn much about that. we don't really learn much about anything. the film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else. a disappointment.

if one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now it has been done. judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well. i cannot remember one funny scene though i have to admit, i had to turn it off before it was finished. i did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well. if you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper, stick your head in a pile of manure and breath deeply.

i am not so old that i can't remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times. but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells.from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead. neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades. if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years ago...this movie is worse. it was not even funny by accident it is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. may goldthwaits' hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script. strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood

bobcat goldthwait should be commended for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film, a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything. melinda hamilton stars as amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark. she struggles with telling her fiancé, john. of course the truth does rear it's shaggy ugly head. the film deals with the fallout of said escapade. the movie is well-acted by all, save for perhaps jack plotnick as dougie, who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture. and the film while solid enough seems to miss it's mark a few times. every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our a tad hard to relate to. bobcat should be commended for doing something different, as i said before, but different does not always equal good and this pales ever so slightly not to goldthwaits own directorial debut, the criminally misunderstood "shakes the clown"my grade: c-

not a bad concept.i just wish they had taken it in another direction. its a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality to begin with, which works for most people(prudes with weak stomachs).but besides this there's not much to this movie. its not funny nor is it romantic so please somebody change that label , and since i already knew that bestiality is actually legal most places and a million dollar industry, i wasn't really shocked. but most people do not know this and i thought that how the movie evolved after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye opener movies that would teach the ignorant about a fetish that is very much a reality for(yes i did my homework)hundreds of thousands of people.so if you like watching bad movies that you can daydream about how you could make them better while watching them than sure,have fun doing that.

this film is totally unbelievable. the only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress. yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise 'normal' healthy female just got a bit bored and 'made a little mistake' and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. what's more it never had any detrimental affect on her ever again except when she tells someone.not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldn't resist - she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice. she wasn't on drugs or anything she just 'felt like it'.the rest of the film seeks to put this action in a light of 'hey it could happen to anyone she's only being honest'.but really for this to be believed we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely anything if she 'just feels like it'. think about it - could she have considered the rights and wrongs of this action before carrying it out? if she had she would have stopped in her tracks. human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons. if we are now to start considering bestiality as a 'cute' little aberration, what is next? child abuse? yet the 'heroine' is portrayed as a hard done by, nice girl who had one moment of aberration. if she had been forced to carry out this act by an abuser - the story might have made more sense and i would have been able to accept the storyline. but there is no way that anyone carries out the prolonged activity required and referred to even once - if there is not some deep, disturbance that requires a great deal of psychiatric help. this is no way a one off happening in an otherwise perfect life.i know this is just a film, but it is through normalising behaviour such as this via the media that society becomes desensitised and more and more awful realities become possible.i could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade them that it isn't such a big deal and then moving on with their agenda. it could also be used by an abuser to underline to a child not to tell about the abuse - because look how people will react to you if you do.this is not about truth. the director wants people to think it's about truth. this is about degradation and how easily people (the viewing public)can be manipulated into accepting the most appalling concepts if wrapped up in the right way. the watching public are being manipulated, degraded and laughed at.this is a film in which the actors and the viewers are being humiliated and made fools of in a very sophisticated way by a clever but extremely disturbed film writer.this film appears to me to be being used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get off on the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner. i don't know whether it is conscious on their part - but it is the most classic example of mind f***k that i have ever encountered.i hope that this doesn't offend anyone too much. but if you watched this film - i don't think there is any room left to be offended by anything any more.

reading through most of the other reviews, i tend to agree with most of the comments. the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced. i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual (sometimes jerky) camera angles, and flitting from one scene to another. it goes down well with these movie festivals, and with some of these indie type critics, but it spoils the movie for me. i noticed in the reviews, one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters. this would maybe prove my point, as the film has that 'rushed to finish' feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow. as for the comment about kiefer sutherland being a big name to put on the poster, i would bet he cringed when watching the final cut. this is a story with real potential, spoilt by trying to be different in it's production. worth watching, but not many would come back for a second view.

set in the mid 1800's when the british is clearing new zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. the daughter of a british army surgeon, sarah(samantha morton), falls in love with the son of one of the maori leaders. the maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the europeans to deal with. by the time sarah's child, which she calls "boy", is born, his father is dead. by the age of six, "boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and sarah will begin her search for him with a man(kiefer sutherland),who is deeply in love with her.two-time oscar nominee morton is definitely the star of this movie. sutherland is a total waste. also starring are: cliff curtis, stephen rea, temuera morrison and david rawiri pene. this movie is rated r for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. i find the title river queen very misleading and the dvd cover with sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime.

as the above suggests, i was ultimately unimpressed with this movie. it is lovely to look at, the scenery is lush, but the detail of the story, in particular the characters, are totally unbelievable. films don't have to be believable, but films like this, with a political edge and social commentary do. similarly, i have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again, films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw. this is absolutely the case with sutherland, who is frankly rubbish as doyle. his accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and we end up with a caricature of irishness with no personality outside of his nationality. i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. all in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be the mission, this kind of thing wrecks your chances of success.speaking of accents, there were a couple more problems, one being the striking modernity of boy's accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time. more surprising was samantha morton's much lauded irish accent, which was variable to say the least. her voice meandered between strong north and soft south, even in the voice-overs, where i would've expected any such discrepancies to be picked up.however, these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of sarah. she never seems at home with the english, and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no-brainer. perhaps a lot has been lost in editing, perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out, but i can only judge what i've seen.now the biggest problem, sarah's (morton) relationship with doyle (sutherland) is incomprehensible. the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son, the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. as you may have guessed. this movie didn't work at all for me, but it is top notch to look at, you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it.

river queen attempts to pack a complicated, sweeping, historical narrative into just under two hours. there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the wanganui scenery is beautifully captured. however, the film did suffer from some poor leads - samantha morton (sarah) especially came across as unconvincing. there seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear view of her destiny. kiefer sutherland's character - private doyle - seemed to be pointless and for the most part - unintelligible. keifer's irish brogue needs a little polishing. on the other hand, cliff curtis, temuera morrison and rawiri pene (as sarah's son "boy") were well rounded and believable.the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed. it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up. e.g. how on earth did wiremu know how to find sarah and doyle? no explanation and very unsatisfying.i did go to this movie with an open mind. i hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production. what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.

this is the 1990's tv show,not the movie from 1979.it looks to be three episodes totaling just under 90 minutes.before watching,i thought it was one of the movie versions,and i noticed right away,it had a tv show feel to it.i didn't care for it too much.i just felt the story wasn't there,and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama.i was looking at the time elapsed on my dvd player frequently,as i was really bored.i also thought some of the dialogue was,to put it politely,not good.plus, i thought the acting left a lot to be desired. but that's just me however,it is good clean,wholesome family entertainment.there's certainly nothing offensive here.kids will likely enjoy it.for me,the black stallion is 4/10

this was a very nice concert by the one and only mj. the choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. the vocals were okay. i have to admit that his vocals were crap on human nature and billie jean. you couldn't hear him half the time. the other songs make up for the singing. the highlights of the show are: jam smooth criminal i just can't stop loving you she's out of my life thriller billie jean (the dancing not the singing) black or white man in the mirror the concert was almost perfect. if it was anybody but mj it would have been a 9. it is a must see. i wish i was born then so i could have gotten a ticket to the best concert of 1992.

the film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of russia. i won't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed 1928) but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man. we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures, ranging from a one arm man beating a horse, to a toothless soldier in the war. everything in between is awkward, haphazard and quite unnecessary. it would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant.in all, one should view this if they are an art student, on hallucinogenic drugs, or a student of pre-tarkovskian cinema.

while i have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the russian revolution, such as potemkin and ten days that shook the world, i did not particularly enjoy this one. this was mostly due to the annoying and "artsy" way that the director chose to shoot the film. while potemkin excelled in its editing style, this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse--in some places, the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish. plus, and this was truly annoying, the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over-the-top. what i mean by "zombies" is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the ukranian peasants were, the people stand like mannequins in many scenes. and, they stand like this, unmoving, for a very long period of time, while the "evil" capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by. gimme a break! this movie is a wonderful example of style over substance--and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction.by the way, the dvd for this film is improved, somewhat, if you leave the audio commentary on. this makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights.

i was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie it is, so i guess i shouldn't complain. twentysomething tom (gay poster boy robert stadlober) has so many issues he doesn't know if he's coming or going. i wouldn't have stayed but for the pretty girls: serious mavie (anna brüggemann); no-nonsense angie (emma daubas); sarah baumann as the star of the movie within the movie. and then there's tom's soul mate, wild-eyed margarete (jana pallaske). she reminds me of béatrice dalle and gina gershon. if you've got to remember, these are fine memories. she looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and i mean ridiculous, even by berlin standards. i wonder whether i'd have liked this movie when i was the characters' age. my guess is i wouldn't. watch out for indie idols oli schulz and max schröder of "der hund marie" performing as street musicians, feeling no pain.

when i first read about "berlin am meer" i didn't expect much. but i thought with the right people, the right locations, the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler failed, it's so ridiculously unauthentic. it's a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlin's so called scene. of course it's not all about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that's being sold as "the definite berlin movie".and apart from all the credibility stuff, it really is a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented. so it really must be poor directing skills.don't bother watching "berlin am meer" unless you are 17, come from some small town in western germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school. then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool.

when i first heared that there was going to be the world is not enough video game for the nintendo 64, i was so excited. when it finally came out, i was one of the first ones to rent it. i rented it for 7 days, and i got through the whole game!!! the game was to easy and gave out too much hints. a majour dissapointing sequel to goldeneye. take my advice and do not rent this game.sure the guns and gadgets are cool, but one gets tired of a watch lazer that looks like it was taken right from goldeneye with the exception of being a red color instead of a blue color, a poor excuse for a dart gun, horrible stunner and a stupid grapple hook that can only attach itself to things that are yellow and black.i think that rare should of made this game instead of ea who should stick to games there good at making, like sport games and should stear clear of first person shooters and let the masters do the work.

man this thing bites! i am sorry i ever sat down and watched it! friedkin was insane for making a film attempting to win over the viewers sympathy for this lunatic if it were up to me i'd have made the audience hate that low life instead of getting all misty eyed over him! he killed people! quite grizzly i might add too! and friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's "not right"! i say friedkin can forget it! i hate the guy this movie is partly based on and hope they did wise up and give his sorry butt the juice!!! in a nut shell, don't waste your time! it's sick and perverse!

from the brilliant mind that brought us "the exorcist"...and "cruising." "rampage" is unfortunately more like the latter. it's an overall messy movie that has a major made-for-tv vibe going for it. the whole film pretends to hinge on the question, "what if the 'boy next door' was a serial killer?" but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense. the movie is very loosely based on the richard trenton chase case, culling a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome. one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analagous. "sometimes you just have to choose," says the lead character. yeah, sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug...on your tv!

every once in awhile i'll remember that i've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a cross between "whatever happened to baby jane?", "sunset boulevard," the lana turner lsd movie "the big cube" and the manson murders, which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this so-called "movie" was made! there are some descriptions of the plot already here, so i won't go into it. but it's worth noting that miriam hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, ego-maniacal, fading actress. perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the bette davis horrors. the old gal hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it to her. she shows a little too much flesh in this movie, something davis and crawford would never have done. and there's a scene with miriam in the actual tacky hollywood boulevard christmas parade, which must have been filmed xmas, 1968.gale sondergard is old, old, old. it's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks. john garfield, jr. looks a bit like his father, but not as interesting. i think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. if it's not one of the stooges, it's somebody.i was astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this. it's amazing!!!

when i typed savage intruder into the imdb's search engine one of the options it came up with was savage garden: international video collection: the story so far (1999), the only reason i mention this is because i'm a huge savage garden fan & you should do yourself a favour & check some of their music out like affirmation or to the moon and back rather than bother with this average pot-boiler, sorry i just wanted to say that. anyway, savage intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like mgm musical & premiere footage & a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run. it's late 60's hollywood & amid the glitz & glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses, killing them & dismembering their bodies. a young man named vic valance (david garfield as john david garfield) hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress, katharine parker (miriam hopkins) who was 'one of the biggest stars of the motion picture' but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named mildred (florence lake), a personal secretary leslie blair (gale sondergaard) & a young maid named geta (virginia wing). katharine has recently broken her foot & needs a personal assistant & gives vic the job. slowly vic charms his way into katharine's affections & more importantly her large wallet. vic starts to turn katharine against the other employees, but vic isn't what he seems. vic is a drug addicted loon who gets greta pregnant while still having sex with katharine. greta threatens to tell katharine & spoil vic's devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe, no one in the house is safe as vic brings drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll party's & gardening to the parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more & more apparent...written, produced & directed by donald wolfe i thought savage intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time. the script is all over the place & it can't really decide what it wants to be, savage intruder suffers from an identity crisis! the film starts with the discovery of a severed head & limbs, straight after another woman (dorothy kingston) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them. savage intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as vic befriends katharine & shows her how to enjoy life again & having an implied sexual relationship with her, it's actually disgusting to think about as she's old enough to be his grandmother. katharine stops living the life of a recluse & gives up the alcohol as vic appears to make her happy as they go to party's together & hold banquets for katharine's friend like she used too. this part of savage intruder wouldn't look out of place in a disney film! every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by vic shooting up & having silly hallucinations about his mother (sybelle guardino) & chopping her hand off with an axe, he has sex with great at one point as well. then, after greta has been murdered, savage intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as vic is revealed for the loony that he is. savage intruder just doesn't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success. similarly the murder mystery elements don't work & are frankly a bit of a puzzle, why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway? vic as a character didn't work for me either, one moment he's a cool, calm, clever & devious con man & then next he's a stark raving loony! why kill all his other victims but with katharine try to con her? what makes her so different? if it is because she has money why not go after her to start with? so many questions & so few answers... some of the 60's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when vic offers greta a painkiller, in reality hard drugs, & greta says "what do i need a painkiller for?", vic helpfully replies "because your a pain" wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies! or when katharine suggests that vic do some gardening & ask's "do you have green fingers?" he replies "no, but i'm good at grass!" there isn't much gore in savage intruder, some severed limbs & a couple of decapitated heads. there is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why it's repeated three or four times. the silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed. technically savage intruder is ok, the location filming in the grandiose mansion & hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves, the acting is average as is the rest of the production. overall i'd say savage intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away & as a result just doesn't work. it's a mildly entertaining one-time-watch at best & a complete mess of a film at worse, you decide which!

that welles said was that he's been in decline his whole career.there was an interesting story here. unfortunately, welles seemed completely incapable of telling it. instead, he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories, about elmyr, about clifford irving, about his pompous view of critics and experts, oh, yeah, and trying to jump start his current girlfriend's career by giving her unneeded screen time. (oja, honey, when they told you to sleep with the director, they didn't mean one washed up like a whale on a beach!) welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of clifford irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the faked auto-biography of howard hughes. unfortunately, it means the subject of his film, elmyr, didn't get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story.the great tragedy of orson welles was that he peaked early, and then spent the rest of his career sputtering, finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries...

orson welles' 1974 documentary "f for fake" examines trickery and fraud, mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as frauds themselves. clifford irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent howard hughes autobiography, yet, at least it seems, purports his innocence. the other main subject of the film is artist elmyr de hory, a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as real works by the original artists. interspersed among these stories are bits where welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with "war of the worlds".i really wanted to love this film and find it profound since i am such a welles devotee, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just non-linear, it was completely scattered. while i appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and zooms, particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, there was simply too much of it going on in "f for fake". they created a distraction as opposed to lending style. if the story had been more clear and comprehensive, i think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying. the scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects, particularly elmyr de hory. his artistic fakery brings up the topic of fraud in the art world, and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works; and if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums? this is one documentary that i would say to at least give a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you're not enjoying it. it is certainly the most discombobulated documentary i have ever seen; it is a cross between a documentary, an art film and experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. i don't have any lesser opinion of welles after seeing it, but it certainly, in my opinion, doesn't stand out as a glowing specimen in his oeuvre. 4/10 --shelly

there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been done better in a hundred other films. it was barely worth the trouble of watching through to the end. even the bad language sounded tired. tom mccamus, a very fine actor, was particularly disappointing here.

this movie is exactly the same as ridley scott's, "someone to watch over me", which is a classic. it stars tom berenger and mimi rogers and the bad guy from the fugitive. it's a quality movie, with good direction and great acting. this movie is the polar opposite. it's the same plot, just minus any good acting and adding tv movie direction. i do have to say i like the interaction between lowe and the woman. she's hot and their romance is believable on many levels. unfortunately, that alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic ridley scott film.usually crappy tv movies have some redeeming quality that makes them watchable at the very least. i think for me, this film's redeeming value is that rob lowe and the lead female have chemistry. that and i was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality film.

looking all of 29 years old, rob lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation.when the husband of a society woman (leslie hope) is found dead, police suspect the rich chick might have something to do with it. enter rob who immediately falls for the pretty widow even though he claims that he's just trying to be 'helpful'. rob is such a good cop, he is able to sneak some of her incriminating love letters into his coat pocket before he accidentally throws them into the fireplace. monotonous murky drama with an endless drone of background music.this is a good substitute sleeping remedy if you've run out of sominex.

what can you say about a film that makes "the erotic witch project" look like "the english patient." again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "tewp."four buxom sorority sisters and a goofy male guide enter a forest to look for the bare wench, and the women become sexually charged. the bare wench leaves porno devices and a blow up doll, just like in "tewp." they get lost, the doofus gets lost, and the girls find their way back to their hotel. there they reenact the end of "the blair witch project," as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot.at least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, along with the rather obvious surgery scars. the one "natural" gal here is humiliated by the director. in a very unfunny, and overlong, end credit segment, outtake scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again ad nauseum.julie strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench. this one scene seems to be added later, since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it. in the background, as the women cavort and stroke, you can see someone's picket fence. this may be director jim wynorski's backyard.this is just bad stuff. the lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than "the erotic witch project''s. most of the lovin' consists of the four women mashing their eight collective breasts together. i think they are trying to form a silicone based lifeform that would rescue them from this bad career decision. no such luck. if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the makers of "the blair witch project" should be really really mad.this is unrated, and contains mild physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content, and sexual references.

bare wench is another softcore parody of the blair witch project (i think there's about two dozen of those things out there). it has 5 very attractive women (which includes nikki fritz, julie smith, and julie strain), and one dorky guy whose only purpose is to provide comic relief.okay, so i'm thinking "cool. great looking women, having softcore lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so. this should be real good."unfortunately, the producers blew it. there is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. there's a couple of false starts, but the majority of the action is just the women posing for the camera. i guess once the producers had spent their money on the women, and spent more getting them to remove their clothes, they didn't have any money left to get them to actually do anything. and i guess they also used up all their alloted nudity time too early, because towards the end of the video, there is a huge amount of pointless dialogue that is obviously being used for no other reason than to pad out the run time. "you're a liar! no you are! you go into the cave! no you go! i think we should go home! well, i don't!" this goes on and on and on forever.there's way better stuff than this.

after watching this movie, i felt as if i had just eaten a box of stale, chewy cracker jack only to find no prize inside. this movie has real promise: porn stars in a skinemax feature! unfortunately, someone forgot to tell the producers that we like some t&a in our t & a flicks!!! sure, we get a few quick flashes and a couple of "bathing in the creek" scenes. but where's the sex? how can you have four girls, "sorority girls" no less, in this type of movie with only one, pitiful 5 second lesbian scene? good night, usa up all night provides more titillation! look, we don't watch this type of movie for great cinematography, screenwriting or action. we want to see some kink! what a letdown.

wynorski films are always excreble. this is just another case in point. out of the five naked women shamelessly flaunted here, maybe one has real breasts. and that's a strong maybe. no humor, no gore, just boobies, boobies, boobies. and some tepid softcore lesbo action. but know what? for fifty cents less than this video rental, i could have rented legitimate porn. do i feel cheated? with wynorski, always. so i prepared myself for a letdown, as one must always do.

well, this may be one of the worst movies ever, but atleast there are some nice t*ts in it. the movie is a very bad spoof of the blair witch project, and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t*ts, and no point other than to flaunt them.

i give "flashdance" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film. since when does that count as film? jennifer beals plays alex owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer, who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder in a pittsburgh steel factory. not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called mawby's. yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at mawby's, you would think they were working at the best casino on the las vegas strip.alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, nick hurley (michael nouri), who is about twice her age. after resisting nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. alex and nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to alex's co-workers.when beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious pittsburgh conservatory of dance. inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. she angrily tells nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. this is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.of course, alex does eventually get her audition at the conservatory. she puts on a dance routine before the conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the mtv generation. oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the mtv generation.i don't think i can judge whether or not beals can actually act well on the basis of what i saw in "flashdance". this is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that i don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.you have to hand it to the makers of "flashdance" though. this movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. in this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on mtv. if they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that i cared about. instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. a truly forgettable "film".

if it wasn't for the terrific music, i would not hesitate to give this cinematic underachievement 2/10. but the music actually makes me like certain passages, and so i give it 5/10.

this movie was jerry bruckheimer's idea to sell some records . no seriously it was . the thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a lp , sell it and make even more money for the studio . you could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when mtv play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie . this is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about hollywood movies from the 1980s and i rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for american film making and flashdance opened the door to this " let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie " type film makingjennifer beals plays alex owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . there's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and " flashdancing " being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job . it's kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not but i guess none of this mattered to jerry when he asked director adrian lyne to make the movie . actually lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , jenniferbeals is very sweet and innocent looking . fortunately i sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . that's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man ! i bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that

i'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. how sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. i had major problems with jennifer beals and her character. i found alex extremely repellent. beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. she also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. it is very difficult to believe that nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. and what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. in fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. yuck. as for the dancing, i'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. what on earth was that tv dance sequence about in the club? who was supposed to be dancing? i wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! and even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. the camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. and what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? and as many other comments have pointed out, she would never get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. of the 'flashdancers', i actually thought the best sequence belonged to cynthia rhodes (penny in dirty dancing). you could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. this is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. there were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. the other good scene was the break dancing in the street. i also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.some other random points - who was hanna and how did alex get to know her? what was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? how did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?where were her family? was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? the person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a disney film needs their head examined. and anyway, what happened to the ice skater? many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. watch "the little mermaid" instead.

when i first watched this movie, in the 80s, i loved it. i was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything. however, i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd, and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was. i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic. the character developments also lacked in depth. i think that this was, very much, a product of the 80s: the film does not hold up today!

flashdance is one of those awful, stupid movies that you actually kind-of enjoy, just because they're so crap. i just watched it on tv & my friend and i were amazed at how dopey it was. it's true that don simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap, lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of (admitedly catchy) pop, so flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer: the first mtv movie. adrian lyne started out in advertising and it shows because flashdance is almost a commercial for itself. you've already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird, panicky undercurrent, as though it's frightened that you might change your mind at any moment. it keeps selling itself to you over and over, all the way through, using slick commercial-style editing and glossy close-ups of jiggling breasts. the story is wafer thin (i honestly can't think of another film i've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but its a very contrived, calculating movie, so it feels consistent. people say it's dated but flashdance was always rubbish. viewers in the early 80's knew it was just cheesy t&a but it does work in its own silly fashion. there's soppy romance for the chick-flick crowd and stacks of oily, writhing female bodies for their dates, all set to a pumping disco beat. how could it fail? it helps that the dialogue is pointless, so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and, if this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the 'interpretive dance' on display. the scene where a stand-in for jennifer beals convulses/'dances' on stage in front of a tv with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make-up had us in stitches. a genuine guilty pleasure.

i was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and i had never actually seen it until last night. i finally decided to watch it because i like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact. after seeing the movie i am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep.the story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their clientèle with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? they would have all been over to zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre tv watching no theater dance thing that she did? please.it seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs. but i didn't buy for a second that that girl worked in a steel yard. and i didn't buy for a second that i was looking at a real steel yard. steel work is dangerous. you don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb. i love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding. what the hell are they doing in there? or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. she was obviously board and just started cutting random things up.but story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way. flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it, however.the dancing horrible. it is the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined american musicals until...well are we really over it yet? the sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by jennifer beal's complete lack of personality. i mean i am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib.you can't really get behind alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. the dog had more going on than she did.the love affair is flat. it comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. zero passion.even the final scene where she dances for orville redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable. what serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at alex's lame cheerleader routine? in short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts. oh, yeah, there is a good chunk of nudity when alex "rescues" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a laughable bit of hypocrisy). other than that the movie is a waste of time. i wish that the mst3k crew were still in business. this would make good fodder for them.

i saw this movie today on the big screen and i can honestly not believe some of the comments made by people on here. i was really hoping to be touched by this film, but wasn't.i'm ex australian army and very patriotic towards this great country, but i feel this movie no way does justice for us and those soldier who fought at this battle.the movie is poorly filmed. i thought the acting was terrible, they were not believable and they didn't give me any reason for me to care about them. people are saying this movie was graphic, there were a couple of graphic scenes but i found most part very weak. the war scenes were very short and only last a couple of minutes.overall a weak film that doesn't do these soldiers any justice.

for all its wonderful images, for all of its good intentions, this just comes off as yet another disgustingly one-sided, over-glorified, self-promoting propaganda.the message is simple, "all japanese fighting on the kokoda track were sadistic, malicious f*** sticks who enjoyed gutting every last aussie troop, cutting their throats before beheading them." not only does kokoda pick up on "gallipoli"'s only flaw (that the enemy are faceless, nameless, and apparently inhumane), but manages to prove quite the opposite to weir's masterpiece. instead of giving us a perfect film with one flaw, we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature.let's start off with this: we're, without any comfortable adapting to the characters, introduced to these apparently quite laid back, two-dimensional people who we never... ever get to sympathize with. we're kept at such a distance that even when we could so easily relate to the characters, they find a way to keep us away. that alone is a sickening feature, as it drives us from the very plot, helps the horrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression, and makes it so much easier to see the contrast between an overtly sentimental ending and an otherwise lackluster body of a film.in other words, it drags us through a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them) and just as it should end, we're thrown into another eye-roller of a skirmish that ends faster than it began. so, for the as yet still uninformed: when it should end, it starts up again, only to end when we expect more. s***! it's just a confusing and agonizing pace!which brings me to the ultimatum: this is meant to educate us on the events of the kokoda track. it doesn't come close. not only does it detail a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (sprinkling a little "mateship" on top in an attempt to make it relevant), but it succeeds in doing the one thing a film as important as this should be does, it makes us not care.honestly, my eyes were constantly glued to my watch the entire time. the audience around me, all proudly australian, bickering as they came in about how great the film is going to be, groaned, moaned, and whined in disappointment as every one of the painful ninety-five minutes droned on (for a short running time, it felt like apocalypse now: difference being that apocalypse now was a good film and deserved the three hours it got) and on to the point where suicide could wholeheartedly be an alternative should it be mandatory for this film to be watched.though, considering how much the tv has been advertising this trash, i'd say it is mandatory, in a subliminal sense of the word.watch if you like pretty images. though you'd do better watching the constant gardener or gallipoli anyway, since they have superior cinematography and actual plots.overall: *

a totally pathetic attempt at movie about sacrifices of australian soldiers during the new guinea campaign. total waste of money even if you only see it on dvd. thankfully the video store provided a free weekly hire with the dvd else it would have been a complete waste of money. probably made by arty types and full of the symbolism that today's chardonay socialists seem so into. frankly this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave chaps that never came back. somebody please provide the funding to make a decent movie at least the equal of saving private ryan. hopefully the rsl will put as much distance between itself and this movie as possible. the story needs to be told from all sides the australians, the locals & the japanese - although getting the latter to tell the truth about anything that happened during the second world war is highly unlikely. basically its rubbish, don't see it, don't buy it. walk away

this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie, except that there was no movie coming up. the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable. the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly, nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time. i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions.this is most certainly not it. having said that, the acting was great and locations authentic. this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time, instead it isn't even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all.

from all the bad comments about this movie and add them up i feel the same way. it may look like the australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers. in this film it was very terrible and too graphic. i didn't see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what i read. we don't need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through. it's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier. for example mel gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. letters of iwo jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history (although i could be wrong) except flags of our fathers and bridge of the river kwai. you're better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don't tell it right, and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill japanese soldiers. just read history on the internet, mags and in books. movies always kill the sense of realization. what they did to pows in singapore and the philippines was just dreadful escpically to civilians. it just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it.

kokoda was inspired by events on the kokoda track during ww2 when australian militia slowed and ultimately stopped a push by 10,000 japanese soldiers to move overland and capture port moresby. what they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war films. the first hour is just one cliché after another. some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare, when there appears to be little evidence of this. both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side. both sides suffered from logistic shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. as the japanese got closer to port moresby their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall. on the other hand as the australians retreated closer to port moresby their supply line decreased. some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the handbook on standard scenes to include in any war film. the film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. at a time when australia could have done with a great film about one of australia's best moments the film kokoda is a shallow disappointment.

there is no doubt that the kokoda trail depicts a truly great event in australian military history the brave defence of australia against the cruel barbaric japanese army.howver this film fails to take into account the story of the "fuzzy wuzzy's" or the new guinea natives that the australians used to help them carry out there military operations. the film also fails to give a credible account of the australian soldier and his behaviour in this event. it is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like.again the australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in australia';s history the film it deserved. this is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography , bad scripting and dialogue , no character development and cliché jungle warfare scenes.it fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the japanese army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an ill-equipped and badly trained group of australians fighting in a jungle.the film failed as most australian films do to attract a significant australian audience in fact they stayed away in droves.i am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an australian film. i say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how. this government funded film is just another failure by australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids.i am giving it zero stars because its an insult to the descendants of these truly great australians and their enormous sacrifice. what a shameful waste and disrespect and i know this review will provoke more negativity from the movie show crew and most reviewers but i have a right to my opinion and that's what australians fought for our freedom and that includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion.

first off i'll give this movie a low scoring 4 out of 10! it was nothing more than a wannabe film. i felt very let down watching this film. i was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story it's based on. instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugs.it's abit like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending. after watching the film i was left wondering "what was that film all about?" if you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for you.i'm a big fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype. i can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached it's destination.one of the worst british films that i have ever watched. if only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie.

oh dear, just what we need another essex -cockney garbage effort chronicling the rise of the uk footy hooligan/ rave gangster who did of course follow west 'am (east londan/essex style). didn't anybody tell you that they won the world cap!? and then of course the inevitable decay into uk rave culture underworld. blah blah blah. why how and who would want to fund a film like this i do not know but lets pray that it was from private financiers (lets see ex drug dealers, merchant bankers -we all know what to call them, and the rest of the mockneys) rather than publicly funded means. hopefully with the recession we will not see the like of this again. if we do we will be calling the death knell for british films and of course we will all be able to blame britains number one mockney country gent wannabee gangster guy ritchie.

having had more than a few mates suggest i check rise of the footsoldier out, i eventually got round to it last night. undoubtedly the story colton leach has to tell (and did so in his autobiography) is a compelling tale of one mans ascent from terrace boot boy to connected underworld villain. this film sadly compromised in quality by miscasts, appalling accents and woeful acting.ricci harnett in the lead role of leach does a reasonable job of conveying the transition from thuggery to serious criminal but his accent is all over the place. as his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts. terry stone as tony tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill fitting wig (or the worst barnett going)dialogue that was so expletive riddled it bordered on juvenile and an over the top vehemence in line delivery reducing tucker to parody.what troubled me most about this film was that the events leading up to the shooting in rettenden, essex and the formative years of leach are of genuine interest to crime fans and fans of football hooliganism so, to have this story sabotaged by a lack of credible accents and acting left me feeling an opportunity had been missed. roland manookian and frank harper provide the films only source of authenticity. on the positive side some of the films pacing and construct flowed well and kept the attention. the violence was well choreographed and aside from an over reliance on projectile red syrup for blood spatterings was on the whole realistic. if you enjoyed the film then it is worth checking out essex boys telling a similar tale from fictionalised viewpoint and also featuring billy murray.

watching this movie all i could think of was, maybe it gets better, but after 20 minutes i couldn't watch it any second longer. i don't want too wast to many lines about this, but really its a complete wast of time. all the actors say is c*nt this cont that. if you are still going too watch it, don't say i didn't warned you. maybe if you are an hooligan or something, you might think its a tribute to your hobby. again.. film is a term that encompasses individual motion pictures, the field of film as an art form, and the motion picture industry. films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras, or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects. .

i am a big fan of british films in general but especially gangster movies. unfortunately this film was shockingly bad. i think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good customer reviews. the idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable. i have read and heard fist hand quite a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they have nearly all been glorified with over the top violence etc. the only gritty true to life event in the whole film was the range rover murders where some overblown bouncers got rubbed out for messing with people they could not handle. this film is a disgrace to british cinema! it has no plot and no decent acting and just relies on being violent( gritty and realistic as some people like to put it) the sort of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget or film camera just as the sort of people this film is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of no consequence.

this is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has blighted the british film industry since mockney guy ritchie unleashed lock stock and two badly acted barrels. this "true life" story of carlton leach (who?) has everything that is wrong with this genre, a truly awful script that consists of people screeching "cant", "fahcking cant" and "i'll kill ya, ya fahcking cant" ad nauseum. the acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most recognisable cast members being two former soap stars quite visably out of their depth. for some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of essex hasn't, and that we should be interested in some low lifes story. why? this isn't goodfellas despite the blurb on the dvd cover. the story centres around a football hooligan turned bouncer turned gangster who's friends end up getting shot. boo hoo. the fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film. in all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people pretended to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time. people talk about how violent the film is as though it's the sign of a great film and, although many great films have violence in them, this is just an excuse for the fx man to show what he can do. overall this film is a reminder of why the british film industry is defunct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions the better.

blame guy ritchie. the late 90s success of ritchie's cliché-ridden lock stock and two smoking barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered. sadly rise of the footsoldier - the true story of essex hardnut carlton leach - isn't likely to reverse that trend. despite a decent lead performance from hartnett, the film falls victim to all-too familiar east end stereotypes. they're either busy blowing someone's brains out or shagging a scantily-clad blonde.from fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties, footsoldier charts leach's rise through the ranks of thuggery. leaving the terraces for nightclubs, leach becomes a bouncer where he's given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone. here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders pat tate (fairbrass) and tony tucker (stone), and begins to realise gang-warfare ain't what it's cracked up to be.there is fun to be had deconstructing writer-director julian gilbey's laughable join-the-dots yob patois, as every sentence seems to start with an, 'i'm gonna fackin'' or 'you fackin'' or, on occasion, 'so then i only went an' fackin'', typically concluded with a mandatory 'caaaant!' the direction, too, smacks of sadism, especially the obvious glee gilbey gets from filming violent scenes in close-up and, in the case of the bloody shotgun-to-the-face denouement, in triplicate.director gilbey's use of the classic rise-and-fall gangster narrative isn't what will condemn footsoldier to big screen obscurity. nor is it the fact that half way through, the film annoyingly sidelines leach in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of tate and tucker. it's gilbey's sickening appetite for scatter-shot violence that ruins the film; whether it's a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train, it's all unnecessarily prolonged. footsoldier doesn't so much pack a punch as leave you feeling violated and more importantly, robs you of two hours of your life you won't get back...

this movie could have been great. it is not in my opinion. the storyline is fragmented, the editor appears not to be able to choose between a guy ritchie-style of storytelling and a more straightforward one. there is a great emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. too much so if you ask me. the characters are very shallow and stereo-typed, i would have liked to see more depth there. it is hard to identify with the main character. as a result the movie remains shallow as a whole.the movie says it gives the spectator an inside view of the british criminal underclass, more in particular the essex underclass. football-hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, lots and lots of violence. violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. in this movie no-one seems to use his (or her) brain, we're looking at a bunch of animals in clothes. like i said, there is not much of a plot and the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. if you're a male below 30, like gore and hardcore violence and think that's entertaining, than this is a movie for you. if you're looking for a movie portraying real people with a well developed storyline, suspense and depth, well... you can skip this one.

'rise of the footsoldier' follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster carlton leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, guns, violence and did i mention violence?protagonist carlton leach (ricci harnett), member of the i.c.f (inner city firm); a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters, guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 'range rover killings', in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional 'hits'. leach's success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters, profitably benefiting from the 80s/90s rave scene and drug culture.opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but left wholly unsatisfied. the next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions. each of these basically establishes yet another typical 'hard man', shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims, before probably coming to an even nastier end. what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters (for example a family man blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are either anti-climactically killed, or their storyline left unresolved. the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events. this film has been made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience who prefer violence and 'ard nut' slang to an actual storyline. 'rise of the footsoldier' borrows too much from 'football factory', leaving out the good bits, demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. the violence, although brilliantly shot, seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment. the implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but machete-wielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer. the audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion. attempted 'gritty-realism' is further destroyed with a substance called 'truth serum', which the turkish mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals. this is not the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and renders the interrogation almost absurd.the actual scenes of violence (before becoming repetitive) hold some tension, spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel. seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand-held camera work saves the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack there of) limits it to a niche demographic.in essence, the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented, and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot. this film has a place in the market, but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn't for you. http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/

the motion picture association of america has seen fit to advise potential viewers and this is particularly useful to parents and guardians that this film which is hereby titled "frostbite" is given a "r" rating.the "r" rating has specific information which allows any person who not knowing anything about a film to know something about what this film provides.the "r" was instituted for sexual content including nudity and perverse dialog,language, crude sense of humor and drug use.there is no reward in viewing such a film though it would be useful to know if this could be removed as a possibility at all i would as this reviewer remove such a possibility.this is a film whereby merely a 1 was not the equal to a number as it did not qualify as a film to be counted,in fact such as this purpose is with this film so should such a purpose be with this films place at all.this is a unwholesome and undesirable offerring that should of been given a much stricter interpretation because at no point is conduct or language suitable for viewing and this kind of film may wish for a blacklist rather than a stricter definition as to its content.it is suggested hereby that the stricter definition would allow,it is hereby put forth a criminal charge.it may any way irregardless of its rating.this is a unsavory world which would damage any persons viewing this film as its purpose is to commit an offense.it is an offense and it is offensive in its purpose.there is no sense of humor in the film but a depraved and indifferent purpose as to its undesirable underpinning.without reservation this is a do not see list and perhaps not entirely necessary to say to any adults considering but to any whose interests concern the environment to which there children grow up in,do not allow nor provide any young person the viewing of this film it is unfriendly.society often sends the wrong message when these kinds of problems are in the public domain let this not be one of those times.

this movie is beyond horrible avoid at all costs!! i want my hour and 20 minutes back!!!not funny at all, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. swears spill out of the speakers like a waterfall, each one getting more annoying as the last, and not contributing to the comedy or plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!).all in all, its a lame-a$5, watered-down -typed- "out cold"ish movie - but tremendously awful. the movie focuses around two groups of a city poories and richies (how obviously dumb is that?), where the two opposites have snowboard battles with each other. (story is much like a 4-year-old's bed time story without all the swears and stupid jokes)movie - 1/10 - because you can't give any lower scores

after a while i realized it was just my iq slowly dropping. frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one, and i mean no one, is even trying. i rooted for the dorky hero to die inside that trashcan (how did he even manage to fit in there, anyway?), traci lords, the queen of b movies, was horribly unfunny and ripped me and my friends off by not showing her boobs a single time.the "characters", though i use that term loosely, are people so exaggerated and one-dimensional they might as well have used cardboard cutouts. the "jokes" (i use this term loosely as well) are simply hilarious. a guy's fart causes an earthquake. roflcopter! our "hero" gets a butt acupuncture by traci lords. oh god, i can't breathe! the blind guy uses the f word repeatedly! this is too much!!! say what you want about the acting but i thought adam grimes did a pretty good job at playing a mentally challenged snowboarder. apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs. i think i counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the entire film, scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time. that's five minutes worth watching out of 83 minutes of unfunny trash. don't watch this. watch barb wire with pamela anderson - at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that trashy flick!(r#26)

this movie is just downright horrible, the movie was only an hour long and for about 25mins of the movie was just useless random snowboarding clips that don't even connect to the movie. the storyline is completely "retarted", my 5 year old cousin could probably write a better script. i don't understand how someone could fund the production of a film like this ... horrible. this is definitely the shittiest most horrid movie i've ever seen in my entire existence. i think the casting director just took some random kids from off the street to act in this movie. the directing, acting, producing and writing for this film are all really bad. i feel bad for the people who wasted money funding this garbage. u couldn't pay me to watch this crap again.

i can't actually think of one good point in this film. the story is absolutely terrible. the acting is as blunt as a carrot, and the script is so bad it makes you want to kill yourself. ok fine if you love (and you have to love it to understand) snowboarding you might enjoy it microscopically better, as it has large mountains and some cool moves but apart from that it is terrible. it has some absolutely stupid ideas and it is racist with both black and white people insulting each others races. the only time you will laugh is when you are laughing at the stupidity or you are feeling embarrassed for the film. i have seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the worst film i have ever seen. if you have this film i would suggest you take it back to wherever you bought it from and get you money back.

what makes this movie so damn bad? is it the lame sub-par juvenile humor? could it be the horrid "trendy" suck ass music? perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story? or maybe even the fact that traci lords gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd sandwich. regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks, the fact remains that it really really does. i have never wished i could be watching a movie with dean cameron in it instead of what i was watching in my life, but "ski school" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty.my grade: f eye candy: nikol nesbitt, buffy tyler and suzanne stokes all unleash their tupperware titswhere i saw it: starz on demand

i'm a big fan of kevin spacey's work, but this is a sub-standard film. if you think it looks interesting, or you saw it and liked it, go and check out john boorman's "the general". it is basically about the same guy, but is far superior in every way (and doesn't suffer from the hollywood glorifications).

the german regional-broadcast-station wdr has shown both "the general" and odc. on saturday i've seen "the general" and i thought, it wasn't very bad, but not very good too. but yesterday i've seen odc and i switched it off after about an hour. although kevin spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless. "the general" told the story straight and ordered, but odc just wanted to be cool. there is a reference on the guy ritchie movies "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" and "snatch", but doesn't have the coolness of these movies.so, in the end i would rate it 3 of 10!

this film is terribly bad. kevin spacey is a really great actor, he shines in la confidential, american beauty, usual suspects, 7 etc.. but this is truly rubbish, he came nowhere near a decent irish accent, maybe he should have practiced it with kate hudson while she was doing about adam. to irish people this film is laughable and even worse, its quite irritating for several scenes. i think the producers made this film hoping the target audience (non-europe)would had never seen or heard of the 'general' or martin cahill and be enthralled in an intriguing and entertaining story. total crud!!

i have seen many - possibly too many straight-to-video, no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the "good ones", or the ones that are less sucky, as ridiculous as that sounds, hahaha. dr. chopper, is what i kindly like to refer to as... absolute crap. nothing about it is enjoyable - the acting sucks, the characters suck, the killer sucks, the gore is minimal... and sucks. it is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin, owned by the parents of one of the kids. it is meant to be a relaxing retreat, but little do they know that a deathly ill former plastic surgeon-gone bad, along with his two female assistants, search for usable tissue to save the doctor. his name is dr. chopper since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course, chops. this is just a terrible movie, not worthy of anyone's time. enough said.

low budget "films" like this just give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter. in other words, if there are people out there who are willing to finance a piece of schlock like this, than there's certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like myself who can actually write stories. this film is right up there, or should i say "down there" with the ed wood's of the world. the story, if you can call it that, and the dialog, not to mention the sophomoric acting, is a travesty toward the genre itself. someone should have driven a stake through this stinker while it was still just on paper. it follows that since literature has pretty much been killed off, that film should follow. in order to have a good or even just passable movie, you must have at the very least decent writing. the legendary curt siodmak springs to mind. they used a lot of his stories for low budget films way back when but they still come off today as good, serious entertainment, i.e. "donavan's brain". the cast for this "work" should seriously consider going back to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future feeble attempts at appearing in front of a camera. avoid this one like the plague itself!!!

stupid horror film about five 20 somethings (3 guys, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. what they don't know is dr. chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anybody who ventures in their woods. they use their body parts for some experiments...or something. also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some cleavage.pretty desperate. the story is confusing and boring; the gore is laughably fake; dr. chopper and his assistants overact terribly; there's some dreadful black "humor" in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill them.this was pretty insulting. there are a few pluses. a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good! chase hoyt is great as reese; butch hansen is ok as jimmy; ashley mccarthy is also good as tamara and robert adamson has his moments as nicholas. best of all is chesley crisp as jessica--she was excellent! some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well-acted and interesting. unfortunately the dialogue wasn't really there for them. i'm giving it a 4 for their performances--but nothing else here is worth mentioning. hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them.

this movie sucked on so many levels! ever seen the dentist? this movie made the dentist look like a masterpiece. i do not recommend this movie to anyone, unless of course you are really really really really really bored, then maybe. it was so corny. the killer reminds you of the grandpa from the monsters, except he has goggles on. when jessica said "i want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, i thought she was going to kick his butt, however all she did was throw a frig-gen trash can at him. i was very disappointed. and when the ranger had the crying scene about his wife, i so felt the pain behind his tears.........not!!!!! so before watching this movie, grab a blanket and a pillow, get comfortable because it is very relaxing.

first of all, i'm upset there's no choice of a "0" out of 10. i was bored tonight, and while flipping through the channels, i see dr. chopper. with there being nothing else on, i decide to watch it, expecting it to be just another crappy horror movie, with a similar plot to cabin fever. man was i wrong...dr. chopper made cabin fever look like it should have won numerous academy awards. may i remind you, cabin fever contains a scene of a little hick boy doing roundhouse kicks off of a porch screaming, "pancakes!!", characters who leave their dying friend in a tiny shack to bleed to death, and shawn from boy meets world mistakenly fingering a hole in a girl's thigh.so needless to say, dr. chopper was a big, smelly pile-o-crap. it wasn't even funny crap. it reminded me of a horror movie i had to make in 8th grade, called "the campout". except for the fact that "the campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before filming), better actors, plots, bloody scenes, and camera work. i was hoping to get some laughs out of a poorly-made horror film, but instead i could only watch in astonishment as i thought to myself, "was this made by 8th graders?". the acting was horrible, the events and different little subplots were thrown together and didn't make sense, and the gore and violence was very minimal. i liked how that from a small stab wound, people died instantly, and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knives...if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give the killer(s) an insane killing device.also, what the hell was the point of the sorority girls hazing their pledges? good way to bring in some scenes of girls running around in their bras, even if they have no relevance to the story whatsoever. and i must say, my favorite line was when the blonde says to dr. chopper, "i'd like to introduce you to someone....my inner bitch." her "inner bitch" then proceeds to grab a garbage can, throw it at dr. chopper, miss, and back up in terror of the killer.wheww....well that was a long one, but i felt that i needed to express my feelings on how absolutely horrible this "movie" was. i know that everyone has their own opinions, but if anyone rates this movie higher than a 2, they should be shot to hell......seriously.

ugh, bad, bad, bad, but i have seen worse which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1. just got finished watching this movie and i thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on dr. chopper's face. the worst line of the movie had to be "i like to introduce you to someone... meet my inner b*tch" which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at dr. chopper and then falling on the stage. second worst line, "i'm the park ranger that's gonna f*ck you up" what, this freak ain't even a cop????? did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab (no one dies that quick from a gut stab, i know this cause i see them frequently in the operating room) except super park ranger. dude had like a bucket of blood poor out of that wound, writhes around on the floor some, and then comes in for the finale to take a parting shot at dr. chopper while inner b*tch lies cowering on the floor. and if that don't beat all, he doesn't even have the decency to die then like everyone else. inner b*tch helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help cause he's like her only friend left alive now. since when did these two become friends? i don't think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as getting to know you time but whatever. only watch this movie if there's nothing else own and you have nothing else to do with your time.

i paid $2.00 for this piece of crap, i want my money back. it is a d grade horror movie that isn't so groovythere are many many floors in this film, including the acting, the lack of actual horror, the lack of nudity (which besides the starting nurse (porno outfit) and the still breathing nude corpse flash, there is none.the sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffs/tracks.there are your usual typical characters, the jock, the jocks woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock), the rookie cop/ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gap..or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the pure girl.the make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear "make up line"and natural skin tones, the cover art to the dvd is clearly photoshop/enhanced to make the cover more enticing as dr chopper looks like an old "plopper" the scraggy women that hang around dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this movie.the plot twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad looking fake limbs was laughable, what did they think,.... um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film.dr chopper himself is the most stupid character created i've seen in a while, though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme doctor and chopper (bike) and thought "bingo" ill make a crappy movie about that.i've seen worse before..... but this is just plain bad.. everything about it is bad... the lack of suspense...the lack of actual horror or character development... the lack of a decent storyline ...the only thing good about this film was when it finished. this film doesn't fall into the category ïts so bad its good" for me either/overall 2/10 the director/writer/editor should know better.

possibly one of the best, most horrible b movies ever, as in it's so bad and random,it's kinda hilarious and i don't know how to feel about it..reminds me of cabin fever..there's just something about that kid jumping off the porch doing karate and yelling 'pancakes' that's intriguing. since a lot of people have already outlined the plot and everything all i'm going to do is sum up the quality of the movie with one quote: "i'm the park ranger who's going to f*ck you up". yeah, enough said?. if you're looking for quality or a really scary movie, i don't recommend it. but if you like these sorts of films then i guess you would enjoy it..i don't know how, but i guess some people would.

jonathan demme is such a character-oriented director that, to see him pulling a brian de palma (which is to say, aping hitchcock), it is nearly predictable when he fails to work up much suspense within this tepid mystery. working from a screenplay by david shaber, from murray teigh bloom's novel, demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between alan j. pakula's paranoia dramas and hitchcock's dangling-participle thrillers. roy scheider stars as a retired secret agent mourning the murder of his wife who is now busy dodging bad guys who are out to kill him. takes off right away, but the script is full of flimsy threads and any excitement dies out quickly. there's a visually impressive climax at niagra falls, but demme gets little out of his cast, and even less out of this bummer of a story. ** from ****

i wish it were "last dumb thriller". but thrillers are like that. they are like children: numerous, illogical, and often annoying. they want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child's behaviour or a thriller's plot? having seen this particular child - i mean... thriller - i understand why reviewers refer to it as "a hitchcockian thriller"; they might as well have called it "idiotic" for that's what "hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (look it up, if you don't believe me). even the soundtrack is old-school hollywood which is a mistake: it doesn't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony. besides, how dare they steal de palma's idea of stealing from hitchcock?! the story is absurd. scheider's wife is killed, and her killers are never an issue. instead, first his former employers follow him around, and later decide to kill him. why do they decide to kill him? no explanation. perhaps because the fbi is a dark, dark organization ("x-files") which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons. or perhaps because it's fashionable to want to kill scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. and while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy, in reality the killer is... janet margolin! yes, the woman occupying scheider's living quarters; the one that briefly hinted she was "depraved". why does she go after scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife's murder? a pure hitchcockian (look it up again in the dictionary, in case you forgot what it means) coincidence. and how about that brilliant motive of hers...! her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in ny, and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is scheider's grandfather. as a result, margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time (among other things) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother. how hitchcockian (look it up) is that? the finale then shamelessly rips off the mount rushmore scene from "north by northwest", except that the love-interest is a killer and she doesn't get saved.the movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting. check out the silly and obvious way in which napier follows scheider at the cemetery. let's also not forget the moronic plot-device of napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it wasn't a gun! how brilliant! napier in the tower: now, there's another string of illogical behavioural patterns. j. demme was, is, and always will be a director without style, without flair, and the man who directed "philadelphia". let's give him another oscar!

aalcc informs us that 14-year-olds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious. to those who don't know that, the film performs a public service. otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason for being. i will allow that the camera-work is sometimes striking, but also that it can be madly self-indulgent at other times. the actors occupy screen space and screen time, but do not compute as compelling human beings. i suppose the e-mail that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker, but i simply couldn't tell enough differences to do so, and really didn't care anyway.

i never figured out what the attraction of karen black was. she always had those beady eyes and kind of an odd look about her. she seemed to often be eccentric or cast as the "other" woman. in this one, she is the psychic adviser and expert on the occult to a crummy producer of bad commercials as he learns astral projection. he is a mean sucker, even without the new baggage. apparently this is the avenue to immortality, because if you get good at it, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. i believe star trek had a plot like this with jack the ripper hanging on for several centuries. anyway, this guy is really dangerous. he has a nice family and makes them miserable. he begins to murder friends, just because they have an unkind comment for them, or he doesn't like them. you can see the ending coming from the back row in left field. it's a very harsh, humorless movie. most of it must be taken as truth. why are some called but few chosen? i found it long and not very satisfying.

this is a good plot concept, so why-o-why is it such a poor film. the acting is terrible and every shock is signposted so far in advance that it is almost laughable by the time it reaches you. spend your time and money elsewhere, this is not worth watching.

"a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend. learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body, the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing. unfortunately, the man discovers while he is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.the synopsis isn't entirely correct, as it turns out.anyway, the movie opens with a dizzying "out-of-body" example of handsome director winston rekert (as paul sharpe)'s newly discovered "astral body" experience; it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight. young andrew bednarski (as matthew sharpe), being a kid, draws pictures of "the blue man", as his murder spree begins. handsome detective john novak (as stewart kaufman) discovers the victims are connected to mr. rekert. mr. novak's investigation leads to the supernatural; a prime example of which is karen black (as janus), with whom rekert fears he is falling in love.several in the cast perform well; but, "the blue man" winds up tying itself up in a knot. aka "eternal evil", its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good.

the use of "astral projection"(wandering soul), to exist outside of body, with the result inflicting horrible death(..crushing the insides of victims leading to broken spine and ruptured organs)on those close to the one with such ability, is the threat of eternal evil, providing karen black(..as janus) with another "unique" character to fool around with as a woman who influences a commercial director, paul sharpe(winston rekert) tired of his waning marriage and dull career. in actuality, she's dying and needs his body, her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son(..his son has a "special friend" who talks him into things, even poisoning himself at one point). a detective, kauffman(john novak) investigating the unusual homicides concerning those killed by the benevolent spirit, links paul to the deaths and through him uncovers janus. soon both realize that janus must be stopped or she'll simply move to another human host. what paul doesn't know is that his new secretary is janus' lover, both were actually older intellectuals featured in his documentary of astral projection called wandering soul.director george mihalka(my bloody valentine)certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie which contains a rather bizarre premise. it seems that paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the shape of a "blue man", manipulating the kid into disorderly conduct. black, despite the star treatment, rarely is shot close up taking advantage of her face which can produce the type of malevolent evil her character warrants. instead, she's shot from afar, her voice dubbed, and she never quite establishes herself with the proper menace which is an opportunity lost, in my opinion. for some reason, despite the intriguing(..if oddball)idea of astral projection causing a spirit to kill folks from within, the film just never takes off. the soundtrack is very "yanni-ish" and the lighting(..and sound), while at times moody and effective, often is quite murky. the pacing is a problem, also, as the story mules along. the cast is rather limp, especially rekert in the lead, his performance erratic, at best. it doesn't help that there are few characters(..except paul's wife)we could care less about, and what really hurts is that paul himself isn't exactly the most lovable person in the world..he can be quite difficult and moody, his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior. black should've been a more prominent figure in the film, yet remains mostly in the background, talked about in dialogue between paul and kauffman, but rarely does she get a chance to amuse us with her histrionics, which is a shame.

tv director uses astral projection to kill people taking the form of the blue man.dull uninvolving horror film that kind of just sits there before your eyes and makes you wonder why you are watching it. i sat through the film to the end and i really can't give you more than a cursory account of what the film was about because i kept finding my attention diverted by other things.i can't really recommend this. i think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that i paid a dollar for the dvd as a double feature and i feel kind of ripped off.

i'm shocked that all the "hated it" ratings are sixes and sevens, still above average. to me, this seems a case of "the emperor has no clothes". i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's...regardless, it became a struggle to sit through and watch. the dvd i saw did have some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. some of it is hard to understand. the jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you struggle not to 'tune out' after awhile. some of the shots were nice, and the realism was there, even if some of the performances were not great.(jimmy cliff did a good job) the plot is not bad, but quite predictable. in the 1:43 film, the highlights are jimmy cliff(ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shoot-outs and a fight. probably 15 minutes or so. the rest is pretty boring. btw, near the beginning of the film, there are some weird cuts with the ivan character that seem like a editing mistake, which made me laugh for a bit. one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times, that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there. the ending was kind of interesting, showing how the media from a young age influences people, it could also be a general comment on the white man's/colonialism's influence on jamaica. other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition... in closing, the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile, the film much less.

anna kokkinos' success with' head on' now begins to look like it depended totally on the script and alex dimitriades great lead performance. the degree to which this latest, "the book of revelation" is both derivative , pretentious and utterly unoriginal ( except for tristan milani's fine cinematography) seems to bear this out. . alas, there have already been quite a few aussie movies dealing with such themes , some reviled for 'sexism' (and/or explicit sex scenes) in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond and maybe they're worth looking at again after this piece of fluff. of course, setting the whole thing in the world of ballet and making it all achingly slow (and in its choreography, like a 1960s dutch ballet experimental number) does suggest great art if you've not traveled around much-and then only if you never progressed beyond art theory 101.add to the pretension, appallingly arch dialog ( "you will do as we command...") and the whole shebang falls onto its well funded face. then there are the 'sexy' bits : straight from dario argento.given the lovely but truncated performance by colin friels - how about a real city primeval thriller ?all in, all ,with 'the book of revelation' , the feminist project has been set back yet another decade - and with the willing and deeply imitative (of male writers like henry miller, william burroughs, even bukowski) collaboration of some collective in melbourne, oz, suffering from a form of educational -and ideological- amnesia! no revelations await us here.

i was also disappointed with this movie. for starters, the things that happen to him don't seem too terrible to me (sorry male chauvinist pov). as is pointedly said by one of the lady captors: "most men would _pay_ to be in your position". to which he replies "but this is not _my_ choice". ok, ok, fair point, so how bad was it really? please let us know. but now the kicker: he does not let _anyone_ know, until after the movie-end (unseen). not his girlfriend, not is mentor, not the police, not anyone. in stead, he comes up with the brilliant plan of f*ck*ng every girl he knows, so he may recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his captors. i thought he'd just had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his captivity? isn't it time to take a little break from all that? for me, his, to put it mildly, ill advised actions broke the "suspension of disbelief" of the movie. i took out a book while watching the last half hour out of the corner of my eye.

this looks like one of these australian movies done by "talented" students and funded by the government. it is chock full of smart shots of colors and shapes and verbal excursions into freudian psychology to be appreciated by art students and teachers alike, but in general it is perceived a stupid mockery of good cinema, good storytelling and generally good taste. this what happens i guess when art students become so obsessively indulgent. "pink flamingoes" is miles ahead one the same subjects. some porn movies from 70s are far more watchable and inspiring. book of revelation is not entirely without merits, but as an overall experience it is well below average b-grade.

i have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded. a subject which could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double-standard, failed miserably.rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control, the scenes here were for the most part pathetic. it would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed. and the victim's laugh with the cops, when he aborted his police complaint, seemed as genuine as that of the cops. no awkwardness, no hesitance to merely join in. i don't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely. as for his half-a**ed supposed search for his attackers, pathetic. they should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and had him meet colin friels when he first went to the police. the story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence colin friels - the only reason i watched this movie - brings to any project he does.the only concrete revelation of this movie, is, it was crap.

firstly, the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie. it started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. even his attempt to tell the police failed, which just added to the annoyance value. there were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile. the plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure. the ending was nothing short of "hey we've run out of budget let's stop it here now!!"...if i'd written a novel that ended this way i'd top myself. trash trash trash!!

well it certainly stunned me - i can not believe that someone made another australian film that's even more boring than somersault. the story is implausible, the characters, with the exception of friels' and mailman's characters, are unlikeable and wooden, tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and the "sex scenes", which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic, would have been at home in a low-budget porno flick.this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema-going that has had me on the edge of my seat....ready to get up and leave.the best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.

book of revelations starts very well. daniel, an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women.after that, nothing else really happens. there is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending. daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic. he quits dancing, has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman.i have seen a good share of art-house movies but this has something missing in it.the main leads are fine; but some characters does not seems to be completely defined.

sure, i like some indie films. a lot, actually. i don't always understand them, and that's okay. not all of them were meant to be understood, especially by mainly main-stream people like me. i'm probably showing my ignorance, but i'm still puzzled why 'book of revelation' is called that. i love those end-of-world stories and the only thing i could see similar to the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through this. i'm not talking about the subject matter; perhaps i've been subdued from all the other torture/porn i've seen. it was just the incredibly slow story, one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours. (major spoilers lie ahead) hetero-man dancer gets abducted, seduced and raped six ways from sunday, or in this case 12 days, by three hooded women. upon his release, after his somewhat distraught dancer/girlfriend barely flinches (other than dropping a glass) after wondering which she missed more: him or the cigarettes she originally sent him for upon abduction. still in a state of reasonable shock, he refuses to talk, and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing happened and he takes a well needed shower. problem. as much as he's tormented through the flashbacks to his, uh, "attacks," he's as equally aroused. granted, i haven't been bound and used as a plaything, but i doubt i would really "be in the mood." oh, i forgot, and how does he try and solve this crime? sleep with as many women as he can to try and spot the birthmarks or tats the criminals had. i see where they're going with it  show a gang rape from the male pov. fine, twist notwithstanding, you could never feel for this guy. only saving grace was the good acting of the lifetimetv dancer/cancer instructor. but even she couldn't save the film.

many questions arise about the making of this film. the first of which is: why make a film that plays out as little more than an awkward female fantasy? it's one thing to leave an audience with issues to discuss about a film's intent, it's something entirely different to go into the process of writing a script which fails to adequately address real human issues before they are rendered on the screen.why the outrageously melodramatic and often comical soundtrack? why the excessive and frequently clunky dialogue? why is the lead character's girlfriend one of the hooded abductors? what purpose is there to turning the lead character's freedom from abduction into a joke by having him complete his "mission"? (this is a classic little aussie film moment. resort to quirky comedy at the most inappropriate moment.) why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens? (this accounts for approximately 15 minutes of the film, which is at least 30 minutes too long.) why, if a man is imprisoned for so many days, does he not endeavor to make a serious attempt at escape?the director, who co-wrote the script, has failed on many counts to deliver a satisfactory story. dave garver, australia.

here's a couple of paragraphs out of an essay i wrote for university about tbor."the book of revelation is an erotic thriller about sex, power and a talented dancer's struggle to regain his sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three cloaked women. the three women that violate him all have distinctive marks on the bodies; one has a giant birth mark on her buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on her lower stomach and the ring leader has a small circle on her breast. so he lives his new life in search of these markings, and to find them on these intimate places he does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, he has sex with them. an hour and ten minutes into the film and you feel like he has almost had a piece of every woman in melbourne.the film is a giant chunk of pretentious celluloid; it is like grandiloquence drips from every frame. at only one point towards the films final climax does kokkinos give a scene the same energy and strength as her debut feature head on had in droves. as like many films funded by the government bodies the film takes it self way to seriously, the script and its execution appear to be chores rather then gifts and unfortunately for the talented thespians, their brilliant performances (particularly tom long as the fractured protagonist) are stuck within the confines of a pompous wan k fest."

while walking to buy cigarettes, the professional dancer daniel (tom long) is abducted and forced to have kinky sex along many days by three hooded women. when he is released, the director of his company isabel (greta scacchi) has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives a cold reception to him. the disturbed and humiliated daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to seek out the abductors. daniel has sex with many women that he suspects that might be the kidnappers. "the book of revelation" is a weird movie with a promising beginning that loses the initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap- opera or soft-porn chic. the production is classy, the cover of the dvd is awesome but the characters are not well-developed and the trauma of daniel seems to be excessive since most of the men would fantasize with the dream-situation that he was submitted  to become sexual object of three sexy women. the melodramatic development with the illness of isabel does not add any value to the plot; the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title. it is very clear that the screenplay about a man's feelings was written by a woman. it was good to see the still beautiful greta scacchi again and her make-up in the end is impressive. there is a saying in portuguese that could be translated to english as follows: "if the rape is inevitable, relax and come." daniel should have done this and spared me of watching almost two hours of a pointless story. my vote is four. title (brazil): "o livro das revelações" ("the book of revelations")

low budget junk about bloodthirsty cultists in greece headed by peter cushing. its up to priest donald pleasance to stop them. crown international released this crap in 1978, and it was "dog-of-the-week" on one of the episodes of sneak previews with gene siskel and roger ebert. i forget which of the two "dogged" it, but i see the point. crappy movie has the worst peter cushing and donald pleasance performances i've ever seen. there is a monster on the video box. no such beast exists in the movie. instead you get a statue, but at least its atonomically correct. (woo hoo!)the cultists look like the klu klux klowns...if a group could exist. skip it.

how can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of peter cushing, the determination of donald pleasence and the bust of luan peters? easy, you give them a terrible script to work with.peter cushing, in an evil role, leads a satanic cult that has captured a couple friends of donald pleasence. donald plays a determined but aloof priest that desires to locate his friends but needs the help of fred from scooby-doo to locate them. he summons the help of a new york bloodhound, who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon, in his task. meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing people, luan peters, joins the search. if all this sounds interesting, then you, like myself, were mislead.it doesn't take long for the trio to sniff out the baddies but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish. also, women will find this a crapfest. every time they get on the bad guys trail, our two male heroes tell luan to stay at the hotel even though she can handle herself better than the squeamish priest played by pleasence.story: $ (the script really lets us down. no tension is built. no worthwhile dialogue is given the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times luan peters is told to stay behind and let men do men work. if you're interested in seeing a minotaur on film don't bother. we get a statue of a minotaur that spits flames).violence: $$ (there are some attacks and a few sacrifices, but those of you who drool for gore will be letdown).acting: $$ (even though there are three of my favorite actors in this film, there is nothing redeemable here. peter cushing doesn't have much screen time, donald pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and luan peters is ill-used. this should have been much better given the talent involved, but then again, the yankees lose a game here and there too).nudity: $ (luan peters takes a bath but you see next to nothing. she isn't as obliging here as she was in the flesh and blood show).

peter cushing and donald pleasance are legendary actors, and director kostas karagiannis was the man behind the successful greek giallo-esquire thriller death kiss in 1974; and yet when you combine the three talents, all you get is this complete load of drivel! god only knows what drove the likes of peter cushing and donald pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick, but i really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes. the story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids, leading another group to go after them. the pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring. the plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this, and no doubt done much better. the obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point. this really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel. extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended!

donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like "the flesh and the fiends" and "from beyond the grave", pairing up in a mid-70's satanic themed exploitation flick. how can this possibly go wrong? well, unfortunately, it can. to my deepest regret "land of the minotaur" can hardly even be called mediocre, and that in spite of the cast, the exotic setting, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. in a remote little area in greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing minotaur statue. cushing, who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, father roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. "land of the minotaur" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. the titular minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance. his portrayal of rude, bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.

the devil's men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70's shortly before halloween came along, tore up the rule book, set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass window.to cut a long story short a couple of enterprising greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanising, wise talking american investigator milo and stuffy but kind hearted priest father roche. an exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic jiggery pokery - offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unfrightening effigy of the minotaur and only milo and roche can stop him! or something like that.the reality is however horribly dull, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. i strongly suspect that the fledgling film makers blew most of the budget on getting donald plesance, peter cushing and brian eno (for the soundtrack) onboard and hoped that would be enough to sway audiences in the english speaking world.it isn't. the devil's men looks beautiful with assured, camera-work and fantastic locations. eno's score, though basically just a one chord drone that he probably cranked out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking 70's crumpet including that austrailian sort from fawlty towers and uber hottie jane lyle of island of death infamy. but there the positives end. cushing sleepwalks through it, looking like he has a corn cob up his bum and pleasance fusses about trying his best, but never quite getting things right. to make matters worse the character of milo is appallingly flimsy and unlikeable.okay, so it doesn't look that good. but from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. there is an insinuation that the local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never really do anything very much other than shuffle about looking glassy eyed. perhaps they were just tired? just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head milo and roche interrupt the baron's satanic party with laughable ease, sending him on to meet his maker. the statue of the minotaur falls silent and hey presto! satan is defeated.yeah right.the inane optimism that the devil's men might be the first of a series of films is hammered home by father roche's final line mere seconds before the ridiculously rushed ending. "who knows milo? perhaps one day i may call upon you again to help defeat the antichrist." i'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now donald.

my, my, my: peter cushing and donald pleasance must have been desperate for work to have lent their talents to this turkey. a horribly muddled story about satanism in modern day greece, land of the minotaur (aka the devil's men) is a misfire on more-or-less every level imaginable. it has precious few scares (always a slight flaw for a "horror" movie, don't you think?); weak performances; countless scenes where characters foolishly wander off alone or turn down the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group; and some rather irritating editing techniques which add nothing whatsoever to the proceedings. i got prematurely excited at the prospect of cushing and pleasance working together 17 years after the flesh and the fiends - but this film isn't worth getting remotely excited about; it's a huge let-down and rather an embarrassment for its much worthier leads.in a remote region of greece, outsiders such as tourists and archaeologists keep going missing, and local priest father roche (donald pleasance) suspects that something sinister is afoot. he writes to his friend, new york private eye milo kaye (costas skouras), asking him to fly out to greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. in the meantime, three more visitors - beth (vanna reville), ian (nikos verlekis) and tom (robert behling), who are all personal friends of father roche - go missing while snooping around nearby greek ruins. milo eventually arrives in greece, but is initially dubious about father roche's beliefs that the missing people have been snatched for satanic sacrifices. milo and father roche are also joined by laurie (luan peters), the girlfriend of missing man tom. together, they uncover the activities of a minoan devil-worshipping cult headed by creepy carpathian exile baron corofax (peter cushing). these crazed cultists have been busily sacrificing their victims to a statue of the minotaur. furthermore, they seemingly cannot be killed by normal means, so father roche has to use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against them.land of the minotaur should have been much better than it actually is. the plot is so wacky and improbable that it has all the hallmarks of an enjoyably goofy cult/camp favourite. but the handling is just awful. director costas carayiannis has no idea how to link the narrative together cohesively, so the whole thing progresses like it was being made up on a day-to-day basis. he also has no idea how to coax convincing performances from his cast, so they are left to embarrass themselves in either dreadfully hammy (pleasance, cushing) or dreadfully amateurish (skouras, peters) performances. what's worse is that the narrative makes no sense. why would father roche seek help from a private eye who is utterly flippant about his beliefs? how does roche know that the sacrifices only occur during a full moon? how can the minotaur statue speak? why is one one of the sacrificial victims instructed during a vision to stab father roche, only to herself be stabbed a few scenes later before getting a chance to carry it out? and - most baffling of all - why does father roche drag milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and and some holy water to dispose of the bad guys? these questions - and more - will pop into your mind during land of the minotaur.... but, alas, there are no answers to be had. frustrating, dumb and disappointing!

this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so. really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation.we get cliché snapshots instead of characters. one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss, who projects an overdone "tough guy" persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest from a complete american tourister set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or apology. otherwise it's standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in ct.

this should have been a moody, gritty, movie which lingered in the memory as an exposition of relationship where the dominant personality only survives because the personality being dominated sees no hope of change.the acting was intense and skillful, the dialogue worked but the movie was irritatingly ineffective: too many distance shots that suggested lack of focus rather than a broader picture. poor flow. the first 5 minutes could have been missed out altogether.i suspect that, with a different edit, this movie could have been compelling.in its current form it is flat, formless and tremendously disappointing.

sure, the concept had already been done with alf and the charmings: thrust modern society onto one or more out-of-place characters. but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. when i learned about scorch, i was actually very hopeful for something new, as new tv in the 90's so far hadn't impressed me (but at least star trek: tng and the simpsons were still going).what i got was a big disappointment. the acting was awful, but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing, i can't blame them too much for what they had to work with. there were a few humorous moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery. the whole production work on the show seemed too low-budget for what was on tv at the time. in the 80's it would have fit right in.still, it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series, so i gave it the benefit of the doubt. the second episode wasn't as bad, and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride, the show would improve. sadly, my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired, i never got to see it, and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that. all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape.

this could have been the best game ever!! but the game makers just screwed up after 3 assassinations and the ending!! this is a combination of prince of persia, hit-man, gta and age of empires ii (saladin).yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games ever made.you combine the four and you get this game!! it has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, stealth assassinations, open world and the history!! for the first 3 assassinations you feel this game is greatest!! but after the third, things seem to get so repetitive, that you only hope for the game to end.i have played this on a pc and the pc version is horrible with glitches and the stupid side missions are senseless.my advice to all. this is a good game but get it either for the xbox360 or ps3. don't get it for the pc.lastly, this game came from the creators of prince of persia. surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and it is not better than the four games mentioned above!!

enchanted april was one of harry beaumont's last movies- he only directed a few more after this one. he had made the "maisie" movies in the 1930s and 1940s. in the opening credits, it says "from the novel by elizabeth", and completely leaves off the author's last name... rather odd, but since it was von armin, they may not have wanted the german association at the time... sad to hear it was a flop when it was released, with those fun names like frank morgan (the wizard) and jessie ralph, who played w.c. fields' disapproving mother- in- law in "bank dick". two gals in london (ann harding & katharine alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things don't go the way they planned. reginald owen plays the husband with multiple personalities. aside from a few funny moments, it does move pretty slow. ralph is the only bright spot here, as the overbearing take-charge type, and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film. the views of italy are all obvious backdrops. the only saving grace here is that the turner classic version is only 66 minutes long. too bad they didn't give frank morgan a larger role. this was remade in 1992 by the bbc as a british film.

i had been delighted to find that tcm was showing this, as i love the 1992 version with josie lawrence, jim broadbent, joan plowright...this film had a luminous ann harding, a wonderful performance by frank morgan, but others' acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film. reginald owen's arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him. i found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book. the original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete. too bad it was such a let-down.

the final installment in the karate kid series is predictable, poorly acted, and so bad it borders on the enjoyable. but not quite, it's just bad. in this installment ralph macchio's karate kid is absent, already having been in one too many of the episodes. the new kid, played by hillary swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of mr. miyogi's wwii buddies. her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion. in steps mr. miyogi to set things right. true to formula, there is a group of neo-fascist bullies, called the alpha troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move, called the praying mantis. as i said before this movie is a mess, and should be avoided.

in 1984, the karate kid had some charm to it, even if it was little more than a poor man's rocky. alas, producer jerry weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended, and convinced ralph macchio and pat morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. part iii was the definitive low in the franchise, yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. what other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of the next karate kid?wait a minute. next? yep, macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is hilary swank (!), playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named julie pierce. now, the girl has family issues. she also gets in trouble at school. said school has a sadistic gym teacher (michael ironside). as it turns out, though, one of his students is actually a nice guy, and julie falls for him. this gets her in bigger trouble than before, of course. lucky for her, she is currently living with mr. miyagi (morita), an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.all those factors ad up to seven clichés, and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! from beginning to end, the next karate kid is a tired, flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. swank does, thankfully, have the likes of boys don't cry and million dollar baby to redeem this disaster, but why did morita accept to come back? he may have received an oscar nomination for the first movie, and was quite enjoyable in the sequels, but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the "wax on, wax off" gag is stillborn. as for ironside, he is slightly better than martin kove and thomas ian griffith in part iii, but that's hardly a stretch.so, is this picture really that awful? not exactly. there is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty, but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.

they missed up the film when the tried to use some one diffrent. they should of keeped ralph macchio as danny instead of changing it. and made more karate kids with him in it.and also many people were woundering what happen to danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four.

this film is so bad. i mean, who commissions this stuff? and the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983. a bloke puts a female wig on and fights....nuff said.

i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i've ever made for a movie...ever.i could stand to watch this movie, and it is the second movie in all the movies i've seen that is just...a downgrade. the first is open water, that just had no point whatsoever. the next karate kid didn't have any mention of daniel(correct me if i'm wrong, please.),and that ending line came as a shock. it was like, "if must fight...win." then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing, and i was like, oh. okay, so it'll take a while for this next part. and then the credits hit the screen.geez man!! hopefully, i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again, i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid, i really, really do...

well, this stripped my nerves raw, they got that right. i first rented this movie back in the 80's, when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare movie he could find. he also carried all the shock, horror, and exploitation movies he could dig up, and i went through almost of all them. previously i had seen blood feast and 2000 maniacs, and the wizard of gore. they were gruesome (especially for the time period), and the wizard of gore got pretty nasty. the gore-gore girls, however, was the one i remember as being the most disgustingly gory.i rented it on dvd a little while ago because i wanted to hear the commentary, and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes. i forgot that it was made in the early 70's, so fashion had kind of gone downhill by then. i also realized this was a movie i didn't really need to see more than once. it had amusing parts, but gaaaah! it was much more disgusting than i remembered. i'm very jaded to movie gore but a couple of times i just got too grossed out and had to look away. this wasn't a good choice of movie to put on dvd all crisp and cleaned up with better sound and picture quality. the commentary is amusing in parts, and interesting (i think hg said the budget was $6100.00) maybe hg lewis wasn't feeling well that day, but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to get offended when the interviewer from something wild compared him to ed wood jr. sorry pal, but you're not exactly martin scorsese yourself.the extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. a cute reporter and a really unattractive private detective team up (sort of-he can't seem to stand her) to try to solve the crimes. henny youngman owns a strip club. a bunch of really ugly murders happen.i'm going to apologize in advance because i don't want to sound like i need to lighten up, but this movie was so misogynistic it p***ed me off more than "company of men". mainly because the main character's and the director's extreme dislike for females- and the audience- just oozes from every frame. it's not just the murders. the highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity, for no apparent reason, (he's not exactly a threat to george clooney, like i said) and she still follows him around like a puppy. she faints upon seeing a horribly mutilated body and he looks distastefully at her, then pours cold soda from a can onto her face to wake her up. later he calls the police to report the crime- "no...no hurry...she just seems to have...lost face." this guy is the hero. you can imagine how the other characters feel about women. i could go on and on but you get the idea. please note that i am making this movie sound much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it actually is.most of the cast are the type of actors you pray will never take their clothes off- not too easy on the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you're not too picky. the go-go dancers all look like they desperately want to have the scene end so they can get their $10 or whatever the going rate hg paid them was and get their drug fix. ok, it's not quite that bad, there was one dancer that looked like she might have been a pro and also one other cool dancer with a huge afro that didn't look as miserable as the rest, but still not too thrilled. the only slightly entertaining things were a couple moments of brief unintentional humor, such as when a policemen in charge at a murder scene angrily yells "get outta here before i have you all arrested!" not to a bunch of reporters but to some other policeman calmly going about their work (they mutter and stroll off, though). henny youngman is kind of funny though, like lewis says, he said his lines so fast that they almost needed subtitles (i'm sure he was trying to get the whole day over in a hurry so he could get paid and get the hell out of there, though he doesn't look like he minded watching some naked chicks).might be worth seeing just out of morbid curiosity- for the era the movie was made, it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at the time- or if you're really big hg lewis fan and find him or low-budget film-making by anyone fascinating. otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low-budget movies from the early 70's...this movie doesn't even come close to, say, "pink flamingos" when it comes to the skip-the-popcorn factor. if you've never seen an hg lewis movie, i recommend you try "blood feast" first instead, you'll have a much better time.

low-budget schlockmeister herschell gordon lewis reaches a new low (even for him) with "the gore gore girls," a 'film' (snicker) that possesses all of his technical trademarks: badly-recorded sound, poor lighting, and ott gore. this would be tolerable, even a bit charming, if the film at least had an interesting plot ("blood feast," in all its ridiculous glory, is a fine example), but "girls" is a total snooze. completely unlikable pompous-ass private investigator abraham gentry (frank kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who's been murdering out-of-shape strippers (you'll stop caring who the culprit is long before these two are wrapping up the case). as before, the appeal isn't the plot, but the creative methods of bloodletting (including a girl's fanny being tenderized with a wooden mallet) and the occasional flashes of then-risqué skin...but this just isn't enough to elevate the material above tedium.

i can accept the fact this was the next karate kid so ralph macchio can be happily retired from the series, and while hillary swank is great for the role....the plot to the movie is just dreadful.mr. miyagi's old buddy from world war 2 dies, leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand-daughter when her parents die in an accident. the girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local rotc...which i'll explain in a minute, has it out to get her. you know the drill...miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.its hokey, its cheesy, its the 90's....but that's not even the long and the short of it. my first case of "huh?" is why is there a "military division" in high school? i thought that stuff went out in the 1960's, especially in a public school. as much as michael ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a high school? my next gripe is that during the prom scene, the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of people....why? the thing i noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (billy in part 1, sato in part 2, kreese in part 3). this movie is no different. after ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom, blow up eric's car and threaten hillary swank the whole movie.....ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like "um...no" if you're gonna do pathetic face turns, at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod.as for the rest of the love plot between eric and hillary swank....corny but nothing to melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage ralph macchio pulled in the first 3 movies.i will say for its own movie, after watching the first 3 movies, i can accept it being more or less a spin off...but i can't accept the whole military thing, way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously. now if ironside and crew was a wrestling/football team and he was the coach, that would have been more believable.ironside and morita deliver the goods, swank is ok...the rest are the same as anything, the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, that was cool 4 out of 10

say what you will about cinema's "wizard of gore," herschell gordon lewis, it must be conceded that from his first films (1963's trashy "blood feast" and 1964's crackerbarrel massacre "two thousand maniacs") to his last (1972's "the gore gore girls"), the man remained faithful to his muse, gleefully chopping up the bodies of young men and women for the delectation of the camera. in "gore gore," for example, someone has been mutilating the pasty-faced and pasty-clad strippers at the tops & bottoms club, and obnoxious ex-detective gentry is hired by a hotty cub reporter to assist on the case. the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, abysmal acting, repugnant characters, problematic sound and, of course, some of lewis' patented gross-out scenes. thus, one of the strippers has her face shoved into boiling oil; one has her head ripped open; another has her face ironed and her nippies cut off; and still another has her bum paddled with a meat tenderizer until her entire backside is covered with what appears to be buitoni tomato sauce. (i could be wrong here; it might have been ragu.) the film also throws out some fairly lame humor, although some of the lines are pretty funny. for example, we learn that the real name of slain stripper suzie creampuff was...ethel creampuff! a bottle of acid says "made in poland" on it (don't know why, but i thought this was funny). and some of strip club owner henny youngman's lines are, of course, amusing. still, this is not the movie to show to aunt ethel or sister agatha. it is one of the sickest you'll ever see, with only one surefire, crowd-pleasing moment--the title card at the film's conclusion that reads "we announce with pride: this movie is over"!

hillary swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film. pat morita, desperate for work, any kind of work, agreed to reprise his role as the "karate teacher" and bring his brand of karate to the silver screen once again, except this time, hillary "skank" swank is the student.i can just see the hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a "tormented, spoiled brat" female take the role from ralph. the film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level. there's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to. the film was made without any thought of making money because it's just so bad.i would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black-listed for their miserable and insulting efforts.

"the next karate kid" is a thoroughly predictable movie, just like its predecessors. its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer's part, who often wishes the story could move a little faster. despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively because of the presence of morita. he doesn't seem tired of his role, and he does inject some life and humor into the film, becoming the best reason for you to see it. not awful, but nothing much, either.

i only watched this because i saw a couple of good reviews for this, so i was expecting at the very least a half-way cheesy movie. toybox doesn't even deliver that. there are so many problems with this flick, that i don't even know where to start, so i will list a couple of main issues (once again, spoiler warning. just read them, it'll save you the trouble of watching this later).one, this movie starts out with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of both celeste noir (a witch, who the main character claims she is the reincarnation of), and the mid-folker (or something like that, an evil man with a big smile who cuts people open with hooks and sells their innards in pies). i liked that, it was a cute concept, anything to do with pies is simply enjoyable. but then you watch the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend (and what was the deal with him? was he psychic? did he have powers? why did he keep seeing visions that even the so called 'witch' didn't notice??), and them meeting their insane family. not really insane, they just argue a lot. that's what most of this movie is, arguing, and they barely touch on the supposed myth ever again except in a couple of confusing scenes that you can't make heads or tails of.in one scene, berenice (the main witch-related character) wanders off and does some sort of ritual by candle light. it seemed rather important, but absolutely nothing happened after she did it, it just wasted more of my time.and who the hell was that guy with his dog? you see him walking towards the house from the very start of the movie with that evil red-eyed dog, and then he finally gets there and gets killed? what the hell?? was he the mid-folker? was his dog possessed? did someone kill the dog? they never really showed that. also, any scene involving the vicar was completely pointless and only served to weakly explain the lame ending. it was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere! the boyfriend, who obviously had some sort of powers but never explains them. the grandmother, who appeared to also have some sort of witch powers, but never used them. the vicar, who...ok, never mind, there really was no point for his existence at all. and then there was berenice and her stupid amulet. could she really do magic, or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? this was a complete waste of time, and the only reason i give it two stars at all is because a) berenice is kinda cute, and b) it mentioned pies. save yourself the money of renting this and dear god don't even think about buying it, unless wasting money is a new fad.

wow. so my boyfriend and i went to the movie store to rent a film. i like dumb horror movies, so i browsed the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of michael moore's 'sicko'. so then i found the worst of all of them (as i would soon find out). it looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough. the fact that there was an imdb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. so the next night, we put it in the dvd player and from the first five minutes, we were so incredibly confused.the movie is utterly incoherent, with badly placed time-jumps from past to future that leave you asking a major 'wtf?' the plot has no sort of coherent story -- other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but this only actually comes into play in the movie in the last twenty minutes of it. so pretty much for the first hour you have this: random, confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who don't age; bad acting; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair colour; and a host of obnoxious characters for you to get bored with!the movie moves so slow that it's a chore to actually sit there and watch. i'd rather be scrubbing the toilets, honestly. don't bother with it.

rented(free rental thank goodness) this as supposedly filmed in ct where i live....could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matter! dark ninety percent of time, and just an awful attempt at a low budget flick, which can be good if done right. in a nutshell about a bunch of young adults who witness meteor fall, and subsequently fall prey to aliens on a lighthouse island, assisted by keeper and wife. analysis:- acting = dreadful- writing = uninspired- story = done a million times before with different settings- production values = okay (lighting) for budget- effects (creature, digital, other) horrible,very cheap lookingso, you get the gist of it. to add insult to injury, end credits has bloopers of filming - really now......who cares! distributed under a universal company, shocked they would even do so after viewing.finally as alternative, try "creep". low budget, but well written, well acted, and fairly, well, creepy!

i see that the majority of the comments so far have been if not overly positive, then at least positive. i can not understand that. the only explanation i can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film, because this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. it makes "boggy creek ii" and "mutant" look like masterpieces of horror. the acting is shaky at best, and awful for the most part. the entire movie is almost pitch black, probably so they could shoot it all in the same location. the monster looks like something from one of roger corman's worst films. and the plot...well, the less said about it the better.one to avoid at all costs.

this movie is so bad. but its so bad that i was laughing my ass off. for people that like movies, do not watch this one. for people who like movies good and bad, i recommend this one. the story lines shaky,the script is horrible,the acting is horrible to mediocre. the soundtrack throughout the movie was corny but i loved it. the cool catchphrases were a plus tho. ha ha. "if it can bleed, it can die". the fight scenes cracked me up. it seemed to me like they spent more time on those parts than any other cuz the fight scenes for the most part were pretty clean. i almost feel like this movie could have been good if it weren't for the f/x....no it would have still been a crapshoot. the eye thing was corny. and how the chick was eating the guys stomach in the kitchen,they coulda done something where shed be actually eating something or at least put more of the fake blood on her face. and the lighthouse explosion disappointed me. i thought they might have gotten real fire instead of crappy computer synthesized stuff. and the ending was so predictable, which surprised me when they actually did what i though they might do. so overall. id say this is a classic as far as crappy movies go. its in my bottom 5.

this has got to be the worse move i've ever seen!!!!! it was not only boring, it was "gag me with a spoon" dumb. where'd ya find the actors ... on a street corner? who did the special effects...maaco? for god's sakes i could have made a better movie with my cell phone. and if that wasn't bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life. who ever did the makeup for the aliens...must have spent $5 at your local used costume store and called it a day. and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot. puhleez!! it's not even 1/8 % of what it is described as. that description is just to suck people in to buying, renting or paying a ticket to see it. no wonder there was never a trailer to it....ya would have drove them all away!!!!!!!bad actors...$5 special effects...$5.50 fake fire....$1.89 (cigarette lighter) time spent watching this movie....total waste! (i should sue ya for my time watching it)

i like to think i have seen it all. ss doomtrooper. the one about a family of sabertooth tigers. the one about a family of pteranodons. goat eater. demon child (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head. several sasquatch flicks, none of them good. a couple of giant spider/insect flicks. endless hellraiser sequels. endless leprauchan sequels. endless jason sequels. a kickboxing scarecrow. ax 'em, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder. and so on. i watched part of an stv the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems. i have even sat through dreamcatcher, as recently again as last night -- well, i should say i sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago. but nothing compares to predator island, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite. the meteorite looks like it came out of a superman cartoon from the 1940s. so do the aliens, for that matter. the photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad. i turned it off halfway through. good luck.

i carefully checked if there's another movie named as this one, and there isn't ! but i really don't think we all saw the same movie ! there's no way ! how can you vote more than "1" for this movie ?! the idea of this movie let's say it's acceptable. oh, and the acting of dan gordon (chris) is quite good. but those are the only two things acceptable in this project. the others are... awful ? it's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors, the directing, the (so said) "special" effects, even the way that the crew was filming ! i don't even like the way that the camera operators were moving to record the scenes ! this may be the most miserable film i've ever seen. i really don't remember a movie lower than this one... maybe there is, but... i don't think so... ehh, what's done, it's done... that's the movie and there's too late for anyone to change anything. i've voted "1", but my realistic vote starts with a "-" (minus) in front....

predator island starts as six friends, eric (tom dahl), chris (dan gordon) along with heather (iris mcquillan-grace), kim (iana baker) & denise (melissa roby) get invited to spend sometime on kevin's (michael wrann) father's boat partying in the open sea. what could go wrong with such a super sounding idea? well for starters a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat & an alien life-force could emerge from it & try to kill all of you, then again that's just a ridiculously stupid idea, isn't it?co-edited, written & directed by steven castle i thought predator island was crap & it's a simple & straight forward as that really. the script is of the worst kind, you know the sort of abomination that's full of highly annoying teenage character's who do & say the most stupid things, it's full of clichés & is utterly predictable, it makes next-to-no sense, things just suddenly happen without any build up or explanation, it's boring even at only 70 odd minutes & it has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever, not even unintentional laugh value. the film doesn't really have much of what i would call a plot, there's no explanation given as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's minds or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment the person will be 'normal' the next, when the story calls for it & with no apparent cause, they suddenly get green glowing eyes & a sudden urge to turn cannibal. there's not enough horror in it, the so-called action scenes are pitiful & i really don't want to waste another second thinking about predator island let alone wasting my precious energy typing these words...director castle doesn't do anything to make this thing watchable & the 'special effects' are absolutely terrible, this alien creature dude wouldn't even get into a 50's sci-fi film. the filmmakers even play some blooper footage over the end credits but this has to be the least funny collection of mistakes ever, i mean they can't even get it wrong right if you know what i mean! forget about any decent gore as there isn't any, there's a bit of cannibalism & some intestines placed on the unfortunate actors stomach so another unfortunate actor can pick them up & pretend to eat them.with a supposed budget of about $150,000 i have to concede that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget, that's still no excuse for making such a poor film. the whole thing looks very cheap & the acting is pretty bad.predator island is crap, i'm sorry but that's the way it is & i just fail to see what anyone would get out of it. in my humble opinion this probably one to avoid.

from the opening shot of the meteor falling towards earth, you know you're in for something special.this is an ultra-low budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters. the story is unremarkable and nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before. the acting isn't great but isn't completely horrible, however the special effects - of which there are a good deal - are laughable at best. in fact, if you can read this sentence, chances are better than 50% that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers.the movie's saving grace - if you're in the mood for a grade z turkey of a film - is that there's always something happening and it never gets boring. and if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends, you might just find this worth a dollar rental.and i must say i appreciated the opening joke, "that is the dumbest name for an island i've ever heard." probably the best moment in the movie.

i had been avoiding this movie for sometime...because i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts. but, after reading some fairly favorable reviews...from some imdb watchers...i spent $1.50 and rented it at my local video store. need i go further...when i say....this was a buck-50 lost. this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen. first off....i realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this film.....but, why could'nt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from daniel-san...maybe explaining what happened to daniel...hell, they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something. but, no...and to compund the already bad script....they added those stupid monks...i thought monks take a vow of silence...guess these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously...hehehe. the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid...and the paramilitary group of young males....were a confusing concept to say the least....this was far from even being a martial arts movie...with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene....and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once...by the male fighting her....give me a break...she would have gotten hit at least once....i guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one. i could go on and on...but, basically...i'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad....even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look at(she was sorta "butch" looking)....i can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit through...that compare to just how bad this flick was.....don"t waste your time on this one..........

once in a while it is good to see a really bad film like this, just so you know how decent an actor keanu reeves is by comparison. the premise of this story is good: teenagers go out on a boat, meteor lands in water, aliens kill teenagers. what's not to love about that, if you're into scream thrillers? but i should have known something was up when i read it was only 75 minutes long. i thought, "i hate judging movies by how long they are. who says a movie has to be 90 minutes?" but once i took the dvd home from bbuster, i was shocked at the awful production quality, acting, directing of this completely amateurish piece of garbage. the only reason i watched it to the end was because i don't have cable tv, and i already paid four bucks for it. however, there was one ray of light: the actor who played "chris" is actually decent, and far outclasses this dreck. first of all, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. then the aliens--the costumes seemed interesting (rubber suits) but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you don't really get to see them! and hardly any of the actors were convincing enough to suspend disbelief. finally, i must say that the dvd jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself, which felt like a rip-off, so beware of that when you rent other dvds. save your $4 and buy a pint of beer.

the kind of b-movies from the 1950's that were schlocky yet so much fun are to what predator island pays homage. filmed in connecticut, predator island is set on an island called with a lighthouse hell's beacon which is inhabited by only the couple who tends the lighthouse. in typical 1950's sci-fi fashion after a half dozen young adults crash their boat into the island's rocky shore hideous creatures from outer space invade the island after a meteor hits nearby. the creatures start both inhabiting the bodies of their victims as well as devouring them. lots of cursing and lame comebacks are the primary form of dialogue in this movie. it is so hokey that you just have to laugh at times. if you are looking for a movie that is stupid, but in a fun way, then this one fits the bill. interesting note: i appear in the film as a dead body in the far background of the final scene. during filming they needed about 50 extras, yet around 300 people showed up for the opportunity. they eventually used nearly 200 of them.

it's incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable. for those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe. simply because predator island contains none of this. it is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades. now i appreciate bad horror films, they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances. however, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the cult hall of fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination/creativity plus get some talent. oh, and a few extra bucks to put into your picture.one horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore. however, shock doesn't deliver for more than a few seconds. to really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters, some identifiable traits. i know, you're probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers, he's just stating an amateur remark. well, that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are.despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver lining. the performance by dan gordon as chris is splendid. he is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star. out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is reciting. he not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film. gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and overcoming a huge obstacle, that being the rest of the cast. dan gordon is going to be a star, hopefully sooner than later. that is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. the acting is pathetic. i know acting is hard work and stuff, but that's why it should be left to real actors. watching these people act is like watching michael j. fox perform brain surgery. it's shaky at best. one of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of dan gordon as chris. only dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting. the special effects in this movie were terrible. the worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. it looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box. sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top, but it didn't help. i suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single amiga computer from the late 80s.

the positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends. this film is amateurish in terms of direction, acting, in fact in every aspect. if the imdb are gonna allow filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films then that is a very sad thing. this film has a marketable premise but it is absolutely horrifically made.film is subjective so everyone has their own opinion. but this film is on a par with the work of ed wood, but without any of the charm. to think otherwise shows bad taste of the highest order.this is not a personal thing. i don't know anyone associated with the film. i'm just a film lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore i felt the need to address the balance and give a more accurate view of the film. it's very poorly made and the direction is below even film-making by the numbers. the acting is the worse ever committed to film. the best thing about this film is the poster and dvd cover art. beyond that it's not worth the time.

6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching, so let me redress the balance.if this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry. unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes i'll never see again and hopefully i'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own. whilst the idea behind the film is interesting, it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached. the student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won't care about what happens to them. the soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film, i kept waiting for captain markovic to twirl an imaginary moustache. some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination, but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting, poor script writing and patchy camera work. the budget may have been better spent sending the "actors" (and i use that term loosely)to acting classes or the thomas brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt. the fact that the mis-spellings were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production.i can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers, either that or they were watching a completely different film. i implore the thomas brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field, they will surely starve to death.

i rented this film for $5 and felt sorry i did it...i wouldn't give a 5c for it if i knew.this is the worse movie ever...none of the filming locations was in former yugoslavia,map at the beginning what the...???english actors are trying to speak serbian eg. pretending they are serbs and they did it terrible bad.my first language is serbian and i could not understand what they were mumling about.they drove a big jeep in a country where 3 sides (croats,serbs and muslims) are in war and they wrote on it peace 4 sarajevo???ha,ha, how stupid was that...don't know why english are making stupid films about war like this one...or even if they do why they are blaming serbs for everything,when there was another two sides in a war too.and we all know they were killing too,not just sitting and pretending innocent,so they should at least show the whole truth.this film also harrison's flowers,behind enemys lines,the hunting party and few others were total bullshit and that's proved eg the hunting party was biggest loser in 2007/08 spent 20 mil 4 it and they earned 800.000 ha,ha, what a crap...the truth will come out sooner or later.proud to be serb!!!

i'm sorry, elo fans, but i was disappointed with this concert at the cbs television city in los angeles. it's decent music-wise, but the presentation is simply boring - big-time. most of the songs sound the same and lead singer-writer jeff lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin. he has a pleasant voice, but he isn't much to watch. he just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. the songs all sound like 1970s-1980s bubblegum stuff: pleasant but not exciting.lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, rosie vela, but she isn't too animated, either. the only song - out of 23 - that creates any excitement is the last one: "roll over beethoven." now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them, this could have been a much better concert dvd.

wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me? nothing other than a questionable "sequel" to 8mm. it wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an american diplomat, david huxley, and his fiancée, tish harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest, hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, risa. the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. the mystery is solved when, in the end, tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.i didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all. the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. otherwise, its a totally different movie. it made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn't believe the words coming out of david's mouth the whole time. but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the "shocking" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this "hellish" sex debauchery. i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative.david was no heroic person throughout the film. you could guess he was the main problem long before the end. the actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting "respect." there were plot holes (how did david and richard finally impress tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) there were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character. the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath. nobody really dies. but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.go rent (and maybe buy) the original. it's one of joel schumacher's better and more original films. it has everything better about it from this film. i wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.

i'm so sorry, but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before. i thought that it will be a good film after 8mm. what a sell!!! there were nothing interesting in it, except the beautiful hungarian women. everything might be known forward. it's a miracle i didn't sleep trough all. i don't understand how might you let make it!! i'm so sorry, but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before. i thought that it will be a good film after 8mm. what a sell!!! there were nothing interesting in it, except the beautiful hungarian women. everything might be known forward. it's a miracle i didn't sleep trough all. i don't understand how might you let make it!!

i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series. after all, part 3 didn't measure up to part 2, and this one doesn't have daniel sawn. miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.the girl's part was pretty good. she's a lost teenager who needs direction. i find the plot a little hard to believe. that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr. miyagi, a man she just met. of course, he was a friend of her brother.i did appreciate the monastery. one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but i thought it was amusing. it showed that they know how to have some fun. now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to pop-music, that would have been another matter.probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid, nations trying to destroy each other is stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.i give this movie a 4 out of 10. sure, there were some things i liked about it. it wasn't as funny as part three, and no character could ever live up to sato in part 2. this movie has no re-watch value. i can't imagine watching it again, but it is worth seeing once.

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning david (johnathon schaech) and tish (lori heuring) are a couple in budapest, on business commitments and staying at a luxury hotel. one night, they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place, where they end up in a threesome. all is well, until david receives some negatives in the mail and he and tish end up being blackmailed. but when some people involved in the deception are found murdered, things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track down the woman who may hold the key to everything.whereas the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films, this straight to dvd sequel deals with the more wholesome (!!!) theme of threesomes and sleazy sex. it plays like a porn film, a cheap piece of titillation with plenty of hot t/a action going on. if this sounds like your idea of a good film, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store.this tries to copy the original film's dark and voyeuristic feel, but while it does a pretty good job of this, it still can't hold up to that of the original's. it has an apathetic story, with a dodgy narrative flow. and compared to cage, schaech comes across as interminably wooden.better than i thought it'd be, i suppose, and better than your average one of these dvd direct sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days, but really, haven't we seen enough? **

this is another one of those movies i just knew i would hate, but it ended up not being as bad as one would expect.it has a lot of t&a in it and even the dvd menu is chocked full of women's breast. the first few scenes of the movie has a lot of sex and nudity and i was beginning to think there would be no story at all just exploiting nudity for the sake of making money off a popular prequel 8mm.as i continued to watch there was just more sex and nudity and main characters that i could care less about, but then the story started to unfold and i started to see a point to it all, and it was a tad better.it is about a man who's fiancé is the daughter of an ambasador and they all have a promising future until nude photos of a menage a trois sex act shows up and blackmail is in the senders cards. the man and his fiancé must now get to the bottom of who sent the pics and how to shut them up.the movie first of all is nothing to do with part 1, it doesn't even have anything to do with 8mm's, its about a sex video though so i can see the similarities, as small as they may be.the acting is neither good, nor bad, its just nobodies playing parts anybody could do. the films production value is middle of the road and its pure drama yawn.i did enjoy going along for the ride getting to the bottom of the blackmailers motives. i was anticipating answers which is way more than i could say for the first one which i consider garbage. this movie has some nice twists too which are always welcomed.it's not great, and it is very slow started, but it does ultimately entertain. i wasn't on the edge of my seat and i won't rave to my friends that this is a must see, but hey if you watch a lot of movies and always seek something new, this might entertain you for 90 minutes.

i believe the production value is ok..probably deserves a 4/10 or 5/10.it's traditionally filmed,featuring good looking people with model quality and a little class..but the premise let me annoyed..a decent woman would do such dirt? i mean she is gonna marry a man who would have sex with another woman? and what's more serious she is also active in the behavior...... only in de laclos's mind....the film also have many aspects that makes eastern europeans seem immoralafter all, it's just movie, if it doesn't intend to degrade women in general, i will give one more point..but obviously, it doesconclusion: a nasty piece of crap with a little taste

why was this film made? what were the creators of this thinking?!?! the first 8mm film at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting. the first film was about the snuff film industry. this sequel is about... hold on... the porno industry!! yes, as if the snuff film industry, an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment, were at all in the same league with the adult film industry, an industry in which people film other people engaging in unstimulated sex acts and situations for eroticism. the idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea for this film alone is. it isn't helped by a lack of plot, character, acting, direction, script, logic, theme, or even sound design. this is a remarkably boring film that never once held my attention. literally nothing works. why would a mystery thriller film about the porno industry involving assassination and betrayal work anyway? i don't have much of an interest in adult films, but i certainly have watched them before. why would somebody make a film about the evils of it and that they would make it in a sequel to a film about snuff movies? i don't even know if there is an industry involved in snuff film making, but i hope it doesn't. the idea of a snuff film alone is horrific and only people who are truly sick and bad would be a part of it. i don't think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. i'm pretty sure that a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than to hurt and kill people. it is never okay to hurt another human being. the adult film industry isn't about hurting people. it's about creating films that are, to me, a diversion and a waste of time. what is this film trying to say? it doesn't work.

first off, the first thing that came to my mind after i finished this film last night was "why the title of 8mm 2?", because i saw the first one obviously, and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot? the only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot, because after you see the ending that i will not spoil, it just didn't make any sense.a diplomat and his fiancée are in hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area, she's very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome. but things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair, fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career, they pay off the guy who sent the pictures, the diplomat freaks out and "kills" the guy, leading into a murder case. he and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into.what could have been an alright thriller, turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie, which was sad. like i said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't fall for it. it's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense, but it's good for those nights alone, because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core.4/10

young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. sandy dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles i guess we'll never know. based on a book by richard miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman (whose work is static, at best). the narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of "the collector", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. even the film's best sequence (dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here, she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen. as such, the abrupt finale is maddening, and the overall results tepid. *1/2 from ****

the screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (this film is confusing, because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) i had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn't great, but this is telly, so it was fine. i don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. but having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? avoid this at all costs.the prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. the prologue was rushed, it wasn't clear what was happening, ie. the russian revolution was reduced to "some riots are happening in petersburg", with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. i know the basic history of the revolution, so i could fill in the details, "those pesky communists". the prologue is best ignored.this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. it sets up this premise in the asylum. it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. no. gone. the film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) it sets up a melodramatic romance, a love so strong, it'll believe anything she says. okay, a soppy romance. no, because it makes no sense. the love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally, sleazy) lunatic, bursting out in wild gestures. this also doesn't work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. they never got married and she returned to america. the love story collapses. despite there being plenty of love scenes, i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. i find rom-com romances more convincing, despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.it could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. no, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. the bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better film.the funniest thing to consider is what really happened. anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together. throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. none of this in the film either. there's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'one flew over the cuckoo's next/'twelve monkeys'-type informant. thankfully, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story.

the man with bogart's face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. it fails miserably for several reasons. first, sacchi, while looking reasonably like bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms, completely lacks any of bogart's charisma or acting ability. this is really apparent whenever sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of bogart's films. second, the film does not have the first rate character actors bogart was able to work with. there are no peter lorre's or sydney greenstreet's in this one, folks. sure we are treated to performances by victor buaeno, olivia hussey and george raft amongst others, but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). third, the attempts at "modern" humor all fall through. all of the underwear jokes, having marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though bogart would have), etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film. fourth, i've never heard a goofier theme song this side of mitchell. finally, the film's false reverence for bogart (and other classic actors work) is truly irritating. bogart almost *never* played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. he played complicated characters. this movie makes bogart out to be a trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. while this may have been true about some film characters, bogart's characters rarely fit that bill. it's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey, "good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl" crap with low production values.

this movie should have been called "the eyes of alexander", and they should have done away with the bogart concept altogether. the film started out with a lighthearted approach to bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller, where two palm size sapphires, purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of alexander the great, for him, and seen by him, right before his death. so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the greatest conquerer the world has ever known. being an expert on alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction, but it makes for a good movie anyway. so the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which i really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go to a movie in '79-'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience). there is a yacht named euridice (alexander's father's young wife), a man named alexander, philip, cleitus?, (it's been about 5 years since i've seen the film, so can't remember all the details), olympias, some street names, and many others. it was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an alexanderphile himself) put in. when all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. kind of a neat ending. what would have been more fun would be if they went the indiana jones way and had an action adventure. there were many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, or instance, the hand-annotated (by aristotle) version of the iliad that alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many journeys across asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). olivia hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress)is killed off way too early, and should have been the main actress throughout, not the girl from the momma's and the poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. if you can find this flick, it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see olivia hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on, but beyond that, i'd pass on it for something more entertaining.yours, nick

done in a mock-documentary style, late 60's subversives and supposed detractors of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice. upon sentencing for their wrong doings,there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern california desert at punishment park. in the 100 degree heat, the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an american flag for their freedom. us and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter. if the dissidents are captured it means prison.appearing in this pseudo-documentary: carmen argenziano, katherine quittner, mary ellen kleinhall, stan armsted, scott turner, patrick boland and kent foreman.

it doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a uk distributor, and then had to release it as a free dvd with a sunday newspaper. the distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the sunday newspaper couldn't, that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs.since it's a thriller about riddles, it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly, rather than the mumbling vinnie jones who appears to pronounce "riddle" as "riell". and it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. the plot is ludicrous: the lost charles dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, but so would a copy of herge's adventures of tintin, since the link between dickens and jones is more non-existent than tenuous. and we have the ridiculous premise that a would-be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered dickens manuscript, would take several days to read it, just so that flashbacks to dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie, as if they had some connection to it. which they don't. i mean, if you found a new dickens manuscript, wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it ? the film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since the sixth sense, but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence. if the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour, then revealing that vinnie jones is a robot might have been more acceptable. it might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish, but it isn't. and in several places it appears decidedly amateur: there's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique, but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts. consequently, you can see things changing at the edge of frame, when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame. a good rule in movie-making is: if you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else.the real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place.

i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film, 9.5? unfortunately it looks like i am not alone.the film, is slow and boring really, one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high.unfortunately, this was not the case, so when watching the film, and seeing the poor story and acting, i am left giving it a 3/10 score.vinnie jones is superb in lock stock, and also snatch, and he plays a great hard man, however, he should stick to this role. its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films, they just don't work.neither can he play lead actor, he plays better as supporting or otherwise. when he plays lead, his acting talents are too 'in view' and shown up as not really very good. mean machine is another good example of this.

the riddle as a concept is an interesting idea, but i'm afraid is miscast, vinnie if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch. in this movie vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer (greyhounds to be precise),who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 10-15 years his senior. i'm sorry vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish. trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the thames. he takes on the role of policeman, whilst the real police are bit part players, interceeding with flashbacks from charles dickens.when vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does'nt in this part need act tough, snarling at the camera in parts. if you watch the mean machine, he is perfectly cast, and believable and does a very decent performance. getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day, these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used. the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is inaudible at times, and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of vinnies love interest, she starts the film as a detecive, but quickly becomes the girlfriend.the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yet/not answered . strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie.vinnie, is slowly becoming britans steven segal, stick to the supporting actor role, your'e quite good at it.

committed doom and gloomer peter watkins goes slummin' across the pond to take on the american justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly. watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. talk about a revolution.in punishment park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across punishment park (death valley) and freedom. of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.punishment park has elements of kafka in setting as well as theme. trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of silent majority for a peaceful america) who snarl back. neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with america the other saying what's right with no one offering solutions for change. meanwhile the punishment park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. it kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.peter watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century scotland that still resonates. war game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. punishment park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( vietnam, kent state, the chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. but 35 years later the fever has subsided and punishment park with it's unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride.

i loved the first 15 minutes, and i loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this movie ultimately disappoints. even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor/oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks punch and believability, and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already.and for the record: despite rampant rumors to the contrary, this movie has never been banned in the us (i can't comment on the rumors of uk censorship, but i'm suspicious). hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing, and i am more than willing to believe the nixon government had some influence on this decision; however, the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business. as for the present, you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days.

the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic. that person must have been trained so well! if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy, i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy.

a really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow. the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good. they needed better make up,photography or something.it is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film. i liked the cast but i think the performances were rather bland. this is where the weakness of the director shows. perhaps if mrs. spielberg had mr. spielberg directing it would have been a much better film.

obviously, a number of agents didn't see beyond dollar signs when they signed up their clients for this 117-minute *omage* to the courtesan complex.sure, the film could have been alright, had the $1 million been left out of it. seriously. the amount of the check doesn't matter,prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant to imply "for richer for poorer, for pimping as in fidelity". picture the story otherwise, though: 2 kids, flat broke, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid. they collide with wealthy business man. kids' marriage is strained by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser. enter mr. tuxedo, oozing charm and stability -- a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock -- and with him the wife's temptation, tensions, suspense. whom will she choose? maybe, under those conditions, i could actually care. as-is, frankly, redford's selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character. a woman who will sell herself is just about what a guy deserves who will pimp out his wife. the indecent proposition makes the husband a total loser, deficient in every positive male characteristic, and makes the wife a cheap strumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman devoid of moral center and self-respect.all the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted on this film -- and it was an impressive amount -- couldn't save it from its splashy-but-too-trashy $1 million pitch line. if i see this turkey at one more bridal shower, i'm going to roast it! (or maybe cross it with titanic and pitch the tape in the ocean!)

i bought this movie at a thrift store. months before, my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we've seen. once i spotted the cassette, i knew i had to have it. i watched it that night. i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done. . . that's what drew me to it. i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through. i recognized gregory (the ice cream man), but i didn't recognize his name and i couldn't remember where i saw him. later, while watching the andy griffith show, clint howard (ice cream man) was featured as an extra since he is ron howard (opie taylor)'s brother. i saw the credits and i gasped. i turned to my mom, who was also watching the show, and said, "that's the ice cream man!!" she, too, gasped. this movie is great, but only for laughs and criticalness. it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick. if you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at low-budget movies, rent this video.

clint howard, brother of more talented ron, stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people. striving to be a movie that's of the 'so bad that it's good' variety, this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as 'so bad that it's...well...bad'. wheter it's the constant 'shoe ad' cinema, the pillow stuffed 'fat kid', or the sleep inducing 'horror' that soured me on the film, i don't know, all i know is i loathed the film (and this from a guy who has a soft spot for b-horror films). paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this, his only 'mainstream' film. a wise choice indeed as horrible acting, nonsense storyline, and ludicrous dialog are much much more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing. funnily enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity (another reason to steer clear) my grade: d-

a conversation about how jan-michael vincent is a lush led me to foolishly re-visit this mid-90s dtv entry. a kid is traumatized when he sees an ice cream man gunned down in the 1950s and he grows up to be a psycho ice cream man (clint howard). something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream. blah, blah, blah. director norman apstein (credited as paul norman) made a career of doing porn before this and went right back to it afterward. that is what you get for having all murders happen off screen. and for casting a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit. just cast a fat kid! also, there is a scene where vincent stoically reacts to a group of escaped loonies surrounding him. he was either totally drunk and was frightened for his life or the filmmakers captured his "have i really sunk this low?" shame full on. despite being low budget trash, this did line up a few good names including david naughton, olivia hussey, david warner and the people court's own doug llewelyn. how you can make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me.

the only good thing that this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice cream, minus the dead body parts in it. the movie is one of the most cheesy i've seen in a long time. when the "ice cream king" dies in the beginning, i was laughing so hard because the kid took the ice cream from him and started eating it. his mom asked him to say something and should should have said "leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so i can watch my acting career go down the drain at a young age." that seems about right for a line. then i wondered why the ice cream prince was behind the bars of his ice cream truck. was someone going to rob him of his twenty cents? i've never seen bars on a ice cream truck window. it seemed pretty stupid. you might as well forget about the acting because it is just awful. forget about this movie and go down to dairy queen and get an ice cream.

you can see that if the flick ain't directed by his brother, this is the best he can do. and sad to say, his best just doesn't cut it. "ice cream man" is a very bizarre horror film, that's a real blast to watch if you're in the right mood. in the wrong mood, it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones, so please, watch with caution.clint howard stars (does anything really star clint howard though?) as the "evil" "psychotic" "bizarre" (yes all in quotes, he's not quite any of these, but he's getting close) ice cream man, who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them. ick.anyway, the plot's really just an excuse to show of the...well, the...um, well it's a plot. oh wait, i know! it's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos! there's jan michael vincent and lee majors ii (the sequel?) as cops tracking the elusive man o' ice cream. and even doug lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk.even better than that, are some of the bizarre goofs in the film. i really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy "fat" kid of the group, they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes. and the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man. who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man? then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene, in which jan michael vincent's acting ranges from mildly interested, to bored beyond the state of consciousness. these are the cops who also scour the ice cream man's place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck (where, of course, the various bodies and such are kept). oh well, better luck next time troops.howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him. it's all just plain dumb. and fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of the pumaman or gymkata. you'll have a good laugh with the right sense of humor. i love that one.

technically speaking, this movie sucks...lol. however, it's also hilarious. whether or not it's intentionally funny i don't know. horrible in every aspect, it also is the only movie i know of that has 1) a fat kid being played by a slim actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive 30-something actress playing a character who's supposed to be in her late 60's, and 3) the most compliments for plastic yard daisies ever. don't take this film seriously, just watch it for laughs....a great party movie.

i picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a jewish comedy focus - something i had not seen before. i approached this film with an open mind, and was interested in the way it began. the opening is well put together, and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh, and this is good.however, the humor soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and strained, and i realized i was no longer enjoying the film. i have tried to avoid saying this, but the movie became rather "cheap" - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up, but it didn't. i confess that i may have missed some of the humour, not being jewish myself, and having little experience with jewish culture. however, considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film, it's unlikely i missed much.the idea is a good one, and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through. i wish i could give the movie a higher rating, but strictly speaking it would have been better as a tv series or as a series of skits. there was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full-length movie.one thing to say about the casting - the lead role looked as if it had been designed with ben stiller in mind, but i don't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it.

i saw the *star* of this movie on the daily show, and thought i might tune in (the movie premiered on comedy central, then went into theaters). oh vey!this makes "shakes the clown" look like "citizen kane"! avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. not one laugh, not even a grin. this movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes burst like the last remants of "raiders". i can't even think of a worse movie, be it "manos" or "ishtar". as the pythons beckoned, run away, run away! why did anyone green light this unless they used their own money? the horror is that there is not one good line, not one good joke, and only one bad thing...the making of this movie.i feel that, if made properly, this would have been hilarious. as it is, i need a new pancreas for retching so loud. damn anyone involved in this travesty.

this film is dreadful. it has absolutely zero laughs. hebrew hammer (adam goldberg) sets out to save hannukah from evil santa (andy dick). perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot, in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise. while there are some (far and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laboured, hackneyed and ultimately, mindlessly boring. this despite the fact that goldberg, dick and greer (hammer's client/love interest) all have quite considerable screen presence. despite being played for what might be described as whacky over-the-top gags, this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck. do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note- the music was good..!)

the title is a misnomer:the movie depicts barely one year of the so-called "divin marquis" .twas a hard time for him 'cause he was threatened by the guillotine :the quiet joys of the reign of terror .historically speaking,the background is rather sketchy: "the fête de l'et re supreme",robespierre's failed attempt to create a secular religion,his downfall ,a heaven sent opportunity for showing doctor guillotin's sinister machine at work (full speed).as far as sade is concerned ,it's a downright mediocre affair :he's waiting in a former nunnery with other nobles ,a golden cage if you compare it to ,say,marie-antoinette's or scientist lavoisier's fates,and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death,love and other trivia.there's the obligatory "daring" scene but you've got to be patient because it's a long time before it comes on the screen.and anyway ,by today's standards ,can we call that risqué? cy enfield's "de sade" ,which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of the imdb ,is at least entertaining ,and keir dullea was a more credible marquis than the aging auteuil.and it featured john huston.

this is an extremely competent movie technically. the camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well--especially the fine acting by daniel auteuil as the marquis. i really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film. instead, i was a bit annoyed by the way the marquis was portrayed, as it didn't seem all that honest and seems to be a very revisionistic view of history. in fact, in recent years, the marquis has undergone a bit of a transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight, not the fat sado-masochist rapist he really was. in a way, this is highly reminiscent of the whitewash given in the people versus larry flint--where these men are elevated to hero status. even if you don't think that the marquis' perversions weren't all that bad (they included rapes and extreme violence), his portrayal in this film as a "sexual social worker" in this prison seems pretty silly. instead of the violent and selfish sade, he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality. what a nice and kind man. in fact, now that i think about it, this performance reminds me of the man maurice chavalier played in gigi (but without the singing)--a cute older man who loves the ladies. i strongly doubt the real-life marquis de sade would have recognized this character at all!the film, surprisingly, doesn't have a lot of nudity, though what it does show is extremely explicit. only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama. it's very well-made and pretty entertaining--just not all that truthful. the director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the dvd i watched. so go ahead and see the film if you'd like--understanding it just isn't very good historically. during the 18th century, sexual libertines were quite accepted in france as they were pretty broad-minded, so despite what the movie implies it wasn't sex that was the issue, it was the violence and rape that was (and still is) the problem.

baby boom was bad enough, basically making a series of every straight mans nightmare is worse. yeah watched a few always made me feel better after a bad day, it reminded me it could be worse. guy was rich successful, single(smart man), and dating celebs from singers to actresses, then his screw up of a cousin dumps his biggest mistake on him. in reality it would have been straight to foster care i'm sure, this was definitely a chic series. oh and what's all the wining about the baby change, most the time it's probably a doll besides at that age it's nothing more than a prop anyways.any case i'm glad it didn't last more than a year.

at the least some of the sitcoms that churn endlessly out of the us are honestly bad. this junk, however, portrays a "heart warming" parenty side to a clothes horse. acting laughably "learnt" with glances and phrases delivered in the "i'm so important and thin and beautiful" fashion. in the episode i just sat agog through, someone's "job" was at risk simply because a colleague had "placed" a phone call, slagging her capabilities off ... !! really, this is the lowest of the low. what kind of damage does this foist on the watching masses, seeing only glitzy glam-puss people parading around "working". utterly sick making. when the titles rolled, i thought, oh well, it provided jobs for the boys. you know who you are.

i'm at a loss. this entire movie made absolutely no sense. it was like watching a soderburg film for football. the camera cutting, the pace, all so copied. i thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. yes, we all know southerners like football and beauty pageants. must we be inundated with it as an audience? i watched because of lee and jay. i was expecting young talent assembled in the style of dead poet's society or similar to remember the titans. i was completely put off by the film. you didn't get the characters. it was character driven, but you didn't understand anyone's motivations or their actions for the most part. the one kid who's mom is obsessed with him being a football player. why is he so silent? what's his deal? did we really need the scene with him "proving" his heterosexuality? why should we care? the movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. it just made no sense. and why show a movie about a team that lost? i know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their "conceivable" problems, darnit. we got nothing. we got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer (lee). why didn't you follow that story? what were we to get out of this one? the movie led you along, but didn't lead you anywhere. i just felt like something was missing. it felt like a bad genetic cross between varsity blues and remember the titans. at least those two movies led you somewhere. friday night lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie. the actor who played him was great. you were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. they made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why make sure we get his issues? and the other team in the play-offs...are we to believe those are high school teens? those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s. who were they trying to kid? i know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. i liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. nothing pieced together. the characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was showcased. it was all just a mess. not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee.

having been born and raised in odessa, and having graduated from the "other" high school in the late 70's, odessa high school, i had mixed emotions about this movie. i no longer live in odessa, but will always be a texan at heart. i didn't like the way that this town of 80,000 plus was portrayed as a dirt poor small town. if i'm wrong about this, please feel free to correct me, but i believe ohs also plays in the town stadium, and the "home of the permian panthers" sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at permian. i would have liked to have seen a little acknowledgment about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year, ohs vs permian. i am curious why the outcome of the game was altered though, i think it would have been just as dramatic if the real outcome was portrayed. overall, the movie was okay, made me a little homesick, remembering the "good old days" of mojo.

i tried. lord help me, how i tried. but there are just some people almost incapable of creating quality. brett ratner, uwe boll, britney spears, and asylum. to their credit "the 9/11 commission report" seems like an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and movie making. but for all intents and purposes, it comes off as another truly film in their gallery. at the opening, the disclaimer notifies audiences that all the names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. a man named mussaui attempts to learn how to fly a plane. with a stone cold grimace that would instantly make anyone uneasy, this "undercover" agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer. and you have to wonder, not how he was able to get into this program so easily, but on how these people didn't even ask questions; because this scene is so far-fetched in its presentation, and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top. and you can see that director scott attempts to mimic paul greengrass with a bright grainy photography that's followed by an awfully dizzying and irritating hand-held direction that, throughout the entire film, attempts to take off from greengrass's gung-ho guerrilla film-making techniques. you can sense scott emulating greengrass's technique for realism, but it becomes rather lame-brained halfway in. meanwhile the film comes off less a "traffic" take off, and more a take off on "law & order" in which we'll have the disclaimer notifying us the names have been changed, the logo almost reminiscent of the "law & order" logo, and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their chests and discussing politics.neither of which are ever as compelling as it tries to be. and then when the film seems as if its attempting to be an adult drama, scott relies on his old failsafe, the sex scene. scott's new film looks like it really wants to be thought of as a low budget "munich" but it's not, and it manages to be underwhelming on every such occasion possible. "the 9/11 commission report" falls flat, and that's because its limited in its attempts to imitate other films.while i appreciate the ambition inherent behind the camera, this new perspective of the events leading up to 9/11 is flat, and dull. hard as it may try to be a low-budget "munich" it's only really as entertaining as a normal dolph lundgren film you'd find on cinemax.

i rented the dvd in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. but it's pretty much just more terror-tainment.while the film may present some info from the report in the drama, you're taking the word of the producers - there's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. not one.the acting, all around, is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotypes of 'hot shot' bitchy foul mouthed government agents, each thinking they know more than everyone else. there may be some truth to it, but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it.imdb's user community ratings & comments tend to be more right than wrong, and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can.i wish i had on this one.

i was so let down by this film. the tag line was something like 'the story of a girls sexual awakening'. you can only imagine how disappointed i was. i was seventeen at the time and i took my girlfriend to see it. i thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend gagging for it. sadly that was not the case. i guess we just weren't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we just didn't possess at the time. i'm not so sure i possess it now, and i have long since parted company with that particular girlfriend (pity really... my first love). we left the cinema half way through the film, my friend, who should have known better, stayed for the whole thing. i still got the required result with my girlfriend, the film just didn't help much. it would be interesting to see it again so that i can make a more informed critique, though i feel the experience has left me scarred for life.

it's dreadful, but ...cat stevens fans are given the opportunity to see the woman who inspired the lovely song "lady d'arbanville" on his album "mona bone jakon", before cat turned into a fatwa-supporting religious zealot.

when it was released this film caused a sensation. i watched it and was thrilled. beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography. his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie. today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. there is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. actually nothing happens. it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. and this gets so boring after a while. i even didn't watch the whole thing the second time, for i fell vast asleep. that is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. and you will never become addicted to it!back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10

it is not generally my practice to review movies that i dislike to any great degree. however, one or two times a year, i temporarily set aside my rule to only comment on things i like to give a word of warning. i find it more enjoyable to comment on something i like and boost it than i do shooting at bad movies. but some "movies" cry out for the razor.bilitis is one of them. the cinematography isn't the only aspect that is blurry and out of focus here. an almost indiscernible plot (certainly incoherent, if there even is one) bad acting, cheesy script and awful pacing. those are its major problems.understand, i firmly believe that not all movies are created equal and films should be judged according to their category. it is not reasonable to judge, say, beach blanket bingo against gone with the wind. i judge bilitis against other movies in its weight class. measured against movies like emmanuelle or secrets of a chambermaid, it comes off very badly indeed. even eye-candy has to be entertaining and bilitis most definitely is not.

this movie could have been oh so much better. it is a beautiful story set in very trying times, and yet it was so poorly executed. the leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs, and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film. although at times their dialogue seems stilted and forced. the directing could have been more concise. the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers, who took a good story and made it tedious. in short, there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours.

robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him. this may work if you buy into the "u-s-a! number one!" mentality but story wise nothing much happens. quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something, and says it sincerely. it just doesn't pack enough emotional punch.

one of the latest (disaster) movies from york entertainment, "el chupacabra" excels in making its viewer want to die after having wasted two hours watching it. this movie appears to have been filmed with a spare camcorder normally used for birthday parties. the only reason i could tell that it wasn't was because of certain scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame.just about every aspect of cinema is plagued by this movie, and i'm sure that it has set the film industry back another ten years. the actors are borderline retarded, often pausing while they wait for the off-screen cue-card to change. the actor that plays navarro not only slurs and skips word in his dialogue, but stumbles through the swiss-cheese plot line with a squinting and confounded look on his face. other actors break the forth wall and overall show the acting skill of a twelve-year old kid doing a science project in his backyard.my friends and i purposefully search out the worst possible movies, and this one gave us more than we bargained for. the humorous parts are unfunny and the rest is riddled with horrible clichés and plot holes. as one friend so humbly put it, this movie is the aborted fetus of the industry. i would highly suggest this film for people like me that purposely search for these movies, but for all others, beware!

ok, so i have recently been collecting a lot of vipco and hardgore titles on dvd and i have to say that this one is one of the most disappointing ones. a more recent film compared to other titles in the hardgore catalogue this was a straight to dvd release. i've always been interested in the myth of el chokeberry ever since i saw a documentary on it as a teenager. however this film is a terrible let down shot on tacky dv the storyline and acting are terrible, it took me three goes to watch this film all the way through. while cheap 80's and 90's horror films are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy this film is not.check out some other titles in the hardgore series first, boneyard for example is older but much much better.

you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? el chupacabra is it. "manos:the hands of fate" is the worst movie of all time, but el chupacabra certainly is the worst movie of this century. it also has to have the distinction of having the absolute worst leading actor ever. eric alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never done another film other than el chupacabra, gee - i wonder why.apparently the monster is attacking people, but everyone that is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid. and, there are no cops at all in this town just two idiot detectives - hello! cops show up on the scene of homicides first, then the detectives come! and, apparently the monster only attacks in one person's backyard, and some deserted area by the docks. or...thats the only places the filmmakers could get access to film.this 'film' is the reason why imdb must allow us to give negative stars. this easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. they should allow a 0 rating.

the back of my dvd describes the plot of "el chucabra":after his capture in the wilderness,the legendary bloodthirsty creature chupacabra escapes into the city creating mayhem and panic.as they pursue the deadly beast,an animal control officer and scientist dr starlina davide realize that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan is also tracking the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolical dr goodspeed.this putrid horror flick is somewhat amusing,if you watch it under the influence of alcohol.the script is completely silly,the acting is wooden beyond belief and the direction is amateurish.two rubber chupacabra suits are easily the best thing about this movie.3 out of 10 and that's being extremely kind.

this film did entertain me with lots of laughs at the actors who kept the film moving along in all types of crazy directions. if you like suggestive language and sexy looking gals they were all in the picture and gals and guys all looking burned out before they even graduate from high school. there is one scene where the teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then proceed to throw it out into a lake or ocean, which is repeated over and over again. there is no horror to this film except the word horrible for the entire picture and arnold who plays a plastic cop is really one sick character. please don't waste your time viewing this film.

shrieker is a full moon production. i knew what to expect (very little quality) but i didn't expect this to be as painful as shrieker was to watch.it's just awful. bad acting, confusing script and direction. annoying characters i wanted to kill. the whole thing was probably made in one week. i've seen episodes of charmed that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie.it has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen. it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute. watching a movie shouldn't be this much hard work.

the best thing about shrieker is the dialogue. like scream and i know what you did last summer, this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions. unfortunately, shrieker is just boring. the plot is your basic ten little indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects/victims. you know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero(ine) is left to defeat the evil. and this is exactly what happens. absolutely no surprises and no tension. production values and acting were ok, but i had no motivation to watch to the end (although i did) because i already knew how the end scene would play out. the ending did surprise me a bit, because it managed to fizzle out, literally, instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end.

i don't believe i've seen a horror movie this bad since...hell, i don't believe i've ever seen a horror movie this bad. the acting alone was enough to make one cringe. the bad acting went way beyond horror film cheesy. it was just plain awful. and did you check out those god awful special effects? when the demon (which looked more like a cheaply constructed puppet) came out of the wall i couldn't tell if i was supposed to be frightened, or laughing my ass off. as a huge fan of the horror genre, this film was more than mildly disappointing. i couldn't help but notice the director is from portland, or, which just happens to be my own hometown. i must say i'm deeply ashamed. if i could, i'd give this film a negative 500.

sometimes full moon makes entertaining movies. this isn't one of them. full moon is like a low-key troma. their movies aren't as violent or off the wall, but they're usually just as devoid of talent. the acting in this movie isn't terrible but the script is pretty bad, and overall it's pretty boring and it doesn't even contain any nudity (like many full moon movies) to somewhat redeem it. skip this one, and go rent "head of the family".

a tough sell: british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud, bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged, blustery, brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether. the actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of "king lear" (during an air raid!), yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation. based on the waning years of actor donald wolfit, whose dresser was ronald harwood, this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians. unfortunately, albert finney (at this point in his career, not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; finney (and oscar-nominated director peter yates) cannot modulate sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us, so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice, and in the next he's curiously falling apart. with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude, one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future), yet servant tom courtenay prods and badgers and goads finney to carry on rather than rest. courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor), is far more attuned to his role, and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film. these two, thankfully, do not peck at each other's heads, and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act); but, without a juxtaposition of servant vs. celebrity, there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism, the hint at what once was. *1/2 from ****

trite and unoriginal. it's like someone watched immortal beloved and amadeus and decided to mix them together and, in the process, steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one. as with most historical movies nowadays, there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story, which is understandable for the most part. for example, during the remaining days of beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them. that, of course, would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen. the script, although filled with some quotable lines, doesn't quite capture the feel of that time period and, coupled with some bad acting, seems rather contemporary. diane kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft. ed harris doesn't work for me as beethoven and i mostly blame gary oldman for that. overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life. better just find yourself a copy of immortal beloved.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews

awful!despite the good performance of ed harris, diane kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the movie is by far the worst i saw about a composer, and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. i agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography, that otherwise couldn't be so "charming". this was done in amadeus with best results, but this b copy here is a flaw. beethoven had a strong personality, but was a sensible artist. here in this movie however, he looks much more as mike tyson! i wonder also, whether despite his deafness, he heard all the whisperings in the last scenes (may be a cochlear implant?). i prefer to listen to the ninth on a cd with some nice maestro. today most of them conduct modern wagnerian orchestras. by the way: i gave amadeus 10/10!

i expected so much more than what i received from watching this movie. it is not that i object to literary license, (if that is what it should be called) especially when there is no overt attempt to say "based on a true story." but this movie is about beethoven -- a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and i expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements. this movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint.my assumption (because i had not researched the movie at all) was that it was true. half way through, i stopped the movie to look it up on imdb. the rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. i was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story. to enjoy this movie, i was required to recognize it as a fantasy, a "what if it was like this" story. the movie lacked this honest disclaimer.what disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony. the very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity. i ended up doubting anything was true to history other than ludwig van beethoven and his relationship with karl van beethoven.i really enjoyed the performance of ed harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that i give it a 3/10.those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is, for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.

yes, i realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie "copying amadeus", but it cannot be said enough. scenes seemed to have been lifted directly from milos forman's script with only superficial changes. you can expect to see:-the maestro's arrogant scene ("i am the voice of god. everything else is meaningless!")-the maestro making fun of the mediocre composer's work (complete with raspberries & simulated flatulence, just like in amadeus)-the mediocre composer's dialogue with god ("why do you instill me with music but deny me the ability to compose?")-the musical dictation from the deathbed scene ("common time. begin with the violins... cough cough")-and the list goes on...the problem is even worse. not only were these scenes shamelessly copied, they weren't even done very well. jeepers, if you're going to rip off an original, at least you should try to improve upon it in your own creative way.no wait, there's something even worse than that. it's the fact that the director tried to beat the story of mozart into the story of beethoven. folks, beethoven was not a crass, vulgar slob the way this movie portrays him. furthermore, beethoven was not a babbling idiot who takes pointers from his copyist, a 23 year old music student. unfortunately, films like this are responsible for butchering history.and another thing, beethoven (in real life) never called it the "moonlight sonata" the way he does in the movie. that name was given by a confused critic some years after beethoven died, and unfortunately it stuck. but beethoven's original title was "quasi una fantasia".and another thing, when beethoven (in the movie) yells "b-flat! b-flat! b-flat!" and hits the note on the piano, he's hitting a white key!and another thinggg!!! beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th symphony. this movie shows him as having barely a minor disability (saying "what?" every other line, just enough to be annoying).aaand!! annnother!!! thingggg...!! the american accents...! oh never mind. just... never mind. i've wasted enough time on this already. go see "amadeus" again. then, if you want to see an interesting biopic on the life of beethoven see "immortal beloved" which takes poetic liberties, but at least they're interesting ideas. lastly, if you want to see something on the lighter side, check out "impromptu", a film about chopin. but aside from those three, i've never seen a good homage to a classical composer.

this film is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. ed harris is awful. how could you cast an actor built like rambo to play the "maestro"? he shows no credibility at all and overplays beethoven. most of all, long hairs doesn't look good at all on his head. the main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character. the camera shots are cheesy and too conventional. the lights are to close of the characters feelings. bad casting and cheap direction. too bad! the only scene that worth the movie is when beeth (i hope you don't care that i call him trough his nickname?) is turning the girl's song to a joke. any way, i hope that harris could find his way back to true movie where he can really shows his hairless talent.

about your terrible movie copying beethoven. as a professional musician it's my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and beethoven is one of my favorites. when hungarians and americans meet, it's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible. you proved it in your terrible b-movie. the only thing that carries the movie is the music. of course you didn't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the tackacs quartet, but ok i have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you've made. it starts of with the dying deaf beethoven who perfectly understands anna who is merely whispering. beethoven's hearing during the movie get's better by the minute, but that must be because of some vague divine thing. then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic "eyes wide shut" double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious anna and the crying nephew in the end (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my god what a performance). and as culmination the rip-off from amadeus, with beethoven dictating music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand. of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least, but i can assure you that beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason. this so called homage is blasphemy and i am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it's about my favorite subject. ed harris and others, you cannot comprehend the greatness of beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing. that's the trouble with you americans: you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. yeah we can do it anyway! remember that a good product comes with hard labor, talent, devotion and professionalism. all these you creators of copying beethoven lack. see you in kindergarten.

i made a big mistake going to see this film. that's the lottery of going to see films i guess. after five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and i fought quite hard to stay in my seat - the old "lose two hours of your life" kind of feeling.the fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning the whole "historical accuracy" thread of reviews, the script is achingly, painful, bad.the first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible, real, plot development. instead, it lurched from from one undramatic "dramatic" event to the next. having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. and that whole walking off into the sunset through the long-grass field at the end, what the hell was that about? not even the excellent ed harris could save this one. you could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter. the most fabulously awful one was, for no apparent reason, he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment, she looks up, it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind-a lighting (or am i dreaming), and he says, with authority in his voice, "wash me." and she gets up and washes him, with a sponge. "wash me" wtf? that's hilarious.and then there was the music. the long extended session when it was just beethoven conducting and the 9th symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting, waiting, standing there silently for what seems like forever. and then, finally, launching into enormous sound. it was spine-chillingly wonderful and dare i say it, it brought tears to my eyes.so that is where the film picked up two stars. the only part of the film where beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say.and i believed him.

i find myself alarmed that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism. the many similarities, both structurally and literally, with 'amadeus' aside the 'copying beethoven' deliberately chooses the easy path by putting audience before art. and therefore denying the world a discerning, intelligent and creative work.now consider the following: is it not possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony may actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and equally so in a dramatic telling? beethoven was completely deaf by the writing of the symphony  isn't that more interesting? how was the symphony conducted? wouldn't it be great to know? so ask yourself, what possible motivation could a filmmaker have for introducing a woman as the copyist? if there was a copyist, he would certainly be a man. what was his story? (please try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a woman composer). fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve a writers purpose. for those who find themselves comparing and justifying the invention of anna holtz with the invention of salieri's claim to have murdered mozart in 'amadeus', consider that he confessing to a priest in a lunatic asylum (schaffer uses this device to great affect in the film). 'copying beethoven' may have worked if anna was a figment of ludwig's fevered imagination. but we are meant to believe she is 'possible'... yes and that strauss was assisted by aliens.most of the positive reviews i've read here so far are often expressions of a desire for the film to be good; almost a deliberate amnesia. remembering the film for what you wish it to be rather than what it is.for those who believe that fantasy justifies the means then consider you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events but also sacrificing the truth for the sake of a triviality.finally, a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you. ed harris is not good as ludwig van beethoven. does that shock you? he looks awkward throughout the film, much like an actor dressed up, but off set and standing at the catering table. most of his lines are said as cues rather than replies to anna holtz's lines (i.e. he is not listening to the actor). he is quite clearly an actor masquerading as the character rather than being the character.really, how many times does beethoven have to roll in his grave before we get it right? just ask yourself, would ludwig approve?

let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff, more on the enjoyment side of life: i love what james woods can do and has done, and i always love melanie griffith, and natasha wagner was very good in this awful, miserable, stinking "true crime" essay.whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves. truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they don't do "junk" or any drugs before going on a score ( job ).the james woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film, and then the script fell apart completely. he turns into a raging, alcoholic lunatic .... nice work for a high-strung guy like woods, maybe, but not in the least bit believable.most criminals are lazy. if they wanted to work they would work.these people in this film are beautiful, self-indulgent, drug-addled narcissistic losers. they couldn't pull off a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid ( as happens in the early scenes of this "dog" ), keeps him beat down and doesn't let him up. ever.how many ways did i find to hate this film ? many. even totally vulgar people -- like most sneak thieves and junkies -- have a larger vocabulary than these cretins. and the 'rip-off' scenes with the neo-nazi bikers ? puhlease. all rednecks ain't neo-nazis and those who are neo-nazi speed dealers just ain't that dumb !!this film earned a two because natasha wagner was extremely good in her role as rose and because melanie griffith still has 'that something special,' or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film. i'm not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they'd all be dead or in jail by act 2, scene 1. watching a lousy zombie movie would be time better spent than this .... thing ... and i hate zombies.

great piece of fiction played as if factual. tonight i was looking at the birdman of alcatraz. robert stoud was not a model meek prisoner and he was in jail because he was pimping and a customer did not pay up. once he got into jail he was so uncontrollable he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. killed a few people in prison too. this movie reminds me of the birdman of alcatraz but even worse. robert stroud did write books and he did contribute to society in someway. and the boa had some hints of strouds lunacy. but this guy henry young who murder in the first is suppose to be about was a a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more then one robbery. he wasn't some poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store which just happened to be a post office and took some money. this man was a hard core criminal. he also killed a person 3 years before he went to alcatraz. he killed another person in jail not because of the solitary confinement which ended over a year before the murder. the real story of his life would of been more interesting. they did not even get the warden thing right. you can't be a warden in 3 different prisons at the same time. and by all accounts the warden in the movie was a pretty stand up guy as wardens go. plus if my math is right the warden played by karl malden in the boa is suppose to be the same warden in this movie. oh boy. not only that, in this movie we are to think poor henry committed suicide. and he wrote the word victory. not true..he might be alive right now. he was sent to springfield where robert stroud was also a medical center prison then walla walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped parole in 1972, never to be found. maybe he is hanging out with that cb cooper guy who jumped out that airplane in washington state after committing a bank robbery lol. now the acting was very good. kevin bacon is in that class of actors which include jeff bridges and dennis quaid, the vastly underrated actors club. gary oldman well they just might of made-up the warden part so he could play it because he was great. christian slater still somehow sounds like jack nicholson, i am not sure if that is a good thing or not. bacons wife kyra sedgwick was in the movie i think just because she is his wife. i like her though but not in this flick. for some reason i felt this movie when it first came out was suppose to be a special project for kevin bacon. i feel he could of taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system, there sure is enough of them and spread some light on their plight. other then picking a psychopath to show as a victim.

i'm always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good credentials, but in this case the film's neglect appears justified. evidently based on some actual incidents during wwii, the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. one very likely reason is that - in the print i saw on tcm, anyway - none of the scenes where the germans talked among themselves were given titles. this interesting directorial concept - to let the non-german speaking viewer just guess from "context" what the germans are saying to each other - is, in my book, an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out. also, the way the movie begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. brian keith is pretty good here, but the reputations of "the great escape" and "stalag 17" will not be challenged by this flick.

as usual, leader leo gorcey (as slip mahoney) and "the bowery boys" are hard-pressed for cash. after unsuccessfully trying to sell their old jalopy, the lads look for help at the local bank. there, hapless huntz hall (as sach) has his picture taken by pretty photographer teala loring (as cathy smith). but, since the shot was snapped during a robbery, it makes mr. hall look like the prime suspect. with pals bobby jordan (as bobby), william "billy" benedict (as whitey), and david gorcey (as chuck); mr. gorcey wants to clear hall, and collect the $1,000 reward money. "bowery bombshell" goes through the motions, with ms. loring a main strength.**** bowery bombshell (7/20/46) phil karlson ~ leo gorcey, huntz hall, teala loring, bobby jordan

the movie was awful. the production company should be required to pay a fine for wasting electricity transmitting this nonsense.there were too many holes in the plot. why would the doj send a killer out to assassinate a world leader? if they weren't the doj, why would they send someone they thought would not do the job? to quote butch cassidy, "who are those guys?" apparently, the director does not know either because he never told us.the characters were unbelievable. they did not behave in any way that seemed to fit who they allegedly were. with the exception of the doctor, none of the characters were particularly compelling or likeable.if you want to waste money on the electricity required to watch this movie, feel free. otherwise, run the opposite direction.

the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be. a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed, he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. morning blessings are recited, but only the ones gitai finds controversial. the rest are conveniently omitted. then while in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife good morning!! this is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home, let alone a chassidic home. amos gittai is not interested in accurately portraying chassidic life. he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films. the mikka (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a chassidic wedding. i have many problems with the chassidic way of life, but i have no use for amos gittai's commentary on these issues. he would have you think that the chassidim are all dense comformists with severe bouts of depression. i may not agree with the chassidic lifestyle, but i acknowledge that chassidic life has many layers. amos gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubborness and is therefore, incapable of portraying an accurate depiciton of chassidic life. aside from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of chassidic life, gitai fails in other aspects as well. the plot is full of holes, the dialogue loaded with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times powerfull was too often loaded with melodrama. the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for. watch if you must, but be warned. if you want to learn about chassidic life go to the communities and talk to chassidim. do not rely on gittai's film!

i don't know what chasidik movement was this film about?i saw this film a year ago.i am an orthodox woman, living in an orthodox chasidic? community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie!it's so far away from the reality, it's scary ! the director could at least hire a chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation, before making a "realistic" movie about ultra -orthodoxs! for example meir's davening (morning prayers)! or a jewish wedding, or a mikveh ( ritual bath ) customs.movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies..but it's not them that bothered me. it's the spiritual side. orthodoxs are portrayed next to taliban. woman are powerless, while men are the ultimate rulers ! please!no one can force a jewish girl to the chuppa against her will ! we ,orthodoxs,also, live by the law (halacha ) which clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife.no beating and no raping,also!and no man ( even rabbi)is allowed to peak at the woman in the mikveh.and balanit is not to place a hand over woman's head,while she's taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time! director was clearly trying to bash ultra orthodoxs ! but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner?love story? cute ! but not credible.dialogs are long and boring.the ending sucked totally.for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending ,for all that sitting i felt i deserved it! obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews, or for non- jews, perhaps..(look at those fundamentalist, they are so evil and mean...)and they succeed! long thing short: was hoping for a nice europien (kane level ) movie, got instead a tradition bashing, unrealistic,mistakenly guiding junk. i mean , today,we live in a time of a free will as never before. everyone has a right to choose. malka chose a rock singer.rivka made her choice.meir made his. many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these days.because,in this mad world religion might be a nice gateway !

my mother told me not to go to see "kadosh" -- but who ever listens to one's mother? i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater, so i checked with card-carrying feminists the next day. no, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement, painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban.while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra-orthodox messianists, it is so nasty as to be unbelievable (plus that the non-fanatic orthodox rock-'n'-roller(!) one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy--even in israel that must be fantasy).the theater was quite crowded, so there's a pent-up curiosity to see israeli movies; too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution. this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies. (originally written 4/29/2000)

the film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice. never will a jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. although the concept exists in jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place. childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as depicted in the film. they are treated with extreme sensitivity. in fact, many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce.the depiction of yosef, a horrible human being, is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. in reality, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society. both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable.it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie (by someone who is personally biased against a community). i have always thought that it is only the orthodox, because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle, who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies.

as a writer and a lapsed orthodox jewish woman, i was let down tremendously by this movie. the dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful, the characters, too engaged with lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the stunningly melodramatic, aren't allowed to expand into genuinely textured individuals. the one-trick musical score tries to make up for the blandness, swooping portentously into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of protracted catatonia.like an adolescent revolutionary on a self-righteous tirade, this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation--patriarchy is wrong--and thoroughly squanders its energies, hammering on this point. the resultant artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.

here is a film which clearly banks on being marketed as exotica to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matter.an attempted hybrid of fiction and document, "kadosh" clumsily falls in between the chairs. as a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor insightful. to realize its sloppy handling of detail, one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his t'filin. more generally, the tedious rote-style presentation of details (in this case of jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of a manual, not of a good documentary; the latter should provide an organizing principle (a gestalt, if you will) for the viewer, so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed. this clearly does not happen here, as ultra-orthodox ritual is being made even more enigmatic. the director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film's release campaign; cinematically, however, this is a severe case of stuttering. as a fiction-feature, on the other hand, it suffers from flatness of character, simplicity of plot and bluntness of message. at some points i felt i was watching a cartoon. (e.g. the wedding night consummation scene - without going in detail into angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex, savage as it may be.)there are no subtleties in this film. the clever manipulation of hints, stimulating the viewer's imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text, which i believe is a mark of a good feature, is completely absent. on the contrary: watching the movie i felt, at times, as being force-fed again and again with the same already chewed-up and way-too-obvious content. it is, indeed, as director gitai himself put it in an interview, an architectural "shifting objects in space", and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and advancing the plot on its appropriate and predictable track; but the spark, that creative, duende-like dark, inarticulable spark (let's not forget "kadosh" is supposedly a tragedy), that which casts on a two-dimensional screen the spell which turns it into an extension of the viewers world, is missing without a trace. perhaps a work of a visual-engineer, perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue; definitely not of a true filmmaker. what i saw was a passion-play for animated issues rather than flesh-blood-and-complexities real people. the acting, by and large, failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced (at times even tortured) into film. one notable, though relatively minor, exception was that of the mikve-lady and the mother, both played by the excellent and seasoned lea koenig.it takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula (namely, a serving of exotica, plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct) to tantalize my interest buds. the bottom line here, all being said, is that for a considerable portion of the movie i was simply bored. in spite of the novel, perhaps even pioneering achievement of using an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a movie set, for which mr. gitai and his crew deserve all praise, i found "kadosh" way too nadosh (hebrew for "trite").

the one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins "what is a jewish porno film?"while this film had its interesting moments, it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox jewish custom, exactly what was going on and why? how many people who came across this film would know that the bathtub the female characters were washing in is in reality called a "mikveh" which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual uncleanliness? the same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage vows being performed. these two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience.this film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. the characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments an ultra orthodox jewish male must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day. the attitudes orthodox judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times maddening. this is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context.i recommend this film to people who are familiar with orthodox jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief peek at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like.the story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against "the system" is of moderate interest at best.

i somehow failed for a few years to see this film, although it has been quite successful and generated a lot of discussions in israel. i am sorry that i did not postpone indefinitely seeing it.the theme of 'kadosh' is a very real and painful one for those who know the jewish religious world - the place of women in the orthodox family and society. the basic situation that sits at the premises of the film is possible, the problem is that the way it is brought to screen and the 'solution' that the conflicts described receives in the movie is wrong. gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach of picking characters that are either fanatic, or unable to express their human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic. neither does he a much better service to his women characters, although here at least he shows more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in yael abecassis and meital barda. overall gitai's vision is too one-sided, his cinema means are too basic, he focuses on the technical details of the jewish religious life, which may be interesting for people who do not know them but are really not relevant at all in the context of the whole story. starting from interesting premises what we get here is a boring film which seems longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical but also from an emotional perspective and a very inconclusive if not even confusing ending. what difference between this film and 'ha ushpizin' inspired from and describing the very same social landscape and which succeeded to transmit human feelings on the screen. in 'kadosh' there are both too little cinema and too little human emotions.

a good friend of mine one said: "a monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere." there is one exception to this: going bananas. it is quite simply the worst movie i have ever seen. it's worse than plan 9, worse than the beast of yucca flats. it is terrible. the talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes, and believe me that's all there is. make sure you have a bunch of people around to revive you after you go into toxic shock from going bananas, the worst movie ever.

i was watching tv one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of "going bananas." believe me when i say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film. the first scene that i saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat guy, and the black guy who looked like dave chappelle, flying around in a crop duster thousands of feet in the air. while everyone else was solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the english word faster. they then landed on a twenty yard long dock in africa. after a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried (hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. they were tearing complete ass in their vintage cadillac when the evil monkey took an air jordan leap form the dock onto the boat that was sailing away a clean 40 yards away and made them sink their beautiful car into the pacific ocean. after seeing this film, i have a new purpose in life; to find the midget who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen.

i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom. i watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job. the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom. i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots (one who got laid and the other who didn't) getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students. the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass. the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot, and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non-existent plot forward. i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had . . . did they look like that? or did you go to the high school that had middle-aged people teaching in it? that is the high school that everyone else went to. the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools. in public schools, principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers, the school board does, but in every episode that i watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers. think back to your history class . . . . . or think of any history class, did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class? no. did you ever see a teacher's lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in? no.teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality. what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students, and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out. the overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines, and i'm sorry, i just didn't buy it. the show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and it should have centered more around the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other.it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot).in the end, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession. i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen.

i saw the movie after checking its rating on imdb. back then, it was at 8.0 and i thought, "wow! that must be a good one". i thought wrong. the beginning of the movie actually keeps what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially down underneath its basement. i think without the character of richie nix, it might have been alright - although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does. the character is just too extreme for my liking, and hard to endure. also, the journey the main character takes from the beginning of the story till its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted - the alternative is, i just did not understand the movie.although i must admit that it is "easy watching", and i had no problems sitting through the whole movie, when it had finished i was somewhat unimpressed by the ending. all in all, rather mediocre.

so, as far as i gather, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is just as scary as the paranormal. the "paranormal" imagery associated with the villain, donnie, is purely symbolic. he's actually just a normal human being.the problem is that i just don't buy it. donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal. he's not even that scary at all. as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has only newly become a murderer, he's significantly less disturbing than most well-known real-life serial killers (eg: he's like a very watered-down version of ed gein). which is why scully's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off (something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all, is completely out of character. she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches.so, as comic book guy says... "worst episode ever!"

here's what's good about "the slaughter rule:"--ryan gosling, clea duvall, and david morse all give great performances. gosling is, as always, pretty darn outstanding. the locales are often breathtaking.here's what's bad about "the slaughter rule:"--everything else. the script is horribly muddled. and while i can certainly appreciate a non-"feel good" movie, this movie is just boring. great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense. just getting through the first hour became a chore.i stuck with it because of gosling, but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel. spoilers on here relayed the ending to me. i didn't miss much. do yourself a favor--if you want a good gosling flick, check out "the believer."my score: 2 out of 10.

ok, so i saw this movie at this year's sundance, and i was sorely unimpressed. it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close-up of ryan gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. after the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watch-able albeit not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. the highlights certainly include both gosling and morse's acting, gosling being an up-and-coming star, and morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. as a sidenote, after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me--he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject.

big disappointment. clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesn't resonate as true coming from these characters. this is melodrama at its peak. the acting is truly over the top and very unreal. only marilyn monroe and keith andes as supporting players give this film any zip. wish they had more to do. i'm somebody who looks at details in films. two big questions...1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working, then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father? 2. when stanwyck is packing to leave town, why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasn't lived for at least two years? also, when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre, who's taking care of the baby again? such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings. what were the writers, directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking? nuf' said.

i've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a very sloppy late-rko assembly-line product. all that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. the editing is downright careless: scenes just end, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. the dialog bears the stilted traces of the odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. but what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. i love stanwyck, but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy, as is ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. the less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: keith andes, whose character is kind of a neanderthal by today's standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as stanwyck's (much younger, one presumes) brother, and marilyn monroe, as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. on monterey's windswept coast (and all that monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. a final point, and a spoiler: perhaps the breen office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey, but i give the marriage a month.

so many people have taken shots at platoon and born on the fourth of july among other calling them "leftist propaganda film." now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. to me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.the acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking. mel gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner randall wallace for yet another one. throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical "just tell my family i love them" or "tell ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed" lines. the was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that i felt like i had to vomit. how about that scene were gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this "no colors" applies to what to put in the washing machine. its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. another scene is were gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.the directing displayed this all perfectly. the countless scenes of gibson and his family or soldiers praying. i'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while i wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. how many scenes with the american flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. the director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in vietnam. what exactly was won their. the cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the american flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. i love america but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.this may seem like a rant and maybe it is but i cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. this movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. to me it says if your not christian your wrong. would god or jesus want people to kill i don't think so. to me this movie was offensive. at first this movie was funny with the countless clichés and overacted scenes but then when i looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. i guess though it is my fault that i chose to watch this movie. i hope no one takes this comment offensively because i am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.if you want a real depiction of the vietnam war watch platoon, born on the fourth of july, apocalypse now, the deer hunter or the killing fields. even full metal jacket which i absolutely hated was a better depiction. i have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. a real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.

does anyone remember braveheart ? it starred mel gibson who also directed and was scripted by randall wallace . the film contains over 200 errors . does anyone remember the green berets ? that`s the john wayne western where the duke saves a homestead called vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . if you watch we were soldiers you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .first of all what`s with that scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? i mean what`s the connection between scotland and `nam ? maybe wallace is using it in the vain hope that because braveheart was bombarded - undeservedly i might add - with several oscars then so might this film ? whatever reason it`s included it really jars . gibson plays hal moore as a cross between william wallace and john wayne and i was expecting him to say something like " they`ll never take our freedom - the hell they will " and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with the green berets like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the wayne moviewhen not reminding the audience of other movies wws also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in america not asia . hal moore might have brushed up on the french experience in indo-china but if that`s the case then he was unique because the american military went out of their way not to read up on the french indo-china war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict westmoreland replied he had nothing to learn from the french " who haven`t won a war since the days of napoleon " so i was confused as to the portrayal of the nva in this movie , when in 1965 the american high command , brimming with hubris held the north vietnamese and vc in contempt . it`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of vietnam are superlative warriors . they are , but very few americans believed this in the mid 1960sthere`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? no bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the la drang valley . likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the americans out number the nva ? i put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . take the scene where the american burned to a crisp is flown away screaming " tell my wife i love her " . this should have an emotional impact similar to that death scene in platoon but here there`s no impact . in fact i found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words " tell my wife ... " while mutilated or dying , i counted at least two other characters use the phrase . did characters actually say this at the battle ? i`ve no idea but since randall wallace wrote the script i do have reservationsi sat in shocked awe watching apocalypse now , platoon and the killing fields made my eyes water , i laughed at full metal jacket , i kept looking at my watch with the deer hunter , and after seeing we were soldiers i felt totally patronised

coltrane and idle are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery. they hide out in a nunnery school and disguise themselves appropriately to avoid detection from the mob and the police. alot of catholic humor and slapstick but the script is kinda thin as are the laughs.. there is a good shower scene though... on a scale of one to ten..4

this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy "a fish called wanda", although i can't see why. the only connection i can find is the monty python one (eric idle in "nuns", john cleese and michael palin in "wanda"). otherwise the two are incomparable.idle and robbie coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead, so they decide to rip off their boss and make for rio. when the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns.what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable, average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour. once again there are the occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings. an attempt at a "wanda" type manic finish fails too, along with the effort at "men in drag" humour, which is hardly surprising. when you think about it, men trying to be women is funny, men trying to be nuns is ridiculous.friday, april 22, 1994 - video

eric idle, robbie coltraine, janet suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. of course it has some funny moments - the scene in the showers when robbie coltraine echoes lon chaney jr's ghastly werewolf line "i can't help myself" is hilarious. but ultimately the plot, script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 "hail mary"s. when i was a child, carry on films filled this niche slightly better, which is a really sad indictment of a film with such a promising cast.

first of all let us discuss about the story. it is a copy of the movie "hitch" with an added indian flavor to it. one guy, who is a love guru, and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. salman khan is the love guru, and govinda is the lame guy.now coming to artists' performance, salman khan overacts throughout the movie, he tries to be funny, but fails big time. you can see salman shouting throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. govinda pairs opposite katrina kaif(oh, my god, she is one heck of a girl. a real beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude, and katrina is a girl in her early twenties. in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of katrina kaif. what a pity! coming to execution of the movie. this movie feels like a b-movie, and a poor imitation of the movie hitch. where hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is shallow and purposeless, nowhere there is justification or clarity.just forget this movie, for it is nothing but boring, typical bollywood fare. actually i give 3/10 because this is the lowest i go.

this movie is widely admonished as being a copy of the will smith feature hitch. that movie was dull.this movie isn't so much dull as unbearable. govinda looks way past his prime. he is not at his best doing roles like this. it is similarly unconvincing as his performance in deewana mastana.salman khan is at his eye-aching "best". and that's in the few scenes where he remembers to put clothes on. it could only have been through nepotism that this eye-sore's scenes could be saved from the trash bin of any movie's cutting floor.another case of bollywood embarrassing itself with it's shameless cloning. another case of the bollywood audience majority embarrassing themselves by making this a hit.

this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. i wouldn't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories, which are not all that funny. there're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. he's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.i think this movie is just an extended version of "hitch", padded with a lot more characters and dancing.if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made, then i'm pretty sure i'm not interested in any of his previous ones.

the movie is not bad in itself...till you see the original movie hitch(2005) starring will smith. the movie is a straight copy with even the dialogs for most part of the movie simply translated from english to hindi! the plot in the original is tightly executed. the hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested. the over-the-top kind of comedy of david dhawan seems to have gone overboard with govinda hysterically shouting at all times...sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for that than the plot. :)if you know english, which i assume you know given that you are reading this, see the hollywood original. at least watch "hitch" if you have watched partner to be able to compare. this is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, i am sad to say, is shamelessly lifted by "inspired" people like david dhawan.

the supposed writer and director mr.dhawan has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster hollywood movie "hitch" starring will smith. many scenes are also exactly the same. the plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humor(probably mr.dhawan's own creation) and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standards.although salman khan and govinda's acting did give us some smiles, however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism, specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs!

i do not remember, at least in the last ten years or so, a movie that i have liked less than mama mia. from the non-existent acting to the atrocious singing, i was cringing at least once per minute. i don't believe i could even recall one brief segment that i tolerated. i do know that i will never watch this disaster again. i cannot believe that with such high expectations due to the talent - colin firth, meryl streep, pierce brosnan, that a movie could be such a flop. but to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drug-induced dancing, and then, horrors of horrors, to hear the singing of pierce brosnan(!), i cannot see how this movie will not make it into the hall of shame. definitely, a movie that never should have been made, and just in case you missed it the first time, one that i will never watch again.

i cannot remember a more trivial, mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake. it seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. no real substance to it all happy and shallow. yeah that'll please the masses. well not this member of the masses. what a trivial load of drivel. i wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. and to think i paid £7 to see this ! i think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. so i like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?

having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas, i had to watch it. i did not expect much, which usually means i get more than i bargained for. but 'mamma mia' - utter, utter cr**. i like abba, i like the songs, i have the old lps. but this film is just terrible. the stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard's musicals in the sixties!meryl (see me i'm acting)streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! her grand piece - 'the winner takes it all' - is meryl at the met! note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan! some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv. one can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. but what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot? blair, campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies - critical faculties anyone???

this movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an abba soundtrack - yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing. the musical presentations in the movie, southpark, was much better than in mama mia. the director of mama mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are abba songs.just to give a sample of the awfulness: an aging meryl streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. why do that to one of the most talented actresses out there?

after sitting through this film, i have decided that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i knew it the moment i was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (omg!) meet again, and then watching the same thing, only done by women old enough to be my mom. and that was only the first few minutes. yeesh. so here are my comments...1. middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.2. pierce brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement, for that matter.3. the songs were so random. it was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy nilly, into the incredibly contrived and stupid plot.4. my three year old nephew could have written a better script.i was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. and i normally really like movie musicals. of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. what a waste of talent. i mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie...i am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career. i regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap.

i love musicals, all of them, from joyous oklahoma, to poignant porgy and bess, to the touching romantic "damn yankees." and i know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.in a "real" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. it is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. so, in guys and dolls, "my time of day" describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.for this lover of the broadway musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. there, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. while here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals. they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in "sweet charity."let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. perhaps, another day, another mood, i could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.but i can't help but imagining what richard roger, oscar hammerstein, cole porter, irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. i think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and i can not help but to mourn the great loss.

i don't know where most of you were at, but where i watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of brosnan. the only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. i was a dj in the seventies and even went to the abba concert at northlands coliseum in edmonton in sept of 79, so i did appreciate them then and i still do now. but this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. the sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be meryl's worst production. i cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. so save your money, wait for it to come out on dvd and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.

everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut to the chase.forced frivolity. miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun. the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try. pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing. inexplicably set on a greek island. lots of squealing, shrieking women. lots.it was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. if you like abba, so-so. if not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. i readily admit that i didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of god. why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight? ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town? that's the feeling of this whole project. it just felt so good when it stopped.

there's no better way to describe the horrendous experience that's to watch mamma mia: hitler must be looking up, saying to the pseudo-director phyllida lloyd 'you monster, what have you done?'everything about the movie is wrong. just wrong! even its success, which is unexplainable. i can understand when those crappy parody movies, like epic movie, make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap (of course they are!). but when something like mamma mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide, you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world?'and to think we have meryl streep, one of the greatest alive actresses of the world, in it? what was she thinking? 'i need the money', she could say. well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. it's not that meryl is good in a disastrous piece of, err, 'movie'. she's also disastrous! when she sings, even though she's got the vocals, it's ridiculous. worse than her only pierce brosnan. he used to be james bond. now he's singing abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. really? and when i mention abba, not that i have anything against the band and their music. though it doesn't help them when actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (they pop out of nowhere! frequently!) to present one terrible musical sequences after the other. you wanna cry when the music starts. and i love musicals! but this is the first in the genre where you pray for actual silence.i could keep going. the list goes on forever. you could write a stephen king novel with the complete list of mistakes in this movie.to sum up: go watch it! really! you've got to witness to understand!! and since it's already a huge success, who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you? and it's not liking you're selling your soul to the devil. meryl did that before. for the whole mankind. and now the world must end, because we've committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.

relentless like one of those loud action movies. the entire cast seems to be on speed. i didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. i wonder if she's ever seen a stanley donen, vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical. structure, please! this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba. the costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself. no chemistry with her friends (christine baranski and julie walters) think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you'll understand what i was hoping for. i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth. the audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.

this is a new approach to comedy. it isn't funny.the joke is that this, in and of itself, is supposed to be funny.the story is based on a french short story, located in paris, and the characters have french names. louis aubinard, for example ... played by ... bob hoskins? the movie also stars the equally french jeff goldblum and natasha richardson. the situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those carry-on movies from years back.i believe these are also jokes - to cast these actors who make no attempt to act french in any way, to have them cavort in the manner of broad english dance hall comedy, and to leave the whole bloomin' mystery unexplained to the audience.in the humour department, this is practically the algonquin round table, isn't it?the movie tries to be charming and quirky, and i guess these characteristics are sort of funny. not as funny as duck soup or love and death, perhaps, but funnier than the deer hunter or the battleship potemkin.it is an example of personal filmmaking. it makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but stays true to its premise and its internal logic. although all the situations are unbelievable, they are logical within the film's own bizarro world.i generally like this kind of eccentric movie, but i found this one to be paced too slowly, to be dull-witted, tedious, and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit. it just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways, and wastes some wonderful talents along the way. it has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars, who are all otherwise distinguished players. i found it to be the biggest waste of talent since the betsy, and i wish i had never seen goldblum and hoskins in this thing.so, call it an interesting miss, and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill.

this movie is not that good at all.its pretty stupid, pretty annoying, and very poorly done.i really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.although i didn't hate it as much as them, i still found it to be a pretty bad film.the only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times, and also i feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.what i mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast, not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.instead it isn't but instead what it is now, a crappy film.the acting is atrocious i felt as if i was watching a couple of teens act for like a halloween show or thrill ride or something.the kills are pretty cheap(as is the film itself), and basically everything else is low-class.overall this film really is bad and you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film.3.8 out of 10 stars

i have to say that there is one redeeming speck in regards to this "film". it firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel. now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie. other than that i regret watching this debacle. what shameless abandon the making of this "film" was. what a waste of $100,000 (that's right folks, one hundred thousand dollars). this "film" reminds me of that "adult video awards" show in which of group of "industrial prostitutes" stand up a praise themselves, believing that they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. ironic then how i've watched blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. i also found it funny that the executive producer, justin ament, just had to be in the "movie". he plays deputy jake barker. i'm sure his "acting" career has taken off... ted pfiffer, the writer, has a part. he no doubt was wallowing in the clichéd glory he created. it should be noted that carrie finklea has a lead role in the movie. you might remember her from gus van sant's 'elephant'. though i'm not too sure that she'll want to write this film on her resume. and i'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it. along with 'torque', 'godsend' and 'sky captain and the world of tomorrow', one of the worst films, if not the worst film, of 2004.

whoa!terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did i mention terrible?you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me.well, someone brought this home for me to watch, and when i looked at it i just wanted to strangle the person, because they used my money.i will certainly be taking it back soon, but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory, for i definitely want to forget it.this movie doesn't deserve to even be called horrible.it's beyond horrible.quite possibly, the worst film ever.the acting was so, so, so, so horrifically disgusting, as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable.i didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, which kind of frightens me a little.don't see this film, shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page, and i have extreme pity for you if you're looking at this movie page, because you think this will be decent.final word: yuck!!!!!!!!!!

i usually like hongkong - martial arts - fantasy movies but i hated this one. once upon a time in china, shogun assassin, a chinese ghost story and even big trouble in little china are my favorites but this film sucked! too much fancy tricks and stupid story.4/10

i love most jet li movies (with the exception of romeo must die) and i bought this movie in a very cheap three-pack with "the master" and "twin warriors". while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it, and the master was a bit "karate kid" but also enjoyable, i thought this movie was terrible. i'm not just saying that because i'm used to better movies. i'm saying that it was almost down there with "kazaam". the fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". if you are going to have a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with jet li') you best have some great fighting to go with it. if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie, i suggest you go rent "shaolin temple 2" (aka kids from shaolin).

like in so many movies of the past, you would think hollywood would learn this by now, makes for a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom.maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us. why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost? just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end.i had to listen to part of the director's comments in the special features section, from the great moves that redford has made in the past, (sneakers for one) surprised he agreed to star in such a film. the director's comments and reasons were weak.the best parts of this movie was the scenery, can't wait for spring to come.

i had never heard of "the clearing" until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention. the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest, but once we popped it into the dvd player, the boredom was only beginning.the story was dragged out for waaaay too long. it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping. the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie, however. after that, the outline was followed exactly and that made "the clearing" unoriginal. the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victim's family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film. and i also found that i did not like the ending, so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all.the acting was not horrible...it wasn't the greatest, though. robert redford has given much better performances. willem dafoe's tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. helen mirren's portrayal as robert redford's wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heart-splitting event.in my opinion, "the clearing" is nothing to rave about. use your movie rental money on something else...like "garden state," perhaps?

i'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio get's away with this. the movie is just not worth it. maybe as a theater-play but certainly not as a movie! and why do they call it a thriller??? offcource the acting is good but i did'n't expect anything less from these perfect actors. robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the softy "bad guy". helen mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me ;). i'm also a fan of her british detectives. still they just can't save this ow so boring movie, i'm sorry. i hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director "pieter jan brugge" cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words "suspence and thriller".

what an atomic bomb of a movie. the story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere. it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying "is this it". what happened to redford. he was once a fair actor. now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take. wrong. what an unemotional film. i don't mean to be so so cruel, but what crap of a movie. unbelievable amateur crap. if i was in this movie i would be so embarased that i would not show my face. i tell you what, if i was associated with this movie, i am in big trouble. this movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to.

business executive is kidnapped, made to wander miles and miles in a woodland for days and days exchanging dialog with his kidnapper.and we have got to listen to all the nonsense......meanwhile his snotty wife and family are at home with the fbi wondering what to do...... .....at no time does she seem concerned about the fate of her husband except when it comes to the ransom..... a "love story"? give me a break!the plot is ludicrous. and almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant is going to happen but it never does.the result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more silly when we learn the fate of the kidnapper.this is garbage:2 out of 10.

i saw this video at a friends house, and it was the lamest thing i have seen ever. i lost a lot of the little respect i had for nin. very boring, and the music is as equally interesting. dont waste your time unless you are a hardcore nin "fan"

i saw this in the cinema during its initial release and can only ask "has the world gone mad?" the seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind boggling for this poorly written, embarrasingly predictable clap trap.stephan elliot is no genius film maker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since (check out 'welcome to woop woop', 'eye of the beholder')i can only assume making a film dealing with the gay/transexual culture has people assuming that to dislike the film is an offense to this sector of the populace. aren't we smarter than that? what about an interesting script and good performances? ok so the 3 leads do alright considering what they have to work with, but this film includes the worst performance by a child actor i have ever seen, not helped by appalling dialogue and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile off.this is a disappointing film and one that doesn't deserve the overblown reputation it has garnered.

basically a road movie. the gay, transsexual, and other gender-bender themes are rather disturbing, particularly when the child is involved. you do have to hand it to the costume designers. as for the actors, the only one i was familiar with was terence stamp. i suppose it was a very good performance, out of his (or anyone's) normal range. the movie as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for the clever, bitchy banter. all in all, i don' recommend this one.

alien express is one of the worst movies i've bothered to experience.the plot is predictable. the aliens look like rubber sock puppets. the effects would have been mediocre in the 70's, but are just atrocious by today's standards. couldn't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model?the acting isn't great but, really, the dialogue is the worst part. it gouges its way into your mind. "don't you die on me. not now." if you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie, you'll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens, the model train, or the clichéd dialogue.the only reason i didn't give this movie a "1" is that it doesn't deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film.

after watching this movie on tv, i looked it up in the imdb and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7.6! this is not a good film. especially bad is the editing; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction. it's not very fluently done. i do agree that the acting was fairly decent, especially kelly kapowski, and that the story was intriguing enough.

"war is in your blood" rambo says early in the film, "don't fight it". say, what? is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly? it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here. yet, stallone utters it without a hint of irony.the same lack of humour applies to the movie. rambo iv is an over-the-top, idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren't sickeningly violent. a redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous, it is not enough just to kill them  you have to dismember them with relish. stallone stops at no blue-collar cliché to make his point. it is not enough for the chief villain to be feed-them-to-the-pigs, throw-babies-into-fire kind of sadist. he is also a pedophile homosexual.what is happening to imdb? is it taken over by the rifle society? how can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high? i like a good action movie as much as the next man, but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of myanmar. the only good thing about the movie is that sly doesn't take his shirt off. for this i will give it one star...

now the television schedules (in england, at least) are crammed with home improvement, bargain-hunting, house-hunting and cookery shows in the afternoons, the chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slender, to say the least. but back in the eighties, the bbc did just that, and guess what, i watched it. and it's a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarian-american co-production that i can still remember large chunks of it, over twenty years later. to begin with, the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles, only to vanish again for at least half an hour. (imagine an american tail re-edited so feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you'll appreciate how confusing this is.) there's a supremely bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborately waxed moustache tweaked and stretched, complete with a boingy sound effect that causes him to go boss-eyed. probably hilarious if you're stoned, but to a child, quite disturbing. speaking of which, the infamous 'hippo cull' scene is represented in an abstract manner - clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning - but it's still pretty unpleasant. in fact, this film is pretty cold and uninvolving throughout, a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strange-looking production design, all muddy colours, wobbly lines, bloated forms and that uniquely european bleakness reminiscent of jan svankmajer, only not as compelling. then, to cap it all, we get songs by the osmonds! this isn't so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one, not so much phantasmagorical as a rather bad trip.

licence fees to watch this trash, and pay for it with hard-earned cash? humourless, no hint of laughter, god knows how it won a bafta! we've now been subjected to "eastenders" for twenty years. when, oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is? crass pap! this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut, and never has done.the eastenders i know (the real ones) are kind, courageous, hardworking and loyal. and one of their greatest attributes is humour. it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler. and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including an omnibus)? nothing but a bunch of moaning, wailing, "dead from the neck up" wimps, who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other. what a great advert for britain that is!! do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out? obviously the woolly-minded section of the public does, but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything.

the other lowest-rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add. i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children, who insist on watching the sunday omnibus. my god, it's depressing! like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other, but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be. the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot-on. if anyone lived in a social environment like this, they'd slash their wrists within days. and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more 'ethnically enriched' than you'll ever see here. take my advice - avoid this nadir of the british tv industry. it is evil.

some plot spoilers ahead.the nashville network's so-called rebirth as "the first network for men" is a complete disappointment, as was its block of adult cartoons. the new ren and stimpy was just plain awful, "gary the rat" mediocre at best, and "stripperella" pretty unwatchable. this cartoon is mostly boring; if "ren and stimpy" suffered from gross-out overkill, "stripperella" lacked any decent shock gags, funny witless gags, clever gags, or gags, period. the concept is bad to begin with: pamela anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, saves "the city" from an assortment of goofy supervillains. this cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs, like "darkwing duck" and "the tick," but without those cartoons' wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding. "agent 0069" tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy, but she is neither, and this cartoon's failure to make her one or the other brings this series down.watch your taped episodes of "the tick," and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like.

the first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting. the whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that i started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film. an even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character. the one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is halfdan hussey's innovative visual effects. however, as eye-catching as they may be, they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above. a dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing. i was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was.

i thought of this movie when i watched pluto nash...why..because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot, this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that...whoa...avoid at all costs even to pay tribute to the late great andy kaufman is hard to do here...find another film or just watch taxi reruns on latenight tv...his latka gravas character is so much more loveable...tank you berry much

my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out.there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time.this is the only movie i have ever walked out on.it was just painful to sit through.the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund.never had that happen before or since pleae do not rent this you will really regret it i am really sureprised by the vote summary perhaps personal tast has something to do with it

"i presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry." - valmike nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book, "movie megacheese." i asked myself, "why would mike nelson steer me wrong?" i now know why the bots never trusted mike nelson.the music is by john williams, which is probably part of his payment to the devil. in fact, i'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol' slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the executive director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. don't watch...for the love of god...don't watch!!! not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...i'm doomed now, i understand this. i accept this. but save yourself...

if you like bad movies, this one's a real treat. kaufman & peters stagger around in robot costumes, escape slavery only to wander aimlessly, and find true robot love. i believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out. i should note i was 12, and could be entertained by shiny objects.

i really wanted to like this movie, but the pacing was just way too slow.it was a nice story, but it was really like watching a slug race.the movie would have been better served, if it had some more action. i don't mean anything grand, but at least something in the background.it could have also been helped by songs that set the tone/mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue.it's been about 10 years since i've seen it, so i may have to give it another chance.3/10 or *1/2(out of four)

little did i know that when i signed up the the "all pay channel" package with direct tv that i would face a movie like this. it came on right after another movie we had been watching... and i was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where i was at the time... but i missed this movie.i also can't believe we left it on. it is kind-of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s... but i think even then this would have been a painful movie. it was just... well... "too cute"! et was "cute" in a way... but not obnoxiously cute... and stupid.when i see a movie like this... i come on onto imdb to see what others say. i am blown away that this thing was nominated! wow... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s! oh well... it did show some old actors... btw that is the other thing i was surprised about... the lineup... not a bunch of no-names... but some real actors/actresses. must have been in their drug days! anyways... odd, interesting, bizarre, and makes one happy they grew up!

to sum this movie up, it is labute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce. the predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters. there is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the pc. basically the movie just doesn't work, its plot is beyond contrived, the characters are one-dimensional cliches, there is no consistency or development of anything, and the comedy (where it is not totally out of place) is the worst kind of high concept drivel.morgan freeman and renee zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio-driven audience pandering--no matter what, make them likeable, neutral (and neutered), and full of moral platitudes. crispin glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore. chris rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman freeman--it's as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other. in effect, chris rock seems like a digital insert. at least he isn't as annoying as jar-jar.labute's 15 minutes may well be up by now. it's already looking like he's overstayed his welcome.

renee zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this movie just does not work. it's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on film? i like director labute's two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny. this film manages only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes. (as high concept, think: the doris day-rock hudson movie sam peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present, mass-produced state of hollywood.) that actors as talented as freeman, kinnear, eckhart, vince, and janney almost make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere. i would have found freeman's corny, feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a lynchean way) if it weren't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously.

okay, this movie starts out and it *looks* like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. she has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap (sort of the inverse of the main characters in "pleasantville") and runs away to los angeles to meet a fictional character. well it is a cute movie... but at the same time, it is also a dark, very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill betty for reasons way to complex to recount here. either plotline would have been enough on it's own, but "nurse betty" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very jarring. i didn't much enjoy it.

i was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. commercials for it made it look quirky and i generally like morgan freeman and chris rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. sadly, i was terribly disappointed with nurse betty.personally, i've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together, and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are tarantino and the coens. there isn't that much violence in nurse betty, but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when i was supposed to laugh. of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where i was being asked to.the film doesn't much work as a drama, either. renee zellweger's betty, the story's protagonist, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. i will say zellweger acts the role quite well, and freeman, rock, and greg kinnear all do good jobs too. the problem is in the writing; freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. it's really too bad. 3/10

a wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller. to me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one, and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. for example, rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy. the scene where betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy. an even better example is the hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through freeman's character, early on, about the plight of the indians; i mean - yawn! they should have given freeman something funny to say in that segment, but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring pc speech.there is yet more new age pc-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesn't get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact, the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! bit of a feminist statement there. the first half-hour is weak, but the movie gets better - ironically - once zellweger gets to kinnear. i say "ironically" because i'm not much of a fan of kinnear's, though he's solid here. zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the sort of all-american cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy, and i have to wonder why more of such women aren't "represented" nowadays, instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars, such as diaz, roberts, aniston, lopez, or barrymore.since the movie tries to be very serious at times, i have no choice but to criticize freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold. there is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son.

by the standards of hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within hollywood. thats where anything remotely close to having hollywood standards ends. this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i am not joking. the story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that i could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film. i know what you're saying, "its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it's supposed to scare you." well let me tell you something, the movie is not even scary in the least bit. its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been. the acting was awful as well, along with the scariness of the murderer, who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off. throughout the movie i kept getting a sense i was watching something that was thought up, written, produced, and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography. please, don't see this movie, spend your $8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more worth your while.

... once. "manos, the hands of fate." that was worse than this, quite a bit worse: but it did have one thing: it had beautiful women in negligees wresting each other -- for about 20 minutes. this has a fat 45 year-old with 3 tits and a tail, in a cantina scene cloned directly from "star wars." not to mention an obese, blue seductress uhura, her fat legs and ass hanging out of some sort of insane bird costume, in this method acting mess. she always wanted to perform before a "captive audience"? she must have meant the poor slobs who shelled out 8 bucks hoping to see another "wrath of khan," or at least a "voyage home." captive" is right. i wonder how many people in the theaters tried to slit their wrists while crying out: "mother, make it stop."no question about it, "final frontier" is not just an unmitigated disaster, it's cruel and unusual punishment. this is star trek from hell. this is shatner on mushrooms -- or maybe peyote. this is where no man has gone before and wished he never had in the first place. or, to paraphrase a review of "heaven's gate: "it's as if gene roddenberry sold his soul to the devil for the success of a tv series, and devil is just now coming around to collect."and don't even get me started on a drunken kirk and a grinning mccoy singing "row, row, row your boat" together, like they were lovers in some sort of demented gay fever dream. then we've got the hideous dynamic duo of sulu and chekov, hiking through the woods together... probably en route to a barry manilow concert. then there's laurence luckinbill as spock's brother???!!! yeah, right! amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line. and not to forget spock rocketing through the air after kirk when he falls from a cliff in yosemite. sure. he catches up to kirk and saves him one foot away from the ground. where'd you get those nifty rocket shoes, spock?!

i guess that after leonard nimoy had been successful in directing "the search for spock" and "the voyage home," william shatner thought he could direct too. although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he's just not a good director.actually, this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of trekkies who say that william shatner being an arrogant egomaniac. for although his character, captain james kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original "star trek," it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, captain spock and doctor leonard mccoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.the plot is that some emotional vulcan outcast named sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a human, klingon, and romulan diplomat is taking place. this lures the still-being-constructed enterprise there, since none of starfleet's other ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with how starfleet is run, the klingons and romulans should have conquered them years ago). sybok adds the enterprise's crew, save spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with sybok), mccoy, and kirk. sybok orders that the enterprise take off to "the center of the universe" to meet "god," who apparently every race has a word for. however, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the enterprise and kirk asks, "what does god need with a starship." the entity is destroyed, but not before sybok, realizing he's been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns spock's respect in death after the enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably sybok as well.ok, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. why do people follow sybok just for releasing their pain? why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? i've certainly led a trauma-free life. why doesn't kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join sybok? what was the point of sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?so the plot's weak. another problem is that sybok, though played well by lawrence luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. just because he's an emotional vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic. shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional vulcan. i guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. gee, i guess that means that klingons should say "isn't" and "don't" more often than "is not" and "do not." and the cardassians shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, i know it's sad that i know this). please... every st race uses unique dialog. why is sybok the exception.the only thing to not complain about is the acting. i've always known "star trek" to have great actors, and this movie is not exception. cudos also go to leonard nimoy, for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate spock in his old age.some other things i didn't like:shatner and the late deforrest kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing "row, row, row your boat" in this movie. i guess shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability. what he did was prove their point.uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap. after all, the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle-aged plump women dancing naked.comedy's all well and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of "star trek" too much, but when scotty bumps into an object on the enterprise and kos himself, it's kinda goin' overboard.kirk is the only crew member who can reject sybok's offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the god imposter's deception. not even spock can manage either of these? perhaps this scenes were valantines from shatner to his character, as many suspect.the concept of an entity posing as god had been used in "star trek" before this movie more than once. be creative, shatner.speaking of uncreativeness, i didn't purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of "star trek: the next generation."all in all, pretty bad "trek" movie. if you're a trekkie, watch it once because it's "star trek." otherwise, watch "star trek ii: the wrath of khan." it's way better.

this was so bad i can't even review it. so i'll jot some sentences about what i witnessed, and it'll be up to you to decide. captain kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is rock climbing yosemete's el capitan. spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. kirk falls. spock flies down, catches him inches before kirk hits the ground head- first. later, that night, spock, kirk and mccoy are eating beans around a campfire. spock likes the beans. then, kirk and mccoy sing "row row row your boat", and want spock to join in on the three-way harmony. spock doesn't want to sing. and later that night, he disagrees. "but life isn't but a dream, captain". should i go on? okay... a renegade vulcan, who happens to be spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. the crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. but they can't trick the brother, who claims he can find god. he kidnaps the crew and the enterprise. they go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be god, spits fire at kirk, spock, and mccoy. spock's sibling, realizing it isn't god - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and... sparks fly. then, after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving klingons who resemble lorenzo lamas... the three amigos - kirk, spock and mccoy - return to yosemite (did i mention, kirk was wearing a go climb a rock t-shirt?). with spock playing some kind of funky vulcan guitar, they sing "row row row your boat", this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll.

i find it almost touching how star trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws.to begin with, none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak. scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. uhura...gods, i can't even think about what they did to her character. all of her dialog was painful to listen to. mccoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to kirk instead of his trusted friend. spock...well, let's just say that leonard nimoy was terribly wasted. he was given bad dialog ("i do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation captain." gravity, get it? get it?) and made almost into a buffoon. kirk...oh man, don't get me started. william shatner is a hammy actor to begin with, so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got.the plot is beyond ridiculous. giving spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish. but hey, let's go with it. the search for god. again, a weak plot basis. you don't think so? ok, let's go with that too. so assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound, what's wrong with the script? well, for one thing, it recycles way too much. the enterprise, for example, is yet again, not working properly. are we to assume that starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want james kirk to handle the situation? if that's the case, then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser? adding to that...the crew is grossly incompetent. scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness while there are hostiles on board!), no one seem to notice the klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range) and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other. in other words, there is no sense of discipline. if this is the flagship of starfleet, then it's a wonder that the klingons hadn't already overthrown the federation.as to the personal struggles with pain, it was crap. lawrence luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he couldn't save this turkey. in short no one could. of all the people involved, i imagine leonard nimoy is the most embarrassed by it. i hope he is, anyway.thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this cloddish opus.

what is it with studios like paramount that have a proven hit film series on their hands, and figure it can screw around with the budget and formula? paramount spent less on this film than they did on tmp, which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there's a 10 gap between when the films were made. the $40 tmp cost to make would be equivalent to about $75 million in 1989. this film is the reason that shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films, as well. every time he turned around, the studio was slashing the budget and making demands regarding the storyline. the fact that this was the one storyline that roddenberry and shatner could agree upon for the most part made the freshman directorial task tough enough, but after all the machinations were done, all anyone ended up with was an uneven story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series, much less a major motion picture. the most glaring examples: - all of the phaser effects were severely ashed out and fake-looking. - the shot of the enterprise going into the great barrier was so obviously a still-frame shot being zoomed away from. at least the popsicle stick that held the enterprise cut out up was successfully matted out. - god "chasing" kirk up the mountain... egads, they may as well have just cut in shots of godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of "godzilla 1985," and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion off of the film to make electric bolts come out of his eyes at the imperiled captain kirk.... yes, friends, i have a real problem with the look of that last scene, especially.thank goodness star trek vi was such a redeemer of a film...

i like underdogs. so, 12 years after having first seen star trek v, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, i gave it a second watch, hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time around.i didn't.the writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. what was even worse, from the original cast's pov, is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation, and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! what an embarrassment.the final frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - i gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.* unless it's an episode with troi's mother in it.

compared to the recent gore flick hostel, which this movie reminded me a lot of-- i would say that see no evil is slightly better but not by much. the very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence. the kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (i guess). the one thing i dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a wwe wrestler, kane. he ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. there are a couple fairly gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the movie.i can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great. can't recommend it.

the cheesiest movie i've ever seen, not scary, just bad. 1st movie made by the wwe, and trust me,the only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans. it has terrible acting and the worst directing i've seen yet.i found myself laughing at the storyline, and bad actors. i saw that the wwe people tried really hard to put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills, and several camera effects. i think they copied a lot from silent hill. this movie's not engaging either, so if you do see it, you're gonna find yourself tuning out because of it's lack of suspense. the ending's the worst, no matter what, you'll come out wanting your money back

danny is beyond sorry.he keeps making the same mistakes, and is no longer interesting to watch. at first i could feel for him, as an addict myself. my heart went out to him at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going, and at the same time is seriously risking his life, and the welfare of his family, especially his children. it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy. i think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage. i can't understand how gretchen stays with him, and i keep wondering how much is just for show, and how much is love. danny, get a life - a new one that is! ...and don't get me started on dr. gary. what is with him and his face? his skin looks like it's stretched to the max. besides that, looks don't mean a thing, yet he seems not to be particularly impartial. i think, he too, is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny. these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. c'mon pull yourselves together.

poor diane arbus (whoever she was). not only was she (according to this movie) a spoiled-but-sweet-acting upper east side brat, she was a bad wife, bad mother, awful business partner; plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist -- except in the bold statement in the prologue.nicole kidman, who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger, indeed gives an excellent performance; but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolf-looking guy living in the apartment upstairs? set in the early 1970's, manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and weirdo's of all sizes and shapes, most not looking like human hairballs; so why is this affair worthy of a 122 minute movie?robert downey jr used to be one of my favorites, but i'd say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its toll. one might think he'd be disinclined to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking cigarettes. fur has already taken a beating at the box office, but in view of those who input a score of 10 for this misbegotten slice of trash, i'd like to say, 'taint so, mcgee.

bizarre. this movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. i guess it tries to explain why diane arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus. in the movie, wolfman moves into the apartment above hers. she seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. she puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman, and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings. some of the wolfman's freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them. the whole thing is very bizarre.final verdict: nothing memorable. there is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman. i think you can find better films out there.

i could have liked this if i didn't like diane arbus.didn't really capture arbus unique visual aesthetic(as stanley kubrick did in "the shinning", with the twin girls in the hallway, a direct homage to one of arbus most famous photos, and one with haunting qualities none of this movies images have), and certainly none of her character(outgoing), likeness(thin and jewish, not wasp queen kidman), or life, save some very superficial similarities, she was a fashion who later photographed "freaks" and "outsiders", among many things. this film focused on the "freak", as her symbol for artistic and personal empowerment, in a really shallow and predictable fashion. outside of that, it might have been an interesting movie about middle class fetish, but i was too annoyed to care.perhaps if arbus name had been left off, this might have been less annoying, but had it not had her name in the title there would have been nothing to make me interested in seeing in this in the first place. a letdown from "secretary".

as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960's that followed, diane arbus (nicole kidman) can be excused as an early flower child. the film itself deserves no such latitude. the lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing. i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke. that the few facts presented did not match diane arbus' life very much did not help to clarify things either.the washed out art direction in diane's 'normal' life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her 'awakening' life with lionel. and the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (however, i don't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to lionel's apartment which was two flights of stairs up from her's).maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment. i also would have liked to see at least one of diane's photos as well. i won't wait for the sequel.

i don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments. one can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos. i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie. rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior. it was just another hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and ok. from the very beginning i asked my self what was the point of this movie,and i continued watching, hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein. i am so glad i did not spend the money to see this in a theater!

what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film? arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. what possessed anyone to make this film, which explains her unique artistic vision, as being the result of an (imaginary) affair with a grotesque, yet charismatic hairy freak (played by downey)?in real life, arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman's role to express herself. in this movie, arbus is an ultra-dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a "beauty and the beast" devotion to an interesting man.for this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. independent of that, it is also just dopey and dull.

hadn't really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it. i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly.when the movie opens up, you see nicole kidman going to a nudist camp. whoa. shock. that scene, the dialouge, were all great. and then the movie went downhill.while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie sucked. it was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. robert downey jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit through. it tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors.don't waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.

for anyone who cares to know something about the real diane arbus, or who values psychological veracity, this film is abysmal. arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless, and troubled person, but this film depicts her as completely self-involved, and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. kidman portrays her as wan and vague, whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma. the totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable, and robert downey is truly annoying in his smirking portrayal of someone who seems to think he's superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. the film depicts this encounter as being the source of arbus's interest in "freaks," which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. the mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way.

in order to enjoy 'fur - an imaginary portrait of diane arbus,' stephen shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer, diane arbus. paradoxically, it's the very use of diane arbus' name and knowledge to her life and work, that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale.what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful waspish and glamorous nicole kidman as the anti-glamorous jewish diane arbus, is that shainberg didn't get arbus or what her work was about (unsentimental realism) and seems only attracted to arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks.what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty & the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as kidman's hairy fictional love interest. however, it's not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film, but the director's misogynistic stance that diane arbus, one of the art world's most singular and original woman photographers, was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work. while his previous film 'secretary' was a study of female masochism, his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely - and flys in the face of the real life diane arbus' courage, tenacity and fearlessness in single-handedly exploring the often shady world of outsiders.imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star madonna's life with guy richie as her svengali, the man behind her career, and you'll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is: it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject, or just choose to ignore all the facts.it's a shame because once you remove all reference to diane arbus, this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to secretary. 4/10

this movie was so predictable and poorly acted. i really can't recommend it to anyone, not even for unintentional laughs. it is just plain bad. it is pure tv movie hell, the cast doesn't seem all that bad, but they act terribly. just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual, like porn.

i have to admit, that out of the many many thriller movies i have seen, this has to be one of the worst. i was shocked to discover that this piece of work had a 1.5 mil budget. when it started, i thought that the opening sequence was pretty good, fairly standard for this kind of film, but pretty good anyway. but as the film progressed i began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing, each sequence seemed to take hours. the reason for this could have been that by now the film had already bored me to tears, nothing was happening other than endless accusations peppered with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fit of bad temper. well ... after wading through what felt like a lifetime of these scenes we finally reached the big finale...an all singing, all dancing demonstration of how lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good film.overall i found this movie predictable and tedious and i would not recommend this film to anyone other than those people i personally dislike, but if you have a couple of hours to waste and you want to watch a thriller that is not even remotely scary, this is the movie for you.

this is a below average martial arts films which is worth watching for the comedy value due to the part where a pair of symbols are used as weapons. thats it really there is much to say about this film it lacks in every department because the martial arts are not that great either and with all movies of this type the dubbing as bad

"this film is great! i watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn't have to see commercial success to be a hit!" ...is what i would love to be able to say about this film. in the words of the film itself "you are very very bad!" i went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once so generally agree with the moral of the film though.i'd include a spoiler, but the lack of plot makes this very tricky. overall, a cinematic disaster.quotes; 'you're not a leper at all!' 'you're beautiful, and i bet you're nice too' 'have you ever seen a naked man's body?' 'you couldn't break a piece of straw.'cameos in dubbing; micheal cane x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.

around 1980, the name godfrey ho was attached to a series of low-comedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name elton chong". although no masterworks of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for silliness.it is altogether unclear why ho (or whomever) would want to make a film that would attack jackie chan's drunken master, the film that legitimated the making of comedy-action films in hong kong. but that's what this is, a savage attack on the chan film (the imitation chan who stars in this movie learns to cause his opponents to laugh themselves to death - a pointless gimmick in any genre).along with all the flaws one expects from a godfrey ho film of this period - no continuity, no motivation, incomprehensible plot line, irrelevant and unbelievable characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable faults that effectively make it unwatchable: the fight scenes stink, and the comedy isn't funny.pointless.

i took my family to see barnyard this past weekend. we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there, my husband and i would have left. coming from a farming community we found the fact that all of the male bovine in the film having udders drawn on them was a little disturbing. we felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something. it was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body. after checking some of the production notes on a different website, i felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact. i know this is just an animated, humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male, i had to suspend my disbelief so much that i just couldn't enjoy the movie like i might have. i know udders can be found funny but they were definitely over used. none of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and i would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all. the kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time afterward to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.

...i normally hate puns, but this seems the only appropriate summary for "barnyard". i suspect i am not the first. and i'm sure many, many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders. it certainly bothered me right off the bat. but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work.personally, if i was a parent, i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes. (although for me, it at least injected a little action.) and from a conventional screen writing point of view, you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict(gee- you have a "widow" cow...maybe her "husband" was killed by coyotes? nope...there's a much dumber explanation.) and what kind of a farm is this? otis vows to protect all the animals from harm, but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans. they make reference to the farmer being vegan, but what is he raising pigs for? in all children's animal stories- babe, charlotte's web, you name it...the reality of farm life is at least touched on. perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter (there is some reference to this, but it's never explained.) but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny, but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. and what the heck is the deal with "wild mike"? it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ball-gag.add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes, a nearly complete lack of laughs, and those udders, and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages. i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known- not to slam the current #2 box-office hit. but this movie angered me. it was taking up space in my local theater, space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer- in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex. but i'm not allowed to see something like "little miss sunshine" so viacom can cheat families out of an extra $30. at least i had a free pass.i know that as a 35 year old with no children, this film was not designed for me. but there's just no excuse for such a lazy, dreadful children's film as "barnyard" in the age of pixar. i was bored by the "ice age" films, but they certainly didn't anger me like "barnyard". "shark tale" was a weak attempt at street hipness, but it had quite a few laughs. for that matter, you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day, and see something more entertaining and intelligent- which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage.i'm giving it a 2 out of 10, only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing, and maria bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife. well, not the farmer's wife. some other farmer. they didn't really explain who she was. they didn't explain a lot of things. especially not why sam elliot- the ultimate "man's man"- had an udder jiggling around down there. creepy.

barnyard sucked! i saw this movie last week and it is horrible. what bull has udders? my 2 year old was asking me if all cows have udders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more! in addition, the violent theme scared my 2 year old. they made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. i know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators. the mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting, "kill him, kill him, yea" in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil per sayit is a lion king rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie. steve oederek who has also done thumb movies, such as thumb wars, thumbelina and many others are so so bad!if a good steve oederek movie ever comes out in my lifetime, i will roll over naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on youtube.com ...enough said!

this movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics. my two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters. this was a nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t.v. station. the animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was horrible. a classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies, but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention. this was not the case with this film. there were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without.

when my six-year-old fell asleep at the theater during this movie, that was all the confirmation i needed that this film is a stinker. it was boring. the scary parts were boring. the maudlin parts were boring. even the funny parts -- with two minor exceptions -- were boring. and predictable. and did i mention predictable? examples: 1) the gruff but loving dad indulging his brat of a kid. 2) the gruff but loving dad buying the farm (while singing a song?!). 3) the brat of a kid deciding to cut and run, but, thanks to his friends, sticking things out because they need him. 4) the brat of a kid winning against incredible odds. 5) and a sassy character voiced by an african-american actress. gotta credit these filmmakers for that bit of originality and for perpetuating that stereotype. i did mention two funny bits. in both cases, contributed by minor characters. the mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was funny. the farm dog falling victim to his doggy weaknesses while vying for leadership was funny. but the rest? painful. someone tried to make a hipness-thru-committee movie and make it even hipper by making it a computer-animated film, and this was the result. and why make the coyotes batman-villain dumb by monologuing with their victims, rather than just eating them? oh yeah. no blood needed in this film for kids, already concentrating on mock alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. and the fuzzy thing-in-a-box? just what exactly was it? a porcupine? tasmanian devil? what, besides a really stupid plot device to help otis the cow win the mother of all battles? barnyard is a bomb. and i didn't even need to mention the udders.

i went to see this by myself first to make sure it was suitable for my little boy to see.thank goodness i did because i certainly would not allow any young child to see this. why? the violence, death, the funeral. if you are not ready to explain these concepts to your kids then keep them away.why on earth are these topics covered in a kids movie - especially one that has a tag line of "the original party animals". might as well put a gangland execution in a hello kitty cartoon.as for laughs there were very few and far between. speaking for myself there were none. the cows looked remarkably similar to the cows in the the far side comics. i guess there isn't anything original about this movie apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all the young kids to enjoy.

i can find no redeeming value to this movie. it appears to be loosely based on the lion king school of thought. father gets killed, son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away, etc, etc, etc. the only difference (other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle) is that barnyard tries to "liven things up" with club-type music. they go way over the top in trying to be cool. the problem is that it really isn't cool. it's like "that guy". everybody knows at least one of "those guys" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth. they try to be cool to fit in but they really aren't. that's this movie.but hey, if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away, by all means don't let me stop you.

it was so boring! no plot whatsoever! basically a watered-down version of the lion king mixed in with animal farm. again, no plot at all. horrible! worst hour and a half of my life!oh my gosh! i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief! i maybe chuckled twice. all of the semi-funny parts are in the previews. i hate movies like that. yeah, the movie pretty much sucked. i don't know how it got such good ratings and reviews. there is no plot or storyline!! if you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out. awful. i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much. it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.

let's see... a couple dozen gary larson gags, as well as his illustration style, a possibly legally difficult wholesale appropriation of an aardman character, a more than generous sprinkling of art direction from various pixar films, positively lion king-esquire villains living in what amounts to an elephant's graveyard in the middle of farm country, oh, and a stinking' riverdance joke ten years after any possible relevance. the kids (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a haul for dad. just another weak attempt from nickelodean films to hitch on to the animation explosion. i really, really wish they had spent a little more money on character design, on rendering, on a script, on a director.

words cannot describe how horrible this movie is. well, maybe they can. i'll take a stab at it: 1 - pitiful. hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics. apparently script and storyline aren't needed anymore.2 - violent. kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed.3 - blatantly stupid. the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities. in nemo, the fish could talk, but for the most part, they are still fish. we only hear the english as a translation. in barnyard, the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understand.4 - unintelligent - no smart story line or even any smart humor. (ok, the 13 year old dog on crutches was funny).5 - culturally insensitive - the "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. the pink cow is played by a white actress. the black cow was playing a stereotypical black person.6 - ignorant - no such thing as a male cow that i'm aware of. i believe we call them bulls? if we are going to expose our children to drek, it might as well have the simplest facts correct.7 - boring and borish. my 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes. he practically fell asleep.i'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate, because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. an unfortunate circumstance. why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way.

i took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and i would not recommend it for children their age. this movie had many fighting scenes throughout it, which i found too violent and my children found scary. the subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon geared towards children.i was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this, but it just did not cut it. if you have children under 7 years old, i would not recommend this movie.also, the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie.

i cannot believe the number of people referring to the lead characters as 'boy cows'!! there is no such thing people!!!! there are cows and bulls and all males in the bovine species are bulls and do not have udders!!!! there was even an actual bull but it was like it was another type of animal completely! my god this is like drawing human ears on a cat, boobs on superman, or mickey mouse with blond shirley temple curls - even in animation it just doesn't work! giving human qualities to the animals is nothing new & to be expected, but changing their actual bodies into basically a transsexual figure is bizarre for a family cartoon - how many people- editors, writers, producers, animators saw this and didn't know any better or didn't say anything- it is completely astounding! i'm no snob & i luv animation- simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even ice age & all the other new ones out there - over the hedge was great- but this is nuts - totally nuts- i could not accept that that many people are that ignorant & i kept hoping for a reason for the udders in the film - an explanation - none came - and at the end when they hold up this little newborn calf & half its belly is udder & they pronounce 'its a boy' i nearly choked!!!! please, writer/creator let us in on the joke!

hello - i normally love movies. i'm 19, i have seen many and dislike only one or two. this one though, the second it finished, i had to pull my sister (who had wanted to see it) out by the arm and i burst into tears of laughter as soon as i got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie. why it was awful: - all the cows had udders, especially bothersome were the male ones with udders - none of the characters were unique or engaging, except perhaps the main coyote dag - the idea of cows keeping watch against coyotes is just ridiculous - the 'funny' moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to out-do the last one - the themes of working together, which should have been present at the end, were nonexistent. instead, people get the impression: well, i'll take this all upon myself, and in this case i was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge - all the moments similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) were beyond corniness, even for a kid's movieand...the worst of all... it parallels the lion king in every single way responsible father figure who is killed by coyotes (the coyotes are essentially the hyenas, with dag, the lead coyote, being the equivalent of scar) the farm falls into chaos, odis (the cow, though basically simba) wants to play around, and is shocked that his dad died, believes it was his fault (even though in this movie, it was his fault), confronts the coyotes and gets an ass whooping, after which dag tells him to leave, and on the verge of leaving, odis somehow decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up (by complete surprise of course, he leaves without knowing they will come help him). other things taken from lion king: stars moving around as signs, father figures referring to stars/signs in a mystical loving way, the obviously circularness of how the father ben found odis and took care of him, and how at the end odis' love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience. birth at the end? good god, what the hell... and even similar type music, which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music.honestly, this is the first movie i have ever seen where i really was rooting for the bad guys - i never understood what other people were saying, until now.bottom line: don't waste your time to go see this. convince the kids not to see it, and re-watch the lion king. either that, or take them to see the ant bully, which was creative and artistic.

my boyfriend and i decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie worth seeing, even up there with "cars". within the first ten minutes of the movie, i was horrified. for starters, the cows, which should be females, had male voices. then i realized they really are supposed to be guys. i put the transvestite cows aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind, but it was just so corny i couldn't help but shake my head. i probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. the plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took way to long to reach its point. i was having trouble sitting through it, and i'm 19. the children in the theater were actually getting up and running up and down the aisles. i felt like joining them. but my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking references, not to mention that the cows/bulls actually hot wired and stole a car, then drank and drive, broke into a boy's house to push him out of bed (he deserved it though), then ran away from the cops, whom the writers of the movie made look like terrible people. this isn't the kind of thing i would want my kid to be exposed to. there's way too much of that in the real world, if i wanted my child to watch guys drink and drive and lead cops on a chase, i'd pop them in front of the 10 o'clock news. children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not an escape into ridiculousness. what happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast? that's why disney's old movies, like beauty and the beast, lady and the tramp, the little mermaid, etc. are classics. if you want your kids to see a great cartoon with basically the same plot as "barnyard", rent "the lion king". you can get a great story without the awful drinking and driving and grand theft auto references. the writers of "barnyard" were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a children's movie that a parent could enjoy as well, but they did so in very bad taste. i would never take my kids to see this, and i suggest you save your money and watch something else.

this series doesn't present the british view of the revolutionary war, so much as an anti-american view of it. the underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed british rule; that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw britain into a violent civil war; that the american supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist, violent louts, duped into the struggle. clearly, the intent of the author, richard holmes, is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics, in a straight line, from the american population of 1775 to today.for example, in the episode "the shot heard around the world" holmes dredges up an obscure print of the boston massacre, in which he claims the skin of crispus attucks, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution, was purposely "whited out". holmes claims that portraying attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. holmes never reveals how he knows this. and there's more. holmes goes to some length to work in a single, unsubstantiated, atrocity: the desecration of the body of a british soldier. he compares the american militia to the viet cong and the mujahadeen -- without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups. the list goes on.supposedly, this series was made in response to mel gibson's "the patriot". it says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to mel gibson on any topic. instead of presenting the british view, it seems holmes really wanted to give a sensationalistic, anti-american view, and, in the process, he's made himself the roger corman of historians -- strictly third-rate schlock.

there seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap, tired old sex "comedies" out there, that say the same old things about middle class couples. sort of like friends, but with more soft porn and no wit. this film is no exception- it had situations so familiar i died from deja vu. people sat on couches, spinning out clichés about sex and relationships? check. monogamy versus cheating with some woman/man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman/man? check. porn the baddies!!!!111? check. some guy/girl in it who happens to be the only reason you're watching this rubbish? check. the lesson seems to be- when it doubt, make a tired old sex "comedy" about people no one cares anything about, in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before. that'll get your film made. it'll even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad wig!

when i watched this movie it was an afternoon after i got home from work. i love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy ones, but this takes the cake. the plot presented to the viewer in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing, but as the movie progresses the script makes a wrong turn with horrible cliches and bad presentation, which in turn makes the movie completely dull and boring. i don't mean to keep criticizing the script and plot, because believe me that is not the worst part. i have to say as a whole the acting was not terrible for beginning actors, and i was impressed with taylor locke, this being one of his first movies. the worst part of the movie was the special effects. they reeked of low budget, and really ruined the viewers entertainment, even if he had been remotely interested in the plot. i do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.

oh god, why? i am aghast at the sheer ineptitude of this delicious blathering nonsense..as if all that makes sense. well, like this film from bottom rung poverty row of 1940s hollywood, nothing in this door slamming horror - made on three sets - makes much sense...except the horniness of dr markoff (jerkoff?) who lusts uncontrollably after some plonky piano-player's daughter who has big melons and a flouncy hairdoo. it is just terrible ...and even has a gorilla and a big dog for pointless added distractions. more elephantine than elephant man and that is just at 62 minutes!. ....the monster maker is the sort of film kids in 2005 just howl at with disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable movie kooks they are today. i guess you just had to be there. in 1944 or whenever the hell this mad drivel was shown to impressionable 13 year olds in glorious 3000 seat velvet movie palaces on a wet day. somehow. it was made for no reason, by botchville crapshooter movie scammers prc pictures in the war years by escaped german refugees who knew who to make a film since they got out of europe as the nazis advanced on ufa studios...the monster in this film, like the mad scientist is actually a nazi nightmare.

j carol nash and ralph morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a pianist's daughter. when his advances are spurned he injects the father with a disfiguring disease so that she will be forced to come to him to get a cure.god this is awful.its dull and boring and you'll nod off before the pianist gets uglified, i was on the verge. yea it picks up once things are set in motion but this is one of those old movies better remembered then seen again.if you must see it come in late4 out of 10

no one in this movie has very much to do. this is probably the longest 65 minutes i've ever spent watching a movie. the makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1. the doctor's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene. the director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a mad-doctor movie, but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them on. unless you know someone in the cast or crew, i wouldn't recommend even sampling this one.

not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires, touching our favorite trash/cult genre is nice. unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards. seem the creator's intention to make it cult it failed. trash movies are trash movies because it happens. you cant create in purpose this kind of films.i don't know if mr creepo is a legend (first time i heard his name) but if he is i wonder the reason...awful. even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic x-ploitation films will not be satisfied, as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires.

the emergence of quentin tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of guy ritchie may have triggered the wave of appalling british gangster flicks we've been bequeathed over the past few years, but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this. i only wish he'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs. it's not only stifling his talent, but possibly the promise of future originality from british films. not one of this film's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic, and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colourful language. caine doesn't give the material any more effort than it deserves, either. if this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la "king lear", it would've helped immensely had i cared about the ultimate fate of the principals, instead of just wishing that they'd get mired in the quicksand of life and dragged under almost immediately.

michael caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and character's around him where not likable or interesting at all. it was all very boring and somewhat predictable. martin landau , a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role.he was useless. michael caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down. don't waste your time. it starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that's about it. a film for die hard caine fans only. stay away from this one...

a vehicle for michael caine. its fairly well written and there's some ok acting in it but, really, it's a mess - not funny enough, not frightening enough. it's a flaccid modern cockney thriller.i like the premise - that even in the refracted moral hinterland of east london people do do things for the right reasons. a surprise result to the first proper fight caine's old-school billy shiner has promoted inflames his paranoia. the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first.my greatest disappointment was in director john irvin's failure to make more of the relationship between shiner and his lieutenant/filial substitute frank harper. harper's, a british tom sizemore, understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it. pity. 4/10

on paper this looks a good film . michael caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter who's son is up for a title eliminator . the pity is that when the story is transferred from paper to my television screen it loses a certain everything . i had hoped we'd be seen emulating his definitive role in get carter and as the film progresses it does seem to take on the qualities of a tough gritty revenge thriller but the whole tone of the film jumps around so much you'll be confused as to what genre it's trying to fit in to . for example caine ( who you can't believe in as billy " shiner " simpson , he's simply michael caine ) has a laugh out line as he refers to someone as " hattie jacques " then in a supposedly humorous moment has his henchmen break someone's arm . oh how i laughed . i mean it's supposed to elicit a laugh the way it plays out on screen isn't it ? but these seems at odds with the way the rest of the film plays out obviously director john irvin doesn't know what approach to take with scott cherry's screenplay . irvin isn't a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the dogs of war and hamburger hill but he's ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can't help but feel he might have been intimidated somewhat by a living legend like caine . caine does give the impression he's just doing it for the money and the well known faces in supporting roles like landua and cranham are basically just cameos who could be played by anyone

first off, this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise. you don't know what to feel. so much so that you don't feel bad for caines character when his son gets murdered (which was actually mostly due to bad editing). the script was too bland. none of the situations matter as you watch them. the soundtrack, or lack there of (if there was it wasn't good enough to even remember) does not help it one bit. only good surprise to this movie was andy serkis' performance. it was on par if not better than caine's. the story would have probably gone better off if serkis would have killed him. because quite frankly you don't feel any kind of redemption in the climax. just a feeling of lack of feeling, if ya feel me. basically this movie massively lacks draw. leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing.

as a true lover of film i must advise you to avoid this appalling effort,, god knows how funding was approved, seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again ,, the only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake possiby the worst film i have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent. one blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on 12x and it will only last 25 minutes, ,, and you won't miss any of the plotno idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks !

ok, we got jp from grandma's boy and chuck from, well chuck. i thought this movie would be quite good based on the reviews, and it did start out pretty high on my movie scale, but about halfway through it was just dragging out for so long i kept losing interest. i actually got so bored, probably because you can see right away what's going to happen in the end; the story is actually quite thread-bare, i skipped over 15 minutes and didn't miss a thing! this film should have been a short work, maybe around 45 minutes to an hour max. it starts out good and finishes good, too bad the filling is bland, boring, dull, and lacks everything but time. some people say they like it for the music; i don't care for jazz and i don't go see movies for their score, i go for the story and when that's drawn out... well, ratings drop in my book.bottom line: good open, great close, boring filler. story was cool, but if you don't know what's going to happen a quarter of the way through, you haven't seen too many thrillers.

decent but overrated dramatic thriller, film attempts to depict the spiraling out-of-control inner demons of a tormented artist. the problem is, not a single relationship illustrated on screen is believable, and plausibility appears to have been thrown out the window. the title character is so difficult to relate to making it's rather impossible to imagine any of the on- screen characters emotionally invested in him either. the conclusion is also fairly predictable; there are certainly enough clues provided from the get go to indicate exactly where the story is headed. choosing to entirely suspend one's belief in the situations or the relationships, the film itself is well acted (especially by the leads) and manages to create some nice tension as the story unfolds. as a metaphorical feature there is some food for thought, and had the script been stronger, there's certainly potential here that could have been put to better use.

in order to describe what's seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some *spoilers* so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this!i liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential. it is well acted, if a bit slow moving, and the camera work and portland scenes are exquisite for a low-budget, unpretentious picture. the dialog is very good. mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a telemarketing company selling insurance. his high school buddy, berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that mason is quite obviously mentally ill. mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler. his visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women. he meets a perky, pretty girl named amber and he sketches her in his notebook. she takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait. he sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state, almost becoming halfway human. then something goes wrong. amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. she becomes frightened and pulls away. we are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge. his behavior becomes more erratic. this is the setup for the revelation. in order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong i have to explain what happens. *another spoiler warning!* in order for this plot to work we have believe that amber, a really outgoing, pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesn't speak at all. he's way beyond nerdy, he appears on the verge of total catatonia. yes i know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but usually the charles manson type or punk rockers, guys with some kind of evil manic energy. mason is practically a zombie, he's hardly there at all. any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him. it is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him. moreover there is no credible reason for berkeley to indulge the crazy mason, that just isn't believable either. but wait, there's a revelation. amber fails to show up at berkeley's house for christmas dinner where mason is expecting her and berkeley, his old buddy, has to tell him that amber and all his other former girlfriends, the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks, don't exist at all! she and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. well, this explains why a normal cute amber would go for mason, she's just a figment of his imagination. this could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup, but alas, it's not. at this point mason runs back to his apartment and finds amber there...he's enraged, he kills her. but now we are given to understand that amber was in fact real, not mason's imaginary girlfriend. in the end, after being given proof that amber actually exists and that mason killed her, berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged mason. this would work if mason had been halfway sane from the beginning, but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us. we suspected what he was all along and can't understand why berkeley couldn't see it. but then we are once again left to wonder: if she was real, why amber would be attracted to the catatonic mason? to make the ending worse, we are never given to understand whether all the other of mason's girlfriends, the ones in the sketchbooks, were real or was amber the first real one? and if the others were real, did he kill them too? what did he do with the bodies? the problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story, but this movie is not that.

i approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. i sat down to watch it with this mindset, and was pleasantly surprised.it's not great. it's not even that good; in fact, it's pretty poor. however, it's not as bad as i had been led to believe, by a long shot. it's pretty inept, and, evidently as a cost cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is pressed into service, a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative.what it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. before you discount _glen or glenda?_ out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. me, i'd love to be able to draw, but anything i try to sketch comes out like stick men. i'd love to be able to sing, but all i do is frighten young children.wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work. however, this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s, however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance.

first of all, ed wood jr. is not the worst director ever, plan 9 from outer space not withstanding. coleman francis deserves that title. i present exhibit b, glen or glenda.the first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.this is not to say the movie doesn't have problems. bela lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines. poor bela looked like even he wasn't sure what was happening at times. the acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period universal b movie. the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre; more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence. the alan/ann story, the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it.no, ed wood jr. is not the worst director ever. he was able, at least for part of this movie, to make an earnest social statement. when coleman francis tried to do that in night train to mundo fine (aka red zone cuba), it just ended in chaos. glen or glenda is at least watchable without robot help.

bela lugosi as god? transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight-laced 1950s? by golly, this must be an ed wood film.watching this movie, i felt a combination of guilt, pleasure, and nausea all at the same time. the story is about glen (ed wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego glenda. somehow, if this movie were made now, i could see kevin kline playing glen/glenda. notice how all the cross-dressers' alter egos are versions of their male name (glen/glenda, robert/roberta, etc.). it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. somehow, wood manages to sneak in bondage and s&m sequences into his initial story of glen/glenda. along with these racy scenes, satan himself shows up, obviously having a bad hair day. the dialog and pace are nonexistent, but the film is enjoyable in its context -- the weird world of ed wood.sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one.

there's a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very courageous movie about transvestites, tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically (and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and trying very hard not to stereotype. the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals, and that aside from wearing women's clothing they lead a relatively normal life. it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society - the plot revolves around a police officer (lyle talbot) desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. so, you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial (in the context of 1953) subject.having said all that, i'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful. in trying to portray glen/glenda's (edward d. wood) pain, the movie falls into silly (and at times surprisingly - again given the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very hard to follow. the acting is wooden at best. none of the dialogue comes across as real; the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others. and - worst of all - there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie. this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career. "pull the strings; pull the strings," poor lugosi's character (called the spirit in the credits, but really coming across as more of a mad scientist) kept crying. and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie.for artistic merit, the movie doesn't really deserve much more than 1/10. however, for the courage involved in just putting it out, i'll give it a 3/10.

you could see the final outcome from a mile away.all the signs were there....the prom,the liquor,the fast ride,the distraction of the females.... a good commercial for seatbelt usage,and later model vehicles that sit the passengers further back from the windshield.also,the ending is rather anti climatic,as the ford econoline van barely suffers a crease across its nose after hitting a bridge abuttment at high speed (highly unlikely).more damage to the van would have made it a little more believable.and why do these films always take place during/after a prom? is it a case of once you survive the prom,you will be good for life? more than anything else,it shows the lack of policing the prom for liquor,and not keeping tabs on the minors who are leaving the dance for a joyride.

with such a promising cast and a director that i have heard great things about, i was utterly disappointed by this film. it started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes i did watch the full length version). i love robert deniro and as usual he did a fine acting job, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he kills, i always still had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a lowlife drug-addict, rapist with no care for anyone but himself. also, james woods, another fine actor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. i thought the parts where robert deniro called him crazy and he flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that's why james woods didn't like being called crazy. so much was left undeveloped in this movie. also, we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill noodles and we never find out more about joe pesci's character. it seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. the only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids. the story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job. overall, i was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and i don't see how anyone can even compare this to the godfather 1 and 2, or even goodfellas. i am sad that i wasted four hours of my life watching this film

it is high time that american critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned, sloppy veneration of films like sergio leone's 'once upon a time in america'. the checkered history of this opulent film (and the grand, fanciful myth associated with it's production and many versions) belies its mediocrity on a narrative level. the film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets, the minutia of production detail and the, by 1984, cliche'd but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience. the plot's time frame is confusing, gimmicky and laboured, leading some critics to imagine the noodles figure's opium binging to be the antecedent of some future 'dream reality' as well as the sepia-toned remembrances. this ham handed, overly fan boy-apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display. even at this full (?) running time, figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness: the deborah character is fleetingly established in child form, a cold and unattainable 'trophy' female, not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re-establish her relationship with a post-prison noodles, the said re-union henceforth rings completely false. the deadening pace is somewhat to blame, certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long, signifying very little, hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production, fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof. the trajectory of the figures' lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of america's teens through prohibition and its spoils, ending with the (arguable) ruin of its moribund central figures (save deborah- a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders). this notion is commonplace, even banal. the cast of characters as imagined in the one note script (written by seven italians no less) are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors, who at least venture a few variant facial expressions. this is understandable given the almost unworkable material. some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed, but actively seek their own goals, assuming the compliance of others (e.g. when noodles gets out of prison, max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming noodles will comply). this explanation of their abrupt, abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense. although ennio morricone's score is much revered, it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive, it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves, many violent, just do not warrant. at points it is questionable whether or not morricone was watching the same film i was so incongruous is his work. as a paean to american filmmaking, it succeeds in terms of mood (helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods) and visuals (not helped by said score) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity.

dare rudd (john wayne) and sidekick dink hooley (syd saylor) are itinerant cowpunchers who can't seem to stay in one place very long. in "helltown", the boys are headed to montana, where they meet up with rudd's cousin tom fillmore (johnny mack brown), who offers them a job. it's a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start out as cooks with the herd, although dare becomes self conscious when miss judith (marsha hunt) rides into camp. judy is tom's girl, but the attraction between her and dare is evident early on.fillmore has a cattle herd to move, and promotes dare to running the drive, partly to prove to judy that he may not be up to the task. meanwhile, bad guy bart hammond (monte blue) has his eyes on fillmore's cattle, but when his henchmen fail to rustle the herd, he figures it's easier to win the money that dare was paid at the end of the trail. conning dare into a rigged card game with his man brady (james craig), dare's money begins to evaporate hand after hand. it's only when dare fails to show up back at fillmore's ranch that tom goes out to find his cousin. exposing the cheats, tom, dare and dink high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge."helltown", also known as "born to the west", was released in 1937 by favorite films corporation, a couple of years after wayne's series of westerns for lone star productions. it only slightly alters the lone star formula; wayne does get the girl at the end of the film, but here he was trying. there's a great runaway horse scene where wayne rescues marsha hunt, in which johnny mack brown's horse does a complete somersault spill. syd saylor does a nice job as the comic relief pal, doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. he replaces familiar faces george "gabby" hayes and yakima canutt here, staples of the lone star films. john wayne's charisma is beginning to develop here, preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved. "helltown" was based on a novel by legendary western author zane grey. if you're looking for more films based on grey's stories, try "fighting caravans" with gary cooper, "the light of western stars" with victor jory, "drift fence" with buster crabbe, and "heritage of the desert" with randolph scott.

blake edwards' legendary fiasco, begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes. a combination of the eagle has landed, star!, oh! what a lovely war!, and edwards' pink panther films, darling lili never engages the viewer; the aerial sequences, the musical numbers, the romance, the comedy, and the espionage are all ho hum. at what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? this disaster wavers in tone, never decides what it wants to be, and apparently thinks it's a spoof, but it's pathetically and grindingly square. old fashioned in the worst sense, audiences understandably stayed away in droves. it's awful. james garner would have been a vast improvement over hudson who is just cardboard, and he doesn't connect with andrews and vice versa. and both andrews and hudson don't seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness. blake edwards' sob isn't much more than ok, but it's the only good that ever came out of darling lili. the expensive and professional look of much of darling lili, only make what it's all lavished on even more difficult to bear. to quote paramount chief robert evans, "24 million dollars worth of film and no picture".

1st watched 6/21/2001 - 2 out of 10(dir-emmanuel itier): pretty much worthless supposed thriller that spends more time drawing us into sexual encounters with and without the star 'amber smith.' it tries to wrap a story around the sex scenes but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well. i was so bored with this movie that i actually fast-forwarded thru the ending to get it over with. the video version i watched was called 'tell me no lies.'

only if you are crazy about amber smith should you see this. besides her svelte body there is pretty much nothing in terms of cinematic value. she even has a lesbian scene in this one. my guess is she is trying to metamorphize into those late night scream queens ala shannon tweed and julie strain.

i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one. what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters.don't get me wrong; i like pretty actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits, but this director does nothing else right.for example, take the scene where the two cops (of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them) are talking over while standing over the first dead body. the camera pans between them for each line, (there's more than one screen-width between them!) and you end up wondering whether you're seasick from that or the clueless dialog.well, it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes, but i wouldn't know. i declined the sucker bet and found something better to do.

it's hard to believe a movie can be this bad, but you live and learn. what's more amazing is the fact that the people who put this thing together likely had college educations. meanwhile, the fruit of their labor bares the appearance of something a group of five eighth graders may have come up with. on the bright side, (if there is one) the soundtrack has some nice moments, which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so hideously bad.

i ran across yvette mcclendon in a film at the los angeles film festival and thought she was a doll. after writing my review of her film there, i wanted to see more of her! found this movie, it was pretty bad. not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. bad directing. scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. amber smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. i really like yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. i can't believe i rented this trash to look for her. i hope to find her other movies.

i had heard about this movie through a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what i watched wasn't a "thriller". it was more like a weak attempt at one. amber smith was a bright spot-that may be giving her too much credit. the scenes were she was in bed with actress erika michels were also lame. the two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all. amber smith was way out of this gal's league, and it definitely showed on camera. she did not seem into those scenes at all. i was disappointed because a friend of mine-guy of course-had pumped this movie up to be something "great", but it was actually more like watching dime store porn.

the midnight hour aka: tell me no lies (as found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. one by it's merritt as a movie, complete with a plot (no holes), good story and believable conclusion and the other is by the skin flick it is trying to be. this is certainly no more than a b-movie skin flick, whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie in an overly long sex scene at least once.if you try to rate this as a regular movie, then this is bottom of the line drivel. huge plot holes ruin whatever storyline it has going for it. for instance, if a co-worker is killed, would you call the police or head home and hit the hot tub? judging this movie by it's skin content, it's watchable... barely. the girls, for the most part, are all beautiful but quite obviously enhanced. the sex scenes were all long and overdone, though, and that made it's only redeeming quality a little boring.amber smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted. she was not as horrible as you could imagine or maybe next to the rest of the cast, she seemed a lot better than she was.zoe anderson, who played detective arraya, should not even be watching a movie, much less acting in one. she looked good though, so we know why she was there.overall, i would not really recommend this to anyone. even if you're looking for a good skin flick, there are much better one's out there. i rate this 4 out of 10

this is very much overrated. i guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people. it has its moments, but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow. with this cast it could have been much better.

the female cast of this movie is terrific: you've got linda blair (maturing nicely), julie strain (who doesn't get too many speaking lines - that's a good thing), rochelle swanson (equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl), toni naples, and the most beautiful of them all imo, the simply stunning kristina ducati (how the goofy male lead, larry poindexter, deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery). however, beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women, the movie has little to offer. the plot is disjointed and doesn't really get going until the last 15 minutes or so; and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense, a ludicrous "twist" ending comes and ruins everything. (*1/2)

i'm just throwing in this review to show that i'm not crazy -- i like a lot of wynorski's work -- deathstalker 2, chopping mall, against the law are fast-paced and highly enjoyable -- just to prove i'm not blind, i have to mention this, along with some shannon tweed "body chemistry 3 or 4 or something", are the lousy ones -- i've got nothing against drawn-out sex sequences, but julie strain's breasts are so unnatural looking you can't help but stare at them - which may be the desired effect but i didn't enjoy staring at them -- and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested -- the "erotic thriller" was the worst thing to happen to low-budget flicks ever, and thank god that their day has more-or-less done.

***spoilers*** a hot and sexy linda blair as the witch amelia reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival witch across town erica barens, julie strain. amelia getting her husband hal, edward albert, to get a promotion at his job at the giger & greengrass law-firm over the more deserving larry barnes, larry poindexter, who happens to be married to erica has her cast a spell on hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself.larry finding out about erica's attempt on his best friend larry's life has a violent fight with her causing erica to fall from the balcony to her death. it's when larry goes back to his ex-wife carol, rochelle sanson, that things begin to really heat up, emotional and sexually. the wicked amelia tries to have the dead spirit of erica take over carol's body and end up murdering larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband hal's injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair.not much of a story but lot's of cheese and soft-core action with poor larry getting manipulated by amelia through the resurrection of erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her. amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn't a threat to her. amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener stan, michael parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break-in, then his mind, by being accused by the police as being the murderer, and finally is life, by getting blasted by ameila herself. as he's made to runs into the reynolds' house, under her control, as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled hal. larry parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of "sorceress" and ended up being in the cast playing his part as stan. without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is. stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn't have to suffer,like those of us watching, through the entire brainless and mind-numbing movie.it becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of "sorceress" that all this shenanigan's on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie. the ending is about the best thing, besides miss blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast, that one can say about the film.

my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it. however, the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show. it ended with a typical end-the-season cliff hanger leaving it's fans feeling cheated. a waste of great writing and acting.

well, in all honesty it's beyond the boundaries of stupid, but "killer pussy" is still one insanely entertaining little flick. no plot, tons of oiled up cha-chas, cheesy effects, and a penis eating monster! what's not to love?! pretty much - a couple of explorers find this creature that likes to nestle itself within a woman's beef curtains until a schwang is unfortunately... ah, thrust into its mouth. it finds it's host who is later discovered frozen in a deserted house by a group of moronic guys and their equally brainless, slut girlfriends whose van breaks down. the creature jumps from each girl as they all fornicate like drunken rabbits... there's some cheap gore, girl-on-girl "blood wrestling", ky jelly vomit, sock-puppet monsters and lots of soft-core sex. ridiculous but a cool waste of time...

lucille ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical.the movie features some of the worst choreography ever seen laced with the constant threat that lucy might break into song with her bourbon voice at any moment. lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and aside from die-hard lucy fans, no one is likely to fancy it very much. bad costumes and cheesy set designs don't help. further proof that lucy wasn't good at anything except making stupid faces.directed by gene saks.

some good set design. good songs, though like the other guy said they aren't performed with much energy. bea arthur, trying her damndest to do something with the material, had an occasional good one-liner as mame's friend vera and helped move the song "bosom buddies" along. other than that, there's nothing here that's worth your time. slow pacing, incredibly bad cinemetography, not very good singing (except from robert preston), an awful script, bad acting (except from bea), and a horrible lead actress. who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy, life-loving mame? the heads over at warner bros. were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury, who had done it so well on broadway, and instead use ball, who wasn't nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier, couldn't act the part "the right way" at all, and used a painful croak as an excuse for singing. even if (perhaps because) making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she financed it, she just isn't mame. auntie mame is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great. for the most part, there's nothing here that's great, engaging, or interesting at all. forget it, unless you're a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong. hopefully after seeing this you'll realize she was only human.

in 1967 i saw an outstanding musical at the wintergarden in new york city where angela lansbury lite the stage as mame. but did hollywood give her the lead ???? no lucille ball great as lucy was given the role. she killed the film. what a mistake there was no chemistry as there was on the stage bea arthur and angela what a twosome when they sang.. it is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today

who the heck had the "bright"(?) idea of casting lucille ball in this film??? it should have been angela lansbury's baby all the way. at the very least lucy should have had her singing dubbed. there is some compensation in the fact that jerry herman's score is pretty well kept intact except for "that's how young i feel", and we do get performances by the original broadway cast members jane connell and bea arthur. i suppose robert preston had to be given a song, hence the inferior "loving you". overall, i think in this one the wrong redhead was cast.

i am a big fan of "auntie mame" with rosalind russell. she really was the perfect actress to play that character.i've heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in "mame" but it's hard to imagine anyone topping rosalind russell.lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really, they should have dubbed her singing voice - hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect. i just saw the stage revival in washington d.c. and i think christine baranski was very good as mame, harriet harris - the nasty chain smoking agent on frasier - played vera and she was particularly good.both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show. maybe if that production makes it to broadway they'll consider filming it.also i think tracy ullman would be good as agnes.

lucille ball cannot sing or act or dance. this makes the quality of her performance in mame all the more dreadful. she's not allowed to do the low-brow slapstick that made her a hit on tv so she has to rely on building a character. unfortunately, ms. ball never learned that skill as none of the tender moments have any warmth. how does she really feel about patrick or beau? we never really believe the words she says. that vacant stare of ms. ball is suppose to convince us she is emoting but there is no chemistry between her and bruce davidson, robert preston or bea arthur at all. for this reason every scene she's in is flat.moreover, when ms. ball opens her mouth to sing we are immediately made aware of the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career. it was stated that she demanded her voice be used so this is a mistake of ego as well as leadership. it is made worse when she is singing in voice-over and she has to "act the moment" without words. whoever thought that would work forgot who was playing mame.i understand that rosalind russell did the role on stage and in the film auntie mame. also, i am aware that angela lansbury won a tony for her performance in the original 1966 broadway musical. neither of these women were known for their singing voices, but both could have pulled this off better than lucille ball. why they went with her is the worst in blatant miscasting.the only person that gets out unscathed is bea arthur. she's big and wonderful, catty and common in all the right amounts. unfortunately, you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun. but the film never does and you can't. no one besides bea arthur appears to be having any fun.an additional bad review goes to director gene saks. saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and screen, including the broadway musical this film is based on. none of that skill and expertise is of aid here. the poor editing and storytelling quailty in this movie is beneath a director of his caliber. that glaring error in the execution of the movie is not the fault of ms. ball.

to begin with, i really love lucy. her tv show still makes me laugh. she was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived, right up there with chaplin and keaton. but, her performance in this movie is disappointing. she was too old, and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a london fog refugee. she couldn't sing, and her voice was so froggy that she croaked through every song. her dancing days were long in the past. just because you are a lucy fan, don't gloss over this mistaken, sad performance and sing it's praises. i prefer to remember lucy in her wonderful tv series(i love lucy) and to draw the curtain of charity over the terrible mess of a movie called "mame".

this movie was so awful, so boring, so badly miscast -- it took a lot of work to make what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty. i love lucille ball, but she absolutely stunk in this movie. too old, couldn't sing, sounded like a truck dumping gravel even when not singing -- and the biggest sin of all -- she wasn't funny. even a little. the studio shot themselves in the foot with this one, and for ruining what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous stage musical, some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well -- or perhaps they were already lacking those parts. that might explain it. but for lucy to think she was right for a part that required singing -- well, that's the saddest thing of all. it's a very good thing to know your limitations. even a legend can't come out of a stinker like this and still smell like a rose.

some of the early talkies survived to become classics. 1929's "the squall" is a classic all right, but not in the way it was intended. melodramatic in story and acting, today it seems ludicrous, particularly the casting of myrna loy as nubi, a seductive gypsy. imagine nora charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal. outrageous! however, as many people know, when loy first came to hollywood, she did quite a few of these exotic seductress roles.based on a play, "the squall" concerns the aforementioned gypsy who in the film is now in hungary (spain in the play) running away from her cruel master and inviting herself into the home of the lajos family (richard tucker and alice joyce), basically by appearing at the door. one by one, nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm talking her pidgin english ("nubi not bad! nubi do nothing wrong!") and dropping hints about nice presents. the son in the family, paul (carroll nye) is engaged to the beautiful irma (loretta young) and can't wait to marry her. he loses interest when he meets nubi.with the exception of the lovely alice joyce, zasu pitts as a woman who lives in the household and the stunningly beautiful loretta young, the acting is uniformly awful. loy is stuck with the hallmarks of her character - bad english, whining and hysteria. with her darkened makeup, peasant getup and curly hair, she is not only beautiful but right out of the 1980s - quite modern, though richard tucker's putting the back of his hand on his forehead reminds us we're just emerging from the silents.robert osborne on tcm commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures. while it is deliciously bad, it's not deliciously bad enough to sit through again. it's just bad - but a great example of how far we've come and, had someone not picked up on myrna loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career might have been.

no one is going to mistake the squall for a good movie, but it sure is a memorable one. once you've taken in myrna loy's performance as nubi the hot-blooded gypsy girl you're not likely to forget the experience. when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens, often asian and usually sinister. she's certainly an eyeful here. it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled. in most scenes she's barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loose-fitting peasant blouse, while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel. i suppose i'm focusing on miss loy's appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching. you sure won't be attracted by the dialogue, which is hopeless. in one typical passage, nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic: "always the gypsies, they sing. weird and sad. when the big sun have breath of fire that burn, and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death, they sing." poetic, or what? lovers of purple prose will have a field day. i can't help but wonder, though, if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project.like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success. the stage version opened at the 48th street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year. the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert benchley, who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english. according to a much-repeated anecdote mr. benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show. the spanish village setting (moved to a village in hungary for the movie, for some reason) gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but benchley's patience reached its limit when, during a family dinner sequence, a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting "help! help! he keel me!" she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed "me nubi! me good girl! me stay here!" at that point mr. benchley rose and announced to his companion: "me bobby. me bad boy. me go now," and left the theater.the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchley's level of wit. the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family: father josef, mother maria, and son paul, a student at the nearby college. we would consider this prosperous family "upper-middle class" as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by, yes, nubi the nubile gypsy girl. she arrives at their door during the storm of the title-- symbolizing stormy emotions, i daresay. the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary. after considering the matter the lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover, who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away. nubi becomes a servant in the household. kindness motivates the family's decision to take her in, but soon enough that conniving little good-for-nothing nubi has paid them back by seducing every able-bodied male in the vicinity, starting with the lajos' servant peter, then working her way up to son paul. nubi breaks up paul's relationship with his fiancé irma (played by loretta young, still a teenager), causes him to flunk out of school, and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the family's maid lena (zasu pitts). lena, for her part, is still mourning the loss of her own fiancé peter, seduced and tossed aside by nubi when she turned her attentions to paul. ultimately nubi sets her sights on the pater familias josef, and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also would've gone after uncle dani, maria, the village priest and god knows who else.i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody, but during its first half the squall nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap: we watch, hypnotized, as the bad girl works her spell on the men-folk and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature (almost like-- a storm! ah-haa, another metaphor!). but as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades. during the later scenes nubi is de-emphasized and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the lajos family, and after awhile these people get to be a real drag. the son in particular behaves like an absolute heel, yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings; everything, we're told, is the fault of nubi, that no-good tramp.the men of the cast are dull. aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is zasu pitts, terrific as usual. the mother of the lajos household is played by alice joyce, a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles, and who retired soon after this. loretta young's fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to nubi's dusky allure, but her line readings are so awkward it's kind of endearing. no, there's only one reason to watch this flick, and that's nubi herself. i can't think of another actress who could've played this silly role and managed to come off half as well. i'm not an objective observer, however. i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything, even the squall.

this is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows, a certain dixie boy johnson. whether this person ever really existed i don't know, but considering the cast lists a certain "lee lasses white" and roscoe karns playing said character as well, i assume the man did exist and that this is a white-washed (pardon the pun) version of his career. the plot, such as it is, follows dixie boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth, his abandonment of the child to friends, and his return at his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation. another forgotten man, benny fields, plays dixie boy. the man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen. gladys george valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail. judy clark does the best impersonation of betty hutton i've ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself. the scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar nom. worth a look.

this movie starts with interesting set design and a promising premise, but fails to provide the cult-movie goods. set in a gritty parallel universe where everything is owned by the "blump" corporation, it concerns a horrible stand-up comic who finds success when he grows a third arm out of his back.all the potential for great cheese is here -- washed-up 80's star judd nelson, wayne newton, offbeat visuals and strange plot digressions, obese women in skimpy lingerie, necrophilia -- but it never pays off.the pacing is the main problem. each scene is excrutiatingly slow. nelson's stand-up routines are supposed to be funny because they're pathetically not funny. but each performance drags on until it's not even tangentially funny, just boring.imagine someone telling you the longest, weirdest joke imaginable, full of smirky self-congratulation for how funny and weird he thinks it is. imagine after a stultifying two hours of this, you never got a punch line. you've just saved yourself the trouble of watching the dark backward.

i have had this movie, in the back of my head sense i saw it. i have wanted to tell people about it time and again, but never remembered. now i found it. now finally, i can tell people precisely what the absolute worst, most crappy movie i have ever seen in my entire life, bar none is.this movie is complete trash, and is unfit for a garbage dump. all prints and other copy's of this movie should be rounded up loaded into a large rocket, and launched into the sun. only the purifying heat and pressure of the sun might be able to purify the materials this movie is stored on, so that they can be useful to the universe again.i like movies. i like bad movies. and yes this is an opinion. but this movie was pure trash, filth, and excrement of some beast that should never be seen let alone named by man.i would rather watch a uwe boll movie marathon than watch this movie. and i hate uwe boll's films.

. . . and never, ever see it. now, i've been watching bad scifi movies for years. i love watching bad scifi movies. i think that was the only reason i could watch this movie the whole way through. i was toughened up by "nukie," "indian superman," and that awful "fantastic four" movie, just to name some examples. usually, i have to beat my head against the wall after i've seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away. no, not with this one. with "tdb," i had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. temporary fix. i can't believe i wanted to see that. i cried. when it finished, i cried. it was horrible. it was worse than when i saw *shudders* wil wheaton in his underwear in "the curse," which, by the way, never watch either. aside from the fact that wesley crusher's in his tighty whiteys, it's just sooo bad. but this review is about "tdb." the worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said, "this deserves to go on film! it's great!" and wayne newton, rob lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "oh, this is what i want on my film history!" i'll watch "indian superman" until the cows come home, but i am never going to see this steaming pile of dren again.

this movie has no heart and no soul; it's an attempt to whomp up a cult film out of the leavings of other, better, directors, principally david lynch and tim burton. rifkin seems to think that if he overloads on a kind of rotted visual style and fills the street with crud and garbage, he's making a statement. but it's not a statement about anything -- except the director's shrill shriek of "hey look at me! i'm an artist, too." but he doesn't have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for things that worked -- such as some of the actors trapped in this -- for other directors. all of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid, boring chore to sit through.

a friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. i was curious, because it had developed a bit of a cult status. i like a lot of odd indie cult movies so i gave it a shot. i have to agree with my friend. it is a steaming pile of dung. i am sorry to the people who love this movie, but i can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film. try peter jackson's dead alive (aka braindead), cemetery man (aka dellamorte dellamore) , or modern vampires.

this 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel. we wanted to see another film, which supposedly was starting, but because a mix up, rent-a-cop, was shown in that time slot. never having seen it when it was commercially released, we took a chance at it. bad decision.one wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with "rent-a-cop", or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. it appears this movie misfired big time. this film doesn't add anything new to its genre. it's totally predictable, as once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end.burt reynolds plays a wooden church. this actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction given to him by jerry london, had the opposite effect. mr. reynolds has one expression throughout the movie. he just doesn't register any emotion at all.lisa minnelli, as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the chicago hotel, makes no sense at all. the romance between her della and church seems phony from the beginning. she and mr. reynolds play one dimensional characters.don't waste your time with this turkey.

i was sick one day and was skimming channels and i came upon this terribly rank movie. the plot and even the subplots (if you can find one) have been done to extinction. but, as bad as the story was, i reserve a special comment for liza minelli. her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters i have ever has the misfortune of seeing on film. her only two competitors in this category are john leguziamo in "the pest" and julia stiles in anything she's done (or half-done). maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe (groan!) that is the limit she has to her acting range. either way, they should have had a rewrite and killed her off in the first 30 seconds of the film (eg. like the girl that fell off the balcony in lethal weapon (i) (but at least she had nice breasts))most humbly submitted...douglas neidermeyer

a low-rent, cheaply made police thriller that's kept bearable by some fair humorous bits, the nice chemistry between the two leads and, especially, by james remar's satisfying turn as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and, naturally, indestructible) villain. obviously a low-quality picture, both visually and dramatically, with a rather resigned burt, but not unwatchable. (**)

live action version of dragonball via taiwan.evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls...er pearls which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish. lots of action and bad comedy ensue.what can i say that "the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends" doesn't? i don't know. this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be. come on this is one of the few martial arts films i've ever seen where you actually see the wires. its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what i've seen of the show that it makes me fearful for the big budget american version now filming.if you have some drunk friends and feel like picking on a movie see this film. if you're going to see it sober (like me) avoid it.

when you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before. keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent insane amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter. the crazy thing i noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (i wonder if the hong kong version was dubbed too?) i understand the cartoon had this, but it doesn't work for live-action. it just looks odd... as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors.the english version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. i would have preffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, i'll let it go. but there is something extremely odd about this movie. it's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about sex, rape, and stripping which isn't exactly for young western audiences. (in the orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). but parents be warned! there is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! who was this movie made for anyway?oh, and the special effects are laughable. you can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, i wasn't sure) that look unconvincing, even to a kid. the makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon, simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need. i didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as dragon ball z.i don't really recommed this movie to anyone. kids, adults, or dragon ball z fans. it's just a poor representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it. i won't even get into the camerawork... just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes... most of the shots are not framed correctly at all and the movie just seems made by amateurs. grainy film quality too.just all around horrible!!!!

just an hour ago i finished watching this my friend. as a fans of dragonball we think that this movie is so bad that is good. we will say one thing : without a sixpack beers there is now way you can survive through this movie. this movie should be watched with a many dragonball fans to laugh their ass off. the best character in the movie is the lord horn, his makeup, his laugh, and behaviour crates the unforgettable experience. what we liked in this movie, was the fact that the island of turtle man was the same as in cartoon version. we believe that the only character similar to the one in the cartoon is the turtle man. he is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot too.

mr. brento wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the dragonball z tv series. of course not.this is a hong kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the japanese original cartoon (which was also based on a comic book series). and i really don't know if it was produced under the license of the dragonball creators...however, the story of the monkey-boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over asia (in japan, the name of the boy in the tale is songoku; in china, it is sunwukong; in korea it is sonogong; etc) and the story in dragonball has much to do with that tale.by the way, as i said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the dragonball series (which was followed by dragonball z, although i think the us version had a different airing order). and all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without so much overacting and so much insistence on it!), but because of your comments i may suppose they were completely removed in the american dubbing.anyway, i agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is. but maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it...

not well done at all, the whole movie was just the grudge going around and killing random people out of nowhere. random people that have nothing to do with the story get killed, like the 3 school girls for example.the family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story either, i believe them to be a random family that never went in the house, and never had anything to do with the killings of the grudge.did not impress me at all, i was not scared, i didn't jump at any parts, and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of. makes the gridge 1 look like crap also, which was actually an alright movie.i believe that the grudge 2 is like a leading movie to the grudge 3, if they ever make one. they shouldn't have even called this the grudge 2, they should of called it the prologue to the grudge 2, and you will see if you watched it, because i am not going to spoil anything. not that it would have mattered anyway.1/10, not scary, bad story, and is just completely random.

spoilers ahead jeeeeeeeesussssssssss.... i have a saying: "insecticides kill insects and moronicides kill morons..." the "ghost" in this movie kills morons. several of the people who get killed in this movie are actually asking to get killed, by running into abandoned houses, going after ghosts, etc...on a strictly cinematic aspect, this movie sucks real bad. the three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly, we learn they are separated by at least a few days. it's a cheap shot...also, the "thrills" are so cheap, they are laughable. even "nightmare on elm street" didn't sink so low as to show someone being attacked by his own sweater... it's pathetic.save your money, stay home, and you won't have a grudge against the filmmakers..

my best guess is this piece of work will come out on dvd sometime before christmas.this movie was terrible. the time line jumps all over the place. this wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end. it was entirely predictable. bitch girls pick on outcast, outcast wants to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die a terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. outcast girl brought evil spirits with her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. creepy kid understands what's going on. oh, and the younger sister not being good enough for mommie, sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home. to be fair, there were some great moments here and there. first of all, sarah michelle geller's character dies in the first few minutes. definite plus. didn't see that one coming. i didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head, either. if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills, i would have loved it. the beginning showed so much promise. i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one. it made me jump, i didn't expect most of what happened, and though i questioned some of the movie, it was still a fun watch. i didn't watch any previews for this the sequel, because i wanted to be surprised. i was, but in the wrong direction.

all i can say about this movie, is it is absolutely boring. the intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film i have ever seen, i mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn't at all frightening which is what i assume the director was aiming for, but in fact it was "mildly" funny. the acting in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors, if your making a horror film, please hire some good actors, not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act.the death scenes in this movie were beyond boring... no gore, and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are just cheesy. i mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of tokyo, and not one person sees it happen, they just declare her as "missing", wow thats awesome!in conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure u bring some sleeping pills, because i guarantee you won't make it to the end.. me and my friend walked out cause we didn't even care what happened at the end.cheers

i loved the first grudge, i watched it in an empty theater,and in all honesty, i was freaked out. never before had i heard the unique audio of chilling sounds, it truly was gripping.the grudge 2 however, had a couple of good jumps, but the story line was real messy, and not entirely believable, and all over the place, with a couple of scenes, (like a female urinating herself out of fear, or another one of a young woman drinking a jug of milk then vomiting it all up again) which really made no sense, and did not help to enhance the creep factor of the film. during these scenes, and a couple of others, people in the sold out audience actually laughed out loud. that was a good indicator to show how this film lacked the thrills, chills, or creeps. the acting was decent, the emotions portrayed were believable, so hats off to the actors, but the cluttered storyline and its lack of direction was something i couldn't shake throughout the entire movie. i was annoyed more than anything, same old grudge gagging noises, a couple of quick unexpected scenes to make me jump, but overall, i was very disappointed.

to start off, i didn't bother seeing the grudge. the previews for that movie didn't make me jump, didn't scare me, and didn't entertain me. but when a group of friends asked me to go see the grudge 2, i accepted the invite, a little curious as to how this movie would be. i mainly went because of my friends. not even 5 minutes into this movie, i realized i threw away $7.50. the acting from the get-go is horrible. the schoolgirls in the beginning look as if they have never acted in their entire lives. then, the movie plot takes over. let me tell you, i could not stop laughing this entire movie. it is just so stupid. i'm pretty sure they tried to not make it scary. they don't make anything jump out or anything. it shows the kids, then shows them "attacking". it builds up to it, it's not an "all-of-a-sudden" thing. and even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the acting is still horrible. it leaves so much time in-between the dialog for someone to add in their own comments. this movie is honestly one of the funniest "horror" movies i have ever seen. poorly written, horrible acting, horrible script, horrible "unable to act" cast, and a horrible concept. the movie blacks out and changes situations more times than you can count. each part eventually plays out and then ties up at the end of the movie. i would never again pay to see this movie. i wouldn't even watch it on cable, for free. this movie is a joke. please do not waste your money on this movie!!

i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the octopus at the end. the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor. the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus. everybody, especially the police captain, refuses to believe nick's story, and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the 4th of july celebrations...in this movie we get to see more of the giant octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for it's time.the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able. the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that, you should enjoy the rest of movie. 5/10

when i saw the first octopus movie it was a laugh see the cheesy acting and appalling effects. this film seemed to make up for the acting, but not the special effects. after jaws and piranha, sure, why not make a film about a killer octopus? the octopus invades the new york waters, where 2 police investigators try stopping the rampaging beast before the 4th of july.a pretty clean plot and descent happenings but the octopus was pretty much appalling, its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic... better on a big budget really, this film could have been a good watch. there's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way octopus live...watch this if you like cheap dvd sequels, otherwise your better watching jaws.

during the summer, the cue line for this attraction is really long, since it is a water ride. it's very well-themed, but a lot of the ride's artifacts seem to be out of order. overall, the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hrs. in line. the drop at the end is exciting, but the whole ride itself could have been better. creators for indiana jones could have prob. helped these hollywood designers. also, many times the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others. it's also very unpleasing when they only have one raft departing dock open and not the two, like they are supposed to. during halloween horror nights, you ride in the dark, and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, then don't bother waiting in a four-hour line.

the salena incident is by far the director, dustin rikert's, best film --- which isn't saying much. in his past films (and i use the term "films" loosely), the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them. the salena incident is no different. the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production. the film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes. for example almost every on-screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen.the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. in a sentence, the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clichés. the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate. next a bus of prison transports, carrying the worst of the worst from across the state, is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants. the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who... shock... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. the prisoners, and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance *rolls eyes* bombs the city into oblivion.the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire. other than that, the movie really isn't worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of. how awful was it? let's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old, works in a room that is about as high tech 1950's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie. yes, if that wasn't clear enough before, the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it. the movie basically culminates (hahahahhaaa did i say culminates...) with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens --- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship? yeah...the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant, chest-level shots. this movie really isn't worth renting (if it ever makes it that far) being that it's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh-ability, but it's nowhere near watchable cinema.

what could have been some majorly creepy stuff ends up being an incomprehensible, nutty motion picture that even the filmmakers themselves probably didn't understand. had they shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever, it might have been creepier, but as it stands now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. is anybody else getting sick of the whole "little kid drawing creepy pictures with crayon" thing? could there possibly be a bigger horror cliché? probably not. i know, i know, it's from some different country, and it's far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so i shouldn't expect the "plot" to be spoon-fed to me, blah, blah, blah. whatever. i still say the movie blows.

developing movies that are based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. you have to mainly reconcile reported testimonies, conflicting info sources, and hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can get into. unfortunately, for sasquatch, none of these things seem to take place.the movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the cascades via airplane. from there the research team disappears, and despite attempts from law enforcement officials and local rescue parties they remain missing for some time. while one of the passengers is walking, infra-red-like images are splashed on the screen (a la predator) which subtly hint that the legendary sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fates.cue harlan knowles (henriksen), ceo of biocomp industries and father of one of the crash victims. knowles puts together his own search & rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research crew, along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash.after knowles' tailor-made rescue team is put together, the entire movie traverses down the path of uncolorful characters, dizzying cinematography, and a totally unoriginal plot line. i literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to frighten me out of my wits. the only member of the cast that held his own was henriksen, which doesn't make up for the lack of depth presented in all of the other characters. the over-done sound effects were annoying as well; basically, i didn't know if i was watching a movie about bigfoot or grizzly bears.neither was the plot line all that great. it was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subjected to typical fright music found in anything similar of the genre. obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie, or who'd be the first unlucky soul to get mauled by mr. sasquatch. as far as good points, there are none, and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10.

harlan knowles (lance henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (erica durance). what they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (taras kostyuk) and it's still out there... waiting for them.it was a late night when i poped this into my dvd player. i seriously wish i could go back in time and stop me. most people will tell you that films like "house of the dead" or "s.i.c.k: serial insain clown killers" will be the movies you wish you've never seen. wrong. this will be.i've seen a lot of crap, but this is the only crap that's haunted me. how i wish i never watched this! the acting actually isn't so bad. it's just the writing and the directing and the pacing and everything! i am actually a fan of sasquatch films. but not this one.please, listen to my warning. don't watch this!

(r#64)unredeemable, merit-less, and above all dreary trash. you know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is lance henriksen. the french title for this movie says it all: "inexplicable". how can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age? whatever jonas quastel's trick is, it worked. this is über-trash, i'm talking 'manos'-level crap, meaningless, unwatchable, not-even-so-bad-it's-good, cinematic bile of the highest order.lance henriksen is harlan knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality. he, along with a bunch of morons, goes on a field trip to search for an evil sasquatch which is believed to have attacked a plane which crashed out in the woods, or something. not much else happens. there's some soft-core (meaning: teletubbie level) nudity and some blatant rip-offs of "predator". after 92 minutes of utter pain and another ripped off scene, this time from "blair witch", the movie finally staggers across the finish line and ends. as a bonus, we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie.there's really not much to say about this film. all you need to know is, this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a "so-bad-it's-good" flick. "the untold" is to entertainment value what orlando bloom is to character acting. avoid it like arsenic.

lance used to get quality support work from james cameron. heck, he even had his own tv show (millenium) for a coupl'a seasons. why is he doing this? couldn't he find some better way to pay his bills?i love a good low-budget movie. some of them you can laugh at simply due to their ludicrous premise, their textbook stereotyped characters, or often times because the actors are related to the director/producers. but, this movie has no redeeming value. i didn't laugh. i didn't cry. i only had this sick feeling in my stomach. that feeling was quickly identified as pity. at one point, lance henriksen was an a-list support actor. he's been in terminator (he was going to be terminator before arnold showed up), aliens, aliensiii, classic b-movie pumpkinhead, among so many others! i wanted to send him money after this. maybe we should start a support lance fund or something.then again, for making this thing...maybe not.

a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the ceo's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest. when the search and rescue mission is called off, the ceo, harlan knowles (lance henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? oy, what a mess this film was! it was a shame, because for one, it stars lance henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. it suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director jonas quastel's fault--this film (which i'll be calling by its aka of sasquatch) has just about the worst editing i've ever seen next to alone in the dark (2005), and quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, "okay, let's try that again, but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible".the potential was there. despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator (1987)), ed wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. the monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. the monster's "lair" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers (2001). if it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective.but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made: for some reason, quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a, then a few lines of scene b, then back to a, back to b, and so on.for some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.for some reason, he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. he just cuts to them at random. for that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random. important events either never or barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes.for some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and "humanity" could have easily been shown in another way).for some reason, there is a whole character--mary mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous.for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.for some reason, characters keep calling harlan knowles "mr. h", like they're stereotypes of asian domestics.for some reason, quastel insists on using the "blurry cam" and "distorto-cam" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.i could go on, but you get the idea.i really wanted to like this film better than i didi'm a henriksen fan, i'm intrigued by the subject, i loved the setting, i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but i just couldn't. every time i thought it was "going to be better from this point until the end", quastel made some other awful move. in the end, my score was a 3 out of 10.

there's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time. i've seen "pumping iron ii", "aces: iron eagle iii", "raven hawk", and even the tv movie "getting physical", which featured some big names in the sport. they were tolerable in their own ways (mostly, because they featured rachel mclish. rowwr!!).then i went and watched "nemesis iii: prey harder", on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as sue price, debbie muggli, sharon bruneau and ursula sarcev. love the ladies, always will, but after this i'm kinda glad i missed the first two "nemesis" flicks.well, the first one, anyway. most of the footage here is lifted bodily (and kicking and screaming, i would guess) from "nemesis ii". actually, that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here.but even though price and company flex and pose, they don't get much of a chance to do anything else (like, say, act!). in fact, this whole film is an exercise (get it? ha-ha...) in oblique story-telling, ambiguous characters and open-ended movie-making (in terms of filming as well as the story-line). nothing makes much sense but even if it did, there would still be issues - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women as these. what a crime.of course, it was written and directed by albert pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion?one star only, in consideration for all the hard work that price, muggli, bruneau and sarcev obviously put into their bodies, not the "craft" work done within the movie itself.thanks, ladies.

nemesis 3 is the worst movie what i have ever seen!!! i think that nemesis 3 was only 30 minutes long. and that movie was so boo-oo-ring. when that movie ends and i saw word: nemesis 4... i thought i will...not watch that movie never again.

perhaps the worst of the "nemesis" films (and that says a lot!), this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you've seen them both, even if you've only endured this entry. making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value. in other words, they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake.

i got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because i remembered seeing the first of the series when i was a kid. i'd rented the second one and it was a decent "b" sci-fi. this one was out right obnoxious. the "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. the two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that i literally cringed every time they came on the screen. the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. i don't know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but i'm sure that they'd have done better to have left it at 2 movies. the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. i only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device.

this is going to be my first review on imdb and i'm glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i don't have to change anything...first there are awful movies. movies you can make a laughter out of, like island city, battlefield earth or conan the destroyer. that is totally acceptable. they makes a great party enhancer. then there are the worst movie ever. i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was.i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like sci-fi, terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff like that. everything on the box art was very promising. then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was... what? there was maybe 10 minutes (or more) of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that makes you puke. and it just continues over and over. then some "acting" kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world, where this abomination of mankind actually exists... and then i realized, there are actually two prequels. i didn't think about it first, but the title says "3" in it... and i was horrified. but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end, i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe... but then a little text showed up saying... "next..." and... nemesis 4?!?!?! no please no!!!!!!!!

i really wanted to like this film. the second film in the series had this silly, drive in movie feel to it that was fun (of course, i was also drunk). i watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity, a-la- mystery science theater 3000. i was wrong!!!!! this movie is a god awful waste of film, and i liked the second one!!!! from the effeminate villain with the david bowie fright wig, to the tacky, obnoxious female villains with laughs that could strip the paint off a garage door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. i actually felt bad for sue price, because the material was beneath an actress of her stature (that pretty much says it all). an awful, awful film (that's not a recommendation).

robert downey jr. in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder, but i couldn't believe a great actor like sam neill actually took a part in this movie. the whole thing was unbelievable. i especially like merivel's "cure" for the crazies. they dance...and hey presto! everyone's happy and they're all better! i guess i just didn't like the character merivel too much. therefore, watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon into a great physician was grueling. also, i'm not entirely sure, but i didn't think the plague as well as the famous fire of london took place simultaneously.

mainly a biography of a lustful doctor, "robert merivel ," (robert downey) who has his way in the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half, mainly "katharine" (meg ryan).the good - fantastic set decoration (i.e. the lush king's palace) and costuming make this a visual treat. the language is also very tame. ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting support.the bad - after 50-60 minutes, this movie simply gets too boring. it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite: it drags on and on. the script certainly needed some badly-needed "restoration," shall we say? the film may look nice but it's a long two hours to sit through.....too long.

i have always liked bill murray in films like lost in translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. basically murray plays jack corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. he finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! the only way that jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. also starring pat hingle as vernon. there are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck's front bending forward, and murray screaming, but overall, it's pointless. pretty poor!

this *should* have been an amazingly funny movie...but it falls flat on its face. (in fact, i stopped watching it halfway through, which is something i rarely do...) -- bill murray plays jack corcoran, a second-rate motivational speaker who is bequeathed an elephant by his father (whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born) ; he then has one week to get the ponderous pachyderm across the country. his adventures on the way are only mildly amusing at best. janeane garofalo's considerable comedic talents go largely untapped. anita gillette is impressive in her small role as jack's mother (who has a lot of explaining to do), and pat hingle stands out as a former circus associate of jack's father. -- perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first, but i find that hard to believe...

before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. i didn't enjoy that film very much, but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashion.the actors don't shine, the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases. the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayle's intelligent jaggers.the so called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a great one. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what other people say, you are what you are, if others can't take it, **** 'em. pip was told this early on, but he didn't listen.the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story, not in that same horrible level, but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her. pip's childhood didn't appear much better. the ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story's style. the sets looked cheap, and coming to imdb i'm not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv-movie (which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library).live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so you wouldn't have to waste your time on this sort of movies.3/10

no,i'm not a radical feminst bashing the hentai and yaoi genre,i just find it really boring and pointless.my god,i was made to watch this for initiation from some stupid punk and my my,even an mst3k movie has a storyline,not to mention that this hentai crap is what's giving anime a bad name world-wide (watch out sailor moon!).sadly,people don't realize that not all anime(or any other asian style) is sleazy porn.death to the stereotype!!!*starts casting ultima*

oh, i'm mostly not the kind of person to give a movie less than 5 points. mostly, just because of the effort from actors and directors.3/10 for keyman from me. if anyone thinks the main character (or whoever) deserves an oscar, i deserve the nobelprize for peace.seriously. i can't believe this movie made it to europe. the acting was horrible, the plot was awful and what about the '70's horror-music. give me a break."popeye" eg. what about him? why is he there, he has nothing to do with the movie.and what about the keyman's talking. one time he can't say a decent word, the next time he's getting all talky-talk. he also nearly dies when he wakes up and some sunlight shines thru his bunker. but when he's walking down the street, the sunlight doesn't seem to do anything.watch this movie only of you're on the edge of dying of boredom. i regret myself for not watching my roses grow, which are in anyway more entertaining than this piece of...

slow, odd film that drags and plods (i mean really plods) along to its disappointing climax. you may expect some sort of punchline at the end, but there is none. both milland and snodgress give awkward performances; in fact, the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it. the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving....a gorilla. (**)

the attic starts off well. the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie snodgress' character buys a monkey. not one of those cute little monkeys. she buys a real big chimpanzee!!!this sudden plot device basically kills the movie. it's just not conceivable for a woman like the one snodgress plays, who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father, for her to, out of the blue, buy a chimpanzee. i mean, come on! forget about it!

linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, chuck traynor. i don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. we call ourselves "civilized" however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.

what can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd? nothing that would be positive. avoid this travesty at all costs. in any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa. i strongly suggest imdb to re-visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings, since an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! i am, by no means, a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's & 80's; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the (then illegal) stag loop.

antonio margheriti, director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror cannibal apocalypse, helms this gothic-flavoured giallo starring gap-toothed 70s icon jane birkin (as well as her massive-conked french lover of the day, serge gainsbourg).unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bi-sexual french teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, seven deaths in the cat's eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure.pretty schoolgirl corringa (birkin) returns to her family's scottish estate after many years away, only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one. using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways, dark corridors, creepy graveyards, candlelit cobweb covered rooms), margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings-on, but ends up with a lame cop-out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme.'and where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this?', i hear you ask. well, a rather pudgy moggy witnesses each murder thus justifying margheriti's rather cool sounding title.'gory, stylish fun' claims the dvd cover; 'boring pile of dung' says i.

not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so i guess they hit the spot. pretty dull for an adult though.hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? especially destiny. what about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?oh well, it will sell lego. kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. could have been a lot worse.

i saw grande ecole at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival. i had no idea what i was entering and if i'd had any idea i wouldn't have entered. this is the most pretentious film i've seen for a long time. it tries to be provocative, yet deep, with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes - it doesn't succeed! it's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen. 4/10

i saw this film at the new festival in new york. it was by far the worst film there. it's use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a wishy-washy script and direction that neither commits to a re-make of 'maurice' nor decides it's a neil labute flick, left me feeling 'why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this?'. it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment, which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't. i wish the director and editor had re-edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.

this film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake. it was not an "art" movie; just an excuse to show several gratuitous, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity. there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men. the camera zooms in on the men's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view. there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis. it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. i was wondering if i was watching a playgirl video by mistake. if these same scenes were filmed using women (ex: totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy...which is all that this film is. any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality. the themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing-desire, etc. were simple and superficial; no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student. just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead.

"grande ecole" is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but, if you're in need of it, a movie for an x-rated channel. although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer, the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. there's likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth, plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa. all that's missing is a female-to-female coupling, which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot.the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie -- but "grande ecole" is, to be blunt about it, no more than pornography with artistic aspirations. i'm not offended by the sex. it's just repetitive and, before long, boring. where's the hays office when you really need it?

this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater. look at the end of the picture, totally theatrical.with a reminiscent of les liaisons dangereuses the final steam-less speech try to make us think that the whole (and deep) theme of this matter was the manhood. who cares by this point? it was about manipulation. and so the audience feels after this movie has ended.young directors: a play is told with the words more than actions. a film is the opposite most of the times.and i'm not talking about the gay theme, overly exploited without a point ('cause there's no explanation of this topic considering the so called "philosophic" or presumptuous basis) to the level that this film should have been called grand gay

i saw this at a drive-in when i was 9. all i remember are a few scenes (the ones where the main character elle is being chased by a guy in a mask) and being scared spitless. seeing it now, my opinions have changed. it's a pathetic "horror" film about an ophanage run by gloria grahame (sad) and dealing with a young, talentless girl elle who is sent there after her mother, the town tramp, was beaten to death with a hammer (graphically shown). the film has adolescents (actually actors in their 20s) being beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with meat cleavers, raped etc etc. the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse. there is nothing to recommend about this crap. the plot is stupid, all the dialogue is bad and the acting...the less said the better. how did this sickie get by with a gp (now pg) rating? it would get an r now. worthless. one last thing...a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest!

... a recommendation! gloria grahame runs the kind of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call. that the orphanage is strapped for cash we know because gloria puts all the orphans to work, and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go round - especially for the older nubile female orphans (age range appears to be 12 - 30 ish). the new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a match for gloria - and has indeed just taken out her own mother & mother's lover (in a witty claw hammer and arson opening scene). predictably, gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. this one was made for about tuppence but was/is a huge huge huge hit on the grindhouse circuit. my dvd cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes", and it sure wasn't lying. i believe it is regarded as the citizen kane of orphanage set torture porn movies. 4/10

when the opening shot is u.s. marines seriously disrespecting the u.s. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. there is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired u.s. marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. the u.s. government is still finding the missing from wwii, and it takes months to identify the remains. military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. maybe this happens in denmark, but not in the u.s. clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the u.s. military.beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from cliffs notes. there's no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.

again, we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films. the good and the bad son story, courtesy east of eden. the american marine hero story, who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows. and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story.the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though. because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around. no luck this time though, as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same.as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father, so that conflict is never resolved properly. apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife. now, how satisfying is that.next, the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved. because he never really talks to the man under suspicion, namely his own brother. so once more we're handed a loose end here.and finally, the american military heroism hypocrisy theme, where the marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirtiness of war he went through, he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards, that third theme falls flat just the same. because the movie ends right when, for the first time, he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through. where the real story would actually begin at that very point, namely his process of recovery, how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to. all that, all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored.so while story wise this film is a serious, and i mean serious, disappointment, i'd still give it points for the impressive cast. although no film should use maguire for a voice over, because that belongs to spiderman. especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. so much that i'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.so while the cast really seems to do what they can, i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. a shallow and ultimately pretentious, utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. message du jour to the writers: we know the wounds already, see the host of vietnam films. you want to earn some credit, show us a believable healing.

maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan o'brien and late night's fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carson's show. carson daly can't hold a candle to leno, letterman, o'brien or any other late night talk show host, and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre. the shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short. but, i wouldn't call it crap. carson daly is sincere and doesn't hide the fact that his show isn't great(that honesty is actually helpful here), while some of last call's skits and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. actually, some of carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy.as an interviewer, carson is okay, even with only one guest, not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team. however, he doesn't have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious. i do not like his musical guests, but that's more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so, i'm not holding it against him.on to the house band. i don't know joe firstmans band and wouldn't compare them to the cbs orchestra, the tonite show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7. even cleeto and the cleetones are better. but, firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion. especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register), if anything, watch the show for him, i do.in summary, this show isn't even worth a full bag of kibble n' bits. but it does have an audience, and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". if you don't have cable and are up at 1:37 am, there really isn't much more to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is worse out there in that time frame. so, if you're waiting for poker after dark to come on, 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait.

for a while when i was in-between jobs i had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows. for a while i had a good selection: conan, leno, letterman, ferguson, kimmel...until i reached the 1:30 a.m. time slot. the time between conan and x- files, on scifi. and the only show on at that time was (and curiously still is) carson daly.his show intrigued me at first. youngish, casually dressed, and with the hip pedigree of an mtv host, i thought carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. i couldn't have been more wrong.he has no comedic timing. his jokes are plainly unfunny, and his monologue a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. i began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy (and i am right, he isn't), but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him. the writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad. and towards the end of the show being in-studio, the writers had carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show, an oblivious carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews.zero interview skills. none. he tries to be friendly/chatty, but ends up being boorish and rude. he talks too much. he cuts off his guests. he asks them rude or embarrassing questions -- if he can find a question to ask them at all. and as someone had already pointed out, the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable.now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam. even still, carson refuses to take the hint from nbc. at one point, carson didn't even get a camera man, he had to film himself for an episode! wake up, carson...that handwriting is all over the wall.i see the show is produced by carson. i can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air, he pays for it himself.

he seems to be a control freak. i have heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule-"no snakes." he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands. i watched the craig ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. he likes to bull sh** to burn time.i don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows.daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. he must do this at least 10 times a show. i do like the joe firstman band. carson daily needs to lighten up before it is too late.

before last call w/ carson daly, my local nbc affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w/ conan such as second city tv, 3rd rock from the sun & carline in the city reruns, and some stand up comedy. these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson daly and his awful show. he is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he isn't a good speaker nor comedian.on his june 21st show, he tried to use an internet meme called the "rickroll" on his show. he failed hard. that event confirms that carson daly is awful.

nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh, or even smile a little. i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years.even the "funny" band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him. daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys. it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny.awful awful awful show.it makes my soul cry.i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is. don't watch it. but if you absolutely have to, i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand.

carson daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian. what was nbc thinking! he's not funny! the writing is horrible to! all of the sketches are painful to watch. the current new karaoke isn't funny at all, especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it! the escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all. all he jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least clever, dumbest, not funny jokes ever put on television! i mean, anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with "because she's stupid," which cancels out any funniness that was in the joke, which was already very low. any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show. seriously, don't watch this show, unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.

i don't think i've ever gave something a 1/10 rating, but this one easily gets the denomination. i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes. it's not just that the jokes are so bad, but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma, can't set up or finish a punchline, and you've got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach.i have watched the show, never in its entirety, but many times still. it just creeps up on me after conan. i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever.actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that's screaming, "get me the hell away from this freak!" i do recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but to ponder, how he got on the air and what he's still doing there. watch as much as you can, i think you will find its complete awkwardness...interesting.

it's not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film. this was, however, simply the worst movie i have ever seen. the performances were laughable at best, at worst they were, well, there's no other word for it, awful. especially the lead female who's random sexual come-ons have to be seen and heard to be believed. honestly, the plot is nonsensical,the dialogue appalling and the characterisation...there is none. i'm surprised it's not an alan smithee film. i can't stress this strongly enough... avoid at all costs.how do movies like this ever get made? this is no budget film-making at its very, very worst.

jon good's wife (simply one of the worst titles for a film ever), or the red right hand (another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing & has no relevance to the film) under which i saw it, is set in 'salem, massachusettes 1978' (incidently the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days) where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion, gay-boy fagot roger mather (john kuntz, is that surname for real? just say it out loud...), martha alden (kim brockington), rebecca lawson (jenna stern) & her boyfriend jake stabler (john doe), alan hobbes (michael kevin walker) & his wife sandy (megan rawa) plus john good (marc ardito, why is the spelling of 'john' different in the title?) & his wife sara (abigail morgan). from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air & when someone mentions their 'missing' friend calef (jason winther) lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back. then comes the phone calls, the mysterious nose-bleeds, hallucinations & guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light...produced, executive produced & directed by kurt gioscia who also wrote the thing & kurt st. thomas who gets the art direction credit too & if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well! personally i thought jon good's wife was awful, i mean she can't cook or anything! ha ha ha, only joking! seriously though i didn't think much of the film overall, for a start it's pretty slow going & the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other & dull character building exposition. the film never explains itself, what's with those weird nose-bleeds for god's sake, the mysterious phone calls, the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural & what the hell was sara all about? she comes across as some nosey, sex crazed, dirty talking, shameless, bitter blackmailing know-it-all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets! some of the dialogue she spouts wouldn't be out of place in a porno & it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror/thriller it was supposedly meant to be. then there's the ending, if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it. the whole thing was very predictable as well, i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend calef went 'missing' there wouldn't be more to it?directors gioscia & thomas make an infuriating film, on top of the predictability & annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by alan which i simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else & at what point in time is he narrating from? the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon. there's no tension because the whole things so by-the-numbers.technically the film is ok but nothing special & some of the locations & clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me, this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's. the acting was alright & what about actor john kuntz last name? i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of kuntz, right?!i really didn't think much of jon good's wife (a blow up doll would have been better! ha ha ha) & i'm not sure who it would appeal to. forget about any gore, horror, violence, scares, atmosphere or excitement, in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here. not recommended.

i'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store, wondering if i should give it a shot. today i broke down and gave it a whirl, and i probably shouldn't have.while the writer/director did give the film a respectable effort, it fell far short of engaging. the characters, while you wanted to feel for them, just didn't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them. sara's sexual outbursts got tiring-- fast. i don't mind sex in films, and i don't mind bitchy characters, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean you're prone to excitedly ask people at random if they'd like sexual favors. by the time what happened to the characters was revealed, i was bored, and ready to fast-forward to the climax, the end, anything exciting... and nothing delivered. the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic, and just wasn't played quite right. if they'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there, i might have been interested. this should have been a more of a suspense/drama film, and should have stuck to the title "jon good's wife" rather than the whole "red right hand" and horror film-like cover. hell... this should have had suspense, period.either way... watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on the television. though this isn't as great as i'd hoped, i would go for this over some infomercials.

sorry i couldn't be more expressive in my summary, but those two words seemed to describe the movie perfectly. this is not only a bad film, but a bad film with bad acting and a plot that will be inconsequential to most watchers.see it only for a naked rebecca de mornay tied to a chain-link fence and moaning with 'ecstasy; supposedly 'erotic', but actually hilarious.

rebecca de mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play,if you cannot say something nice...de mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink.she has an affair with banderas ,whom we suspect of being (ouch!how original!) a serial killer.sometimes she recalls banderas's mother-in-law tippi hedren's character in "marnie" .but i wouldn't count on it:hitchcock died twenty-four years ago ,and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him .here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end,but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it.the movie includes the obligatory "conversations with a serial killer" in the "silence of the lamb" tradition,murders (human beings and cats),split personality,and open ending in case the crowds should call for more.apparently they did not,and they were right.

man, is this lousy. it doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so, keeping it brief, rebecca demornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio banderas in a wine store, he of the ponytail and jail-house tats. when she cuts loose, she really cuts loose. other than this torrid affair she's having (and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps) she's a pretty cold fish. her broke, ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out. she's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor (dennis miller) at bay. and there's prisoner harry dean stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed.all these people, and perhaps more, are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her. somebody sends her dead flowers. somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat. (the next time i see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot, i'm going to puke.) so who's doing it? guess. no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending, but maybe a hint will help: childhood abuse.the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself, far more interesting than the movie. what does "childhood abuse" mean? do we mean sexual abuse? physical? both? how about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon, hard enough to break it? that's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. sexual abuse? that never happened to any of us, as far as i know, although i'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. in the samoan village i studied for two years, there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. the girl's family beat hell out of him. the boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (by the way, the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember dad's night-time visits in any case since long-term memory isn't really established until about that time.) demornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called "the social construction of trauma." it's not there unless we put it there. enough of the psychiatric lecture. that will be fifteen cents.you want trauma? i'll give you trauma. the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca demornay's character, right from the beginning. then, when she has her first tryst with antonio banderas, and pio donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads, the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. now that's traumatic. it makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the california men's colony in san luis obispo. don't get me wrong. i don't dislike antonio banderas. it's just that i'm not in love with him. there aren't enough nude shots of rebecca demornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.here's an engaging way of surviving this movie. instead of just sitting there puling, try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and separating them from the ones shot in budapest. it's a challenge, really, and may, for all we know, preserve your sanity.

this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen. it's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending. i watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad. the movie starred two actors that i like very much, rebecca demornay and antonio banderas. sure they had decent chemistry together but for what? the movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.miss demornay plays sarah taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder. that pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. this being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.mr. banderas plays a mystery man named tony ramirez, who comes into sarah's life. the whole first meeting and first encounter between tony and sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot. and there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here. one thing that i would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot. anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives, weird packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill sarah, incident that say things aren't normal anymore. overall the movie was badly conceived, the editing at times seem jumpy, and the conclusion was laughable. another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole orchestral music playing in the background. a more subtle musical score would have been better. i have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, miss demornay was very good in that sequence. it's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career. she's that rare combination of talent and beauty.

to judge a movie just for the landscapes,decor,costumes....it is just not right , you are missing the core : the storya movie has to narrate something , to tell a story something that impress you . yes , i was pleased by the sea , cliffs , clear water and all that but ... there is the plot ?they are more interesting movies with mad people , such as : flight over the cuckoo"s nest...etc...etc. this one is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband. just a clear psychiatric case !!!! nothing extraordinary.unfortunately a waste of time . and there is all that rage coming from ? fish smell ? sea ?

this could have been a breakout role for valeria golino but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area. the film is about a woman named grazia (golino) who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three. she is a free spirit and prone to outbursts so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to milan and see a doctor. the story takes place on the island of lampedusa off of sicily and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rivaling gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock. grazia's oldest son pasquale (francesco casisa) adores her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression. the daughter marinella (veronica d'agostino) is a blossoming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman and the youngest son filippo (filippo pucillo) is very sassy and mocks the policeman's accent. upon learning that she is to be sent to milan, grazia runs away and pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her. this film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to grazia. we do see some outbursts and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes. nothing comes of it. the film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director emanuele crialese credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial. the film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up. their is some speculation that golino's character gives a hint of being a mermaid like creature and that is why she is having difficulty existing on land. i also sense that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain manner and if you don't then you can be subjected to the harsh realities of its rules. all speculations but i do think the films attention could have stayed with the character of grazia. after she hides in the cave she really has nothing to do. in a sense, the character becomes stagnant. i wish golino had more to do because i've always liked her and whenever she is onscreen you just can't take your eyes off her. she's a bundle of fury, passion and raw energy! what a shame crialese didn't write a more complete role for her to act in. when the film ends your left feeling empty from an incomplete story.

i'm sorry folks, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "respiro" are very strange, to say the least. is craziness picturesque, i ask and didn't find an answer. of course, the movie is beautifully filmed, at part it's almost a documentary. but then, the fact is that when it comes to the women grazia, she shows every sign of a deep illness and i was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has. her behavior is absolutely worrisome and the (shocked) citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition. she needs treatment, urgently! behaviour like hers is inferno to everybody around her, her husband, the poor children (especially) and the fellow citizens. let's not be falsely romantic about this! i hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill. why, for god's sake, should the husband not want to have her cured or at least try to do this? why the horror of going to milan (a big city, sure, but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her)? narrowmindedness? irresponsibility? anyway, i inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on dvd and after seeing it i had to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it. frankly, i understand why the movie did not get any further as an indication to the cannes selection...

a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie. valeria golino's character grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. the other characters are thin, probably the writer's fault not the actors'. the only exception is filippo pucillo as the younger son filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing.i suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town, but for me, the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way, for example, when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.

the synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. i like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of "chocolat" with a less fairy tale and more bite. what i got was a cast of despicable characters.for a character-driven movie to be effective, i need to feel a connection or compassion for the people. there was no one with whom i could relate in the movie. grazia (golino, whose work i admired in "rain man") portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar, female that is often rude, aggressive and violent. her husband bickers and yells, when he is not hitting or slapping someone. the children are rude brats. they yell at each other and the females in the movie. they attack other children with no provocation. violence begets violence. this seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and rude people all the way around.the direction is not compelling. there are intermixed scenes that attempt to be art, but instead bore the viewer. the location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film.i would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.

... i am left with little choice but to employ it at least once during the course of my review of respiro. among other things, what defines pretension is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the author's part. respiro seems made with an all too contrived and self-aware intent to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical... mythical, even. but luckily for all true artists out there, a predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth doesn't exist. stunning natural locations (yes, these remote parts of southern italy look exotic even to most other italians), pretty actors and some amusing, gutsy, spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't elevate a substanceless movie beyond a pretty succession of images. yet this insincere and vain, and ultimately hollow movie aches to be art, succeeding only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by accident. i'll admit that the conceptually pompous ending does have a certain visual poetry to it. however, it's my belief that this was achieved in ways that had more to do with the beauty of the lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (connecting it to so much that's mythical, mystical, religious, archetypical, etc) than with crialese's talent.valeria golino is gratingly histrionic and affected in her performance as grazia. for a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background, she sure has a fashionable wardrobe. her flattering, floaty floral dresses and attractive, sun-kissed beach hair could have graced the pages of any vogue summer edition. the fact she was a "nutcase" could in a way have been nothing but a fashionable addition to her trendy demeanour and look - that's how skin-deep her "condition" seemed to me. golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural child-woman misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tiresome and irritating at worse, while leaving me unmoved and indifferent at best. i agree with the reviewer from london who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema - during the course of the entire movie we never really get a sense of grazia's illness and have no idea what is actually wrong with her (other than her being a tiresome stereotype of a "free spirit"). we don't know why she's given injections and is required to see a specialist in milan. this generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main tell-tale signs of the movie's overall shallowness.another fairly insulting aspect of respiro is the quaintification of its location. i struggled to figure out whether this movie was supposed to be set in the present day or the past, seeing as it aimed to make even an admittedly backward part of italy (by comparison) seem a dozen times quainter and more conveniently primitive than it actually is. again, this smacks of shallowness and a complete lack of sincerity on crialese's part. some non-italian viewers will gleefully lap up the picturesque backwardness, the cliché of the possessive, macho italian man as if it were common-place, so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one culturally stranded sometime in the 1950s (the question i'd like to ask david ferguson, the reviewer from dallas, texas is as follows: is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? no? ok, then why should mine be?). unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view italy in such an anachronistic way, that aspect of respiro is actually ridiculous and phoney even in the eyes of this italian viewer. the subtly incestuous tension between grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as fabrizio bentivoglio's sexist-but-loving-husband routine. i especially loathed the scene in which grazia joins her husband and male friend in some man-to-man banter over a bottle of beer, to her husband's macho embarrassment and displeasure. according to this movie, it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations. ah, but our "loveable" "free-spirit" is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of lampedusan patriarchy! not only does this scene depict something so fake, it should be enough on its own to discredit the entire movie's credibility. it also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it strives to depict, clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. i would challenge anyone who knows contemporary italy to say otherwise.for a truly accomplished contemporary italian filmmaker, one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the greats of italy's glorious cinematic past (which alas, isn't the shadow of its former self!), look no further than gianni amelio - especially lamerica, così ridevano and his latest, la stella che non c'è. unlike most contemporary italian cinema, sadly derivative and stagnant, amelio's is a fresh and independently creative voice. despite my scathing review of respiro, i am now more than willing to believe that crialese's latest nuovomondo, now showing in italian cinemas, will be a worthwhile one. i therefore look forwards to enjoying it, though it won't be overly shocking to me if i don't (considering my feelings for respiro!).

i'm surprised over the number of folks that have rated this entry as their favorite "chan" (didn't they ever see "...at the opera" or "...at treasure island?"--- the latter ironically written by john larkin, who dropped the ball here). this plot is a train wreck and overloaded with pointless characters. first, viewers are required to recall the sordid details of steve mcbirney's (played by venerable thug and huac squealer marc lawrence) 1929's murder spree. let's not forget he escaped a capital murder rap at the courthouse with a lone policeman on his tail. there's also a victim that was fished out of a river 11 years earlier that no one ever seems concerned about. then there's the suspension of disbelief required when all the characters are seemingly trapped in the wax museum (although inspector o'matthews manages to wield his fat wet rear end inside through a window). why is joan valerie (as cream's assistant) in this movie? she can't even handle pliers properly--- i realize chan suffers the same boo-boo but yeesh, he's 66 years old here-- (and has less than 10 lines--- and her character's motivation is too weak to ever be adequately 'splained (excuse me, when i'm on a rant i write like ricky ricardo). the mary bolton (marguerite chapman) character is written to as a eager wide-eyed moron, apparently existing only for the vapid romantic interest of horndog lawyer tom agnew (played by the ferret-faced ted osborne). why is willie fern a character? why couldn't mcbirney's henchman pulled the switch at 8:20? (not a spoiler, okay?!). one wonders how, with the iq of lint he manages to dress himself or why he hadn't stepped in front of a bus years ago. toler himself is given a little more acting rope than usual (a plus) and the real kudos go to set designer thomas little and cinematographer virgil miller who created some genuinely spooky atmosphere... but this entry has less logic than a ritz brothers film. i'm still boggled by how a toothpick can be used as a blow gun.

sayles had a very interesting film on his hands with silver city, however it somehow became very muddied as it progressed from beginning to end. chris cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character, a dubya of sorts, but he wasn't nearly given enough screen time. instead, we find ourselves on a rampage with a character that felt less personal, less developed, and overall too confusing. the path that this danny huston leads us on inevitably becomes the downfall of the film. too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. these characters randomly were involved with the progression of the plot, which became too convoluted with each passing minute. sayles knew what he was creating, i just feel as if it wasn't being translated well to the silver screen.sayles is a master of his trade. his films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes. the trouble with silver city is that i think he found himself going too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all. at the beginning of the film, i had an idea of what was happening, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plot twists tried to occur i lost the sense of the film by the ending. while the ending was very clever and very dark, i needed more explanation. i think some of the reason that i lost my train of thought with this film was due to the casting of danny huston as our guide. he was pathetic. i didn't seem him as very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. he seemed to go through the motions, but not really accomplish much at all. this was the first downfall of sayles' important film.while i will admit that the characters played by richard dreyfuss, miguel ferrer, james gammon, and daryl hannah were interesting, i just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. danny huston just did not cut it for me. outside of the characters, sayles needed a stronger script. i sometimes felt that unless i was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were well over my head. the entire reasoning for silver city to be built and the corruption behind it eluded me. i am a simpleton that loves advanced films, but this one just didn't make much sense to me. there were several times that i found myself asking, "why" instead of seeing the whole picture. i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass, yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time. sayles needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues, which ultimately fogged this film.perhaps i went into this film with the wrong idea. i was expecting to see another version of primary colors, but instead witnessed something less heartfelt and more technical. without giving the ending away, i thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history. the brilliant symbolism has stayed in my mind for the past two days after watching this film, while the rest of the movie quickly shuffled away from my mind. maybe a second viewing would do better for me, but for some odd reason silver city just didn't click with me. there seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or accounted for. an ensemble piece is always good with me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, it just looses steam. this was one of those rare occasions.overall, i was very upset with this film. being very democrat, i wanted to see a side of politics that i wasn't aware of and another side that would make you chuckle. i wanted to be engulfed with the world of corporate money and the dufus' that are elected. i wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of george w., but instead all i found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience of which i will never be a part. sad, this picture had so much wasted promise.grade: ** out of *****

silver city (2+ outta 5 stars) as a huge fan of john sayles' work for many years now i feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done. that said, the movie isn't exactly *terrible*... just very uninspired. sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the selling out of youthful ideals) but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way. even the dialogue (usually sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time around.. sounding clichéd and forced in almost every scene. the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didn't make it past its third episode. there are tons of big stars on hand... and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive... but the material just isn't there this time around. while filming a campaign spot a governor-hopeful (a poor and obvious george w bush stand-in) fishes a dead body out of a lake. an investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate... but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker (and more clichéd) secrets to be discovered. sayles has made similarly-themed movies so much better in the past ("lone star", "matewan", "return of the secaucus seven", "men with guns"). it's a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water. one good line, delivered by richard dreyfuss: "danny, you're a loser. that's already been established beyond doubt. so just try and be a good one, okay?"

this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far-left. i consider my self a moderate, so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was. while i'm not a bush fan, your dislike for gw is not enough of a reason to see this movie.to start, the movie was shot on such low-grade film that it comes off as cheap, rather then artsy. additionally, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. chris cooper's character was a poor parody of george bush; better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film. the rest of the characters are walking clichés and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better movies.avoid this movie at all costs!

apparently the film has a harsh anti-bush message... if it does (i didn't get it), that's all it is. it's boring and useless, period.it's too serious at times to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not gripping, not exciting, not film. it's too everything to be the opposite, and vise versa. i was amazed at how bad a film could suck. don't even think of watching it.i have watched literally hundreds of films, and never have i been so obliged to write a warning on imdb. avoid at all costs. you have been warned.even "the making of..." is painfully boring. it's just people talking gibberish with loads of inside jokes infront of a camera, sort of like a home movie. there even is a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew. still, beats the movie i guess...

honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies i have ever seen. seemed like a made-for-tv movie. and a bad one at that. i cannot believe that people are still hiring danny huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing john sayles to make films. my husband and i came across this movie on tv one night and got so bored with it, we ended up cleaning the house while it was on . . . and it still bored us! it made me think that critics have been so gullible with sayles' previous films, such as lone star, which was raved about at he time but didn't really add up to much in the end. spend your time on something better. anything.

generally political messages are done on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness, watch to your hearts content. most people go to the movies to be entertained, not sold some poppycock political nonsense. the hook here is the big name cast. unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere. the two best performances, chris cooper, and richard dreyfus, have minimal screen time. in short, "silver city" is to be avoided as entertainment. it is nothing more than a non documentary, rambling political expose on illegal immigration, pollution, and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen. - merk

i don't really consider myself a conservative, so i wasn't personally offended by this film, but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message. and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). the characters are one-dimensional -- either good, freedom-loving americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. there's nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. i don't really mind the political bias itself, but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the movie. and clearly it is.on the positive side, the cast is wonderful and chris cooper's impression of w is funny the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke being told over and over again.so if you really hate the conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this film, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that's less black-and-white, then you'd be better off watching something else.

when a bbc murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer must be: the homosexual.who murdered the sexy blonde teenager (who's also a pathological liar) on her way home from school? let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serial-killer father behind bars? could it be the moody son, who's impressed by his dad's no-nonsense attitude about women? could it be the serial killer himself, who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars, a la hannibal lecter? could it be mom's boyfriend, a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex-student led to his wife's suicide? or could it be boyfriend's daughter, who goes blabbing everyone's secrets at school, causing untold misery? no, it's none of these likely suspects. it's...the homosexual!the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is. of course, it could be anybody, since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the "normal" folks. the homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together, and things can return to normal...whatever that is.as for the cast, both jemma redgrave and robson green are now officially past their sell-by dates. the world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again, but as long as the bbc has roles for the aggrieved woman and the misunderstood man, i suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one.

this film is a perfect example of how to take a fascinating subject, come up with 25 minutes of substantive material and stretch it into a six hour borefest resembling the shape a documentary might take if fox news decided to make one. even the participants in this obnoxiously obstreperous film can't conceal their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where people take a stand and work to make a better world. if only the creators had spoken with ken burns for 5 minutes, they might have come out with something mildly intelligent instead of this cure for insomnia.

it's difficult to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit, to be honest. the shoddy animation doesn't help, as it makes this look like a decades-old video you'd find in morrisons's 99p bin. still, it's better than the abysmal screenplay, which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like belle's present day problems, stuff about scrooge's dad, and plenty of charmless fannying around with - choke - two anthropomorphic mice. these bizarre additions eat up screen time at the expense of elements you'd think would be quite important, like dickens's dialogue and key chunks of his plot - the movie buggers up the game of twenty questions, for example, and at times fails to put scenes in the right order. absolutely hopeless.

this was only the second version of the classic story by charles dickens i had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. the film opens with a quick live action piece where simon callow as charles dickens begins the story of a christmas carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. you probably already know it, ebenezer scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates christmas. he is visited by jacob marley (nicolas cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of christmas past (jane horrocks), present (sir michael gambon) and the silent future/yet to come. after all this he obviously realises the true magic of christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. the only changes i noticed to the story were scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), scrooge's ex-love belle (kate winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the ghost of christmas present showing the two kids, "want" and "ignorance", scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and he's worried he can't keep his promise to stay nice. also starring rhys ifans as bob cratchit, juliet stevenson as mrs. cratchit, iain jones as scrooge's nephew fred and colin mcfarlane as fezziwig. the animation is not great quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. the only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of kate winslet, singing the closing song "what if", as for the rest, it is just excruciatingly awful. very poor!

i once had a conversation with my parents who told me british cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a film's country of origin before going to see it . it didn't matter what the plot was or who was in it , if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldn't want to see it . this might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing the astonished heart i can understand why people in those days preferred american cinema to the home grown variety back in the 1940s british equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie . everyone speaks in an english lad dee daa upper class accent that makes the british royal family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential british audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching jimmy cagney in white heat because people would have , if not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class english shrink in 1949 . that's entertainment , the reason people go to cinemas . even the characters names seem bizarre - leonora ! how many british people were named leonora in 1949 ? and the protagonists drink cocktails . and they use words like " austere " . you do get the feeling that this wasn't marketed for a 1949 mainstream british audience . but why should it if the majority of british cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining american imports ? watching the atsonished heart in 2005 i was astonished how dated everything was , in fact it's so dated i thought maybe it might be a spoof from the harry endfield show . what didn't astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the british film industry , an industry that didn't pick up until american money invested in crowd pleasers like zulu , alfie and the james bond movies

i like noel coward, the wit. i like noel coward, the play write. i like noel coward, the composer and singer, but i loathe noel coward the actor.to me this is a man who should have stayed firmly behind the scenes, writing his plays and composing his music and making his profound and hilarious observations. he should never have been allowed in front of a camera.make no mistake, he is one of the top outstanding talents of the 20th century but the man just couldn't act, and his voice...with it's rolling r's and it's overly round tonal quality...well it could quite easily grate cheese in my opinion.this is one of my least favourite offerings from coward, as he unconvincingly portrays a psychiatrist embarking on an affair with a much younger woman, made worse by the fact that the much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wife.celia johnson is as much a joy to watch as ever as cowards wronged wife. it is her performance that saves this film from abject dullness. i suppose her own little fling in coward's brief encounter four years previously qualified her for this role as she must have raised a few eyebrows playing a such a promiscuous woman and this gave her the chance to win back a few fans and gain some lost sympathy.she was such a wonderful actress and you can see why noel coward used her so much in many of his productions.however the rest of the film is drab, badly acted, predictable and on the whole boring to almost arse-clenching level.if its noel coward you want then take the time to watch in which we serve, blythe spirit or this happy breed instead. three noel coward treasures. with lovely films like these i suppose we can forgive him for this turkey.i have given this four stars purely for the addition of miss johnson, but on the whole i'd avoid this one like the plague.

the title is from a passage in the bible (deut. 28:28). let's just say it is taken horribly out of context - but nonetheless, that is where the title of this agonizing movie originates. the other reviewers cover the plot details so i wont rehash. but the husband, who is a psychiatrist, delivers a lecture on "inferior function" where he discusses how a person can meet another another person and they can experience a "cataclysmic crisis" in their lives where they cease to be masters of themselves and incapable of fair judgement. he is saying this at the podium at the exact moment as he lays eyes on leonora vail in the audience - the woman who will become his mistress. not very subtle for showing that this is indeed what will happen to this poor man.i think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and just didn't work. here is an over-the-hill psychiatrist, and we are to believe this young, beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the happiness he and his wife shared. what's even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she learns of the infidelity. not only is she understanding, but she insists her husband embark on a several month vacation with the tramp - "so we all can get a little relief from this unbearable stress". give me a break!! i wanted to reach through the screen and throttle not just the adulterer but the dim-wit wife.the fact that the whole movie takes place as a flashback after already revealing the end of the movie at the beginning (the fact that the husband had a terrible accident) - it leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the sordid affair. i think this was a poor decision as it leaves absolutely no plot twists to look forward to, as the whole movie is completely predictable. you already know the wife's resignation to the affair at the beginning of the film as she summons the mistress to the dying man's bedside and expresses no ill will towards her.not only is the script defective, but noel coward is horribly miscast (even though it is his screenplay). he and leonora have absolutely no chemistry on screen whatsoever. its interesting that michael redgrave was originally cast in that role, but was replaced during filming. i wonder what that was about? in the end, neither the husband or the wife cause you to feel any sympathy for either one of them. i do think margaret leighton played the part of strumpet quite well. but she couldn't possibly overcome all the negatives this film had. also, as is the case of many british productions of this era, the dialogue is hard to understand due to the clipped, fast speech pattern of the actors. i saw it on tv and couldn't even rely on closed captioning to fill in the blanks for me.don't waste your time on this one.

this appears to be one of noel coward's lesser known films, and it is easy to understand why. taken at face value it's not a bad film, but there's nothing terribly good about it either. nothing much happens at all throughout the course of the film, it's simply the story of chris and leonora's ill-fated affair, and barbara's reaction to it. the only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know it's going to end badly for one reason or another, owing to the first scene. oddly, there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict, and yet none of them are utilised. for example, it would've been much more interesting and believable if barbara had've fallen out with leonora, but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film. the notion of barbara having been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all - in fact she didn't even seem to feel betrayed by her husband; she even encourages him to go on a holiday with leonora. similarly, chris' two secretaries at his practice, susan birch and tim verney, who also happen to be close friends of both chris and barbara, are never forced to take sides. in fact, tim shies away from conflict by telling chris that he's terribly fond of both him and barbara. despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we don't care whether chris ends up with leonora or barbara. the two womens' personalities are indistinguishable anyway so we don't know which of the two is better suited to be with chris, and besides this, barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she hardly cares about the affair anyway. furthermore, i found chris and leonora's relationship somewhat unconvincing. i can overlook the ridiculously short timeframe in which they fall for each other because that is so common in films of this era, but even then the relationship seemed shallow. coward's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of leonora's affections. he reminds me of the socially inept genius sir earnest pease from the film "very important person" - i'm sure the two would've gotten along well. chris' coldness and austerity made his love for leonora seem insincere. i think coward should've sat this one out and given his part to a younger man - as it is, i was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a sombre, mostly emotionless, balding middle aged man. despite all my criticisms, the film still manages to be interesting - just not terribly compelling. the fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature, which is somewhat intriguing. the astonished heart is certainly worth watching, but it is a flawed piece of cinema.

do the writers that conjure up these type of "comedies" have such empty lives that they have to embody them in tragic shows like this?.why the talented and gorgeous busy phillips is amongst this trash is beyond me,i cannot stand the hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as is the other african-american girl with the shrill voice.the jokes are often stupid, the jewish guy yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere, one particular episode with the solider looking for love was just terrible.i don't believe there would be that many working in a looking for love office and only one man? of course all of the woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent.i actually found holly funny in her older shows and i have always admired busy but this show is dumb, empty and had nothing going for it.

"marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent ambient sounds, and good scenery. unfortunately, the movie, aside from these aspects, falls flat on its face. for a woman trying to complete so many crossword puzzles in a day, she spends an awful lot of time standing around, sulking, and not doing puzzles. i believe there is more walking shown in the movie than her work on these puzzles. also, while i understand the point of showing so much scenery, there is simply far too much of it. the movie is incredibly boring and unfocused. it's not worth buying, renting, watching on television, or viewing in any conceivable way. i lost interest so quickly that i'm not sure why i sat through the entire film in the first place.

think of the most un-film-worthy subject you can and this is 10 times worse. a woman needs to complete as many crosswords as she can in a day. we don't even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own, we just watch her struggle. the woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crosswords, but for some reason she spends the time distractedly walking all around the city when she could be focused at home. the acting is horrible, the actress huffs and puffs as she tried to think of the words, and we are left completely in the dark. the new york scenery is nice but the movie relies on it too much and it gets old fast. the movie plays like a rejected nyu student film. this film has no redeeming qualities and i do not recommend it to anyone, ever.

the "film" consists of the audition tapes of the "surrender girls" and some footage from previous films. it's not hot or even suitable for late night viewing on cinemax. only an adolescent boy could be interested in auditions from beyond. i recommend avoiding this one.

i saw the preview in femalien and thought it could be a cool film. turns out, it is an awful garbage. there isn't much nudity in the film, not to mention not having much sex either. there were just some dumb and corny dialogues along with some noninteresting dancing you usually expect to see during audition. in our case, you may even see it in the actual films. conclusion: i ain't got none for it. just leave it alone.

surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic, almost explicit sci-fi films. while they generally do very well at these (femalien 1 & 2, virtual encounters), this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape. any number of girls -- some recognizable and others not -- are in this film in all stages of nudity. there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding, unless you've seen those other films. there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things -- some playing basketball, others talking, still others playing with themselves. the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene -- a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and a more subdued tammie hainum. not highly recommended.

oddly, i have very little to say about "the box" so this will be pretty brief. i have never read the richard matheson novella "button, button" from which the film is based, but considering what i saw in this "adaptation", there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work. "the box" is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it. frank langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere... ??spoiler?? they push it ??end of spoilers?? that whole concept was interesting on its own, but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message. while i'm trying to be as 'fair' as possible, i still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely. i guess its from the same director as "donnie darko" which i remember liking when i saw it years ago. "the box" would've worked well as a short film, but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way, i can't come close to recommending it...

this is a flic that you can safely avoid. childish plot and poor acting from cameron (she really shouldn't take on these serious roles - they don't suit her)besides she looks most unglamorous, lets face it, shes' great in charlies angels and she was superb in there's something about mary... the pope wouldn't be a good president of the usa and vice versa, my point being that there are some actors/actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and cameron is most unsuited for this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actress' would have done a far better job. the movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot (did i spell juvinile right??) i noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given the box a 10 rating, who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell. i mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review? does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't? c'mon 'professor.

the box is a film with great potential, but the makers totally misused that potential. the film seemed to take for ever, because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action. those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. the philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of thomas hobbes (1588-1679), but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds, were even harry potter would flunked his class with!probably the best part was that moment when norma lewis (cameron diaz)has been shot to death, by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. i wonder how hobbes would react if he could...

how truly sad that this sprung from the same mind as donnie darko, possibly one of the best films in this genre. where do i even begin? i think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity, and yet we see no humanity in the film. no more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human. these are horrible one dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings. sadly, that's how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting. is this truly how kelly sees humanity? judging from the reaction of viewers, this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity. why don't the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have? this is not an indictment of humanity. it's an indictment of the straw men that kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situation.to those who say this was a wonderful thought-provoking film, to what are you comparing it? armageddon? i even saw someone compare this to the works of kurosawa. how truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion? for the love of all that's good in film! even indecent proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is. there we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition. yes, even indecent proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this mindless tripe.rarely have i seen a more pretentious, pontificating, and self aggrandizing, film fall so flatly on its face. this has the depth of a high school film project, and a poor one at that. truly, that's about the level of the discussion promoted by this film. if you want to see good psychological film making, do yourself a favor and check out das experiment. if the box had lived up even to this one goal, i would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting, gaping plot holes, and sheer nonsensical storyline. sadly, it can't even do that.the true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition. this is not sartre! this is not even the cliff notes version of sartre! this is a hastily conceived and hack-written 9th grade term paper on sartre based on some internet message board ramblings. if sartre were alive, he would sue kelly for defamation.

first of all. should cameron diaz ever be allowed to act again? to call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances. that was a historically horrific performance. any small chance that diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that. laughably horrible.two, the movie was extremely boring, and not very thought provoking at all. i can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors, play out a terrible story.third, there was not a single likable character, and even worse, it seemed like that was done by design. you were not supposed to like, or feel sympathy for any character. it was quite effective. i wanted them all to just die to be honest. aliens included. kid included. everyone was just one big mope in this movie. everyone literally just moped around, and they called it a movie. you could barely distinguish the zombie "employees," with regular people, because they all seemed like zombies.lastly, nothing really makes sense. from the characters reactions and emotions, to the literal story line, it all just seems random. this is just a really bad movie, disguised and couched as a "thinking mans movie," which is meant to be confusing. give me a break. a bad movie is a bad movie. and this movie was bad.

"don't be greedy" sums up the depth of this movie. all the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing. the movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. none of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess.the charm of dd, as others have pointed out, was in the schizophrenia device,the humor woven into the fabric of the movie, and most importantly, the acting. there is enough wooden acting in the box to attract a giant mound of martian termites.the biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question, "why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all?" awful failure of a movie.

i came across this film by accident and wish i hadn't.why make a sexually rude sequel (and some gore when a man is beheaded) of a well know children's movie.do not take young kids to see this the title misdirects you, it has nothing to do with the original snow white except for stealing it's characters. better still don't bother going yourself, it's not worth it.i could not watch it all, the poor (in comparison to disney) cartoon graphics, and no plot except on how to totally mess up a classic movie made me want to give up and leave.

c'était complètement minable : à fuir absolument! this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material, and thoroughly succeeded!do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros torn up and shoved up your nostrils by a bunch of vapid, atrociously unamusing characters.this type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences. if the individual (heaven forbid a collective could have conceived this dross) behind this had been considerate enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas, he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure, and mercifully rewritten it or just scrapped it altogether. the vein of adult humour being mined here dates, to my mind, back to fritz the cat but lacks that film's avant-garde status or even its base attempt at social commentary.with the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on pre-existing source material to fund storytelling these days, one would hope that choosing snow white, and thus not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story, would have allowed more time for, oh i don't know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesn't telegraph its vacuity from the opening frame? a manifestly appalling production.

to some of us, director ernst lubitsch, adored for his underlying cheekiness and ironic comic touches, was rather wet when it came to picking material. it isn't that lubitsch is overrated--on the contrary, he probably was ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative--yet the projects he became attached to (or was assigned to) are not quite the landmarks of comedy his fans like to label them. with "heaven can wait", a screen-adaptation of lazlo bus-fekete's play "birthday", lubitsch is saddled with sleepy don ameche in the lead--and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star, and a musty flashback-framework stymies the director. a wicked man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without realizing it", presenting the facts of his life in front of hell's entrance. ameche...wicked? that was problem number one. the promising opening sequence (set in the hades lobby) quickly gives way to dreary whimsy, and the supporting cast is of little help. *1/2 from ****

henry (don ameche) turns up at the entrance to hell and recounts his life story to his excellency (laird cregar). the story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life, and in particular, his relationship with martha (gene tierney). at the end of the film, we cut back to henry and his excellency for a very predictable ending.unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens. its a sentimental story of one man's life and its very boring. i watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish, despite the lubitsch touch. i yawned more than 15 times. hugo (charles coburn) is good whenever he is on screen as the grandfather and there were a few funny moments of dialogue. the colour made it a good spectacle but it wasn't enough to save this plodder from going into the reject pile. in the same mould as "its a wonderful world" and "you can't take it with you", and so, not surprisingly, it was nominated for an oscar. a story about ordinary people, none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest. boring, sentimental and the biggest damp squib of an ending that i can remember...

"heaven can wait" is a crushing bore and a candy-coated, misogynist lie. i can't imagine anyone but film students sitting through it today. don ameche is in almost every scene, and, while he has a mellifluous voice that no doubt contributed to his successful career in radio, he doesn't have the charisma to carry this film. ameche plays henry, a womanizer. lubitsch wants to make henry's sexual incontinence adorable and amusing, and so he directs ameche to play the part as blandly as possible. the combination of ameche's lack of charisma and lubitsch's insistence on blandness results in a lead character who is both deadly dull and completely icky. you wouldn't want to spend any time with this man; he'd put you to sleep. you wouldn't leave him alone with your daughter, no matter her age. something creepy would happen.the movie's look is quite boring. scene after scene consists of static, overly lighted, diorama-style shots of fastidiously dressed gilded age stuffed shirts and bustles lounging in excessively busy, victorian parlors. there's so many ruffles and frills and curlicues, so much lilac and sky blue and pink, you need dramamine.this movie hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it presents that hatred with a candy coating and a sweet little bow on top. the contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is sickening. in one of the movie's most hateful scenes, an elderly woman is sent to hell because she's not physically attractive.

cameron diaz, james marsden, frank langella: that's an all-star power cast but "the box" proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie. the premise sounds promising: a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar. the downside is that someone will die, a person they probably will not know. so what do you do ? this gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. after that, the story derails completely. vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the nasa, nothing really is explained here. "the box" is a disappointment, could have been so much better. but since it is based on an ultra short story, that explains the continuity errors.

while there is a lot to recommend about maetel legend both in concept and finished product, it's ultimately a poor film. plot wise it's a retelling of maetel's early life, which is usually unclear; at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire. and since leiji matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for emeraldas her sister, her mother: the queen of la metalle and a bit of galaxy express 999 to flesh out the film.in short maetel is a princess on the planet la metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and it's artificial sun is dying. the planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story, thus increasing the sense of doom. in order to protect her subjects and family the queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of la metalle's people. enter lord hardgear, a robot / cyborg who provides the means for the job. through the film, the characters are left to question mechanisation, will they still be human? can hardgear be trusted? do souls and hearts remain? so for a fan of matsumoto's work, there's lots to enjoy, questions to be answered, themes continued, except it's obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction, as well as a fan curiosity. the negatives, foremost the animation, while galaxy express 999, a tv series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design, maetel legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to galaxy express 999. the design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that 'slide', as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms, a quick way of animating. however the few, yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences, repetition and in extra scenes. anyone who's seem the film will wonder how many times lord hardgear can drink the same glass of wine.next the story, while in concept everything sounds great, the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect, the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters, which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations. add to all of that some terrible character design, that seem lifeless, over exaggerated, and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film, at least the newcomers wouldn't be left baffled.and yet, it really has its moments, the ending at least is surprising. the plight of the citizens of la metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing; i guess i find that whole man-machine theme distressing. it's hard know who to recommend maetel legend to, since it's not well animated, written or executed, plus confusing once leiji matsumoto's mandatory cross-referencing is introduced. however i can't help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of three-nine occurs, now that's good cinema.1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you're a fan.

during the 1990's, several attempts have been made to revive old matsumoto's series. yoshinobu nishizaki tried to revive old yamato saga in form of a laughably bad "yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes. captain harlock suffered a confusing and pointless "harlock saga", while galaxy express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its name.if you've seen "queen millennia", you'll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. maetel legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter, also finding a way to suck at doing so.this movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie, mixes it with badly paced melodrama, and to add an insult to an injury, tosses in some of the most renowned characters from matsumoto's universe.the only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork, but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it can't save this movie from being a total loss.if you've enjoyed queen millennia or galaxy express, do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie. you'll thank me.

curse of the wolf starts as reluctant werewolf dakota (renee porada) manages to escape from her 'pack' & into the city where 6 months later she is working in a vet's. the rest of dakota's pack are unhappy & want her back, their leader michael (todd humes) says she will come back to them but fat werewolf franklin (brian heffron) picks her scent up & the pack decides to force the issue & get her back using her affections for her human friends including her boyfriend danny (dennis carver). can dakota save danny & finally rid herself of her werewolf pursuers? i doubt you will care...executive produced, written & directed by len kabasinski who also had a fairly large role in the film as stick i was dreading watching curse of the wolf since kabasinski was the man behind swamp zombies (2005) which is surely one of the worst films ever made, ever. unfortunately my worst fears were confirmed & one has to say that curse of the wolf is a truly horrible film in every way, both conceptually & technically. curse of the wolf is the sort of film where the low budget dictates what happens & the script rather than the script dictating the budget. you get the impression that everything was written & conceived to take advantage of the few sets & actor's they had, you can almost imagine the makers saying we've got a few actor's, some basic equipment & a couple of locations so lets make a horror film around them. the story is awful (michael finds the location of dakota by looking at a large dog two women are taking for a walk), the character's are awful (a big fat werewolf guy who farts a lot), the dialogue is awful (just about every line in the thing) & there's never any motivation for anything that happens (why are the pack so desperate to get dakota back?), people just do seemingly random things & since director kabasinski's background is in martial arts he insists in inserting lots of random martial arts fight sequences into the plot. no offence but this is meant to be a horror film not a martial arts one, isn't it? in fact apart from the presence of a few werewolves you would be hard pushed to describe curse of the wolf as anything approaching a horror film. at almost two hours in length it feels like it goes on forever & is so slow & uneventful it's just not funny.director kabasinski was obviously working on a low budget but film-making this bad should be a crime. there's no continuity between shots, the fight scenes look awful & are so poorly staged it's untrue & it's sometimes impossible to follow what's going on be it because of the choppy editing & poor camera angles or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally can't see a thing. seriously there are times during curse of the wolf where the screen is totally black & you can't see a thing, i would hate to have to sit through this watching it on a fuzzy low resolution vhs. the sound is awful too, you can hear the wind & breeze against the microphone! there are also lots of other unpleasant & unwanted ambient sounds during just about every scene. did the production actually have any lighting gear while making this? it doesn't feel like it. the special effects mostly consist of werewolf mask's that look like the sort of thing shops sell at halloween for the kids, basically they look awful.technically curse of the wolf is as bad as they come, i'm sorry because i know this had a low budget but it's truly horrible to sit through & try to garner some entertainment from. this is high school film student quality, i'm sorry if that sounds unkind but it's a fact. the acting is, well you can probably guess so i'll stop myself right here before i say something else negative, i mean i've done enough of that already & i really take no pleasure in it.curse of the wolf is terrible, both conceptually & technically this is a real chore to sit through. curse of the wolf is the type of film where while your watching it time seems to stand still, it's the type of film that lasts for almost two hours yet feels like two years. one of the worst films you or i am ever likely to see, definitely one to avoid.

this is my first review on imdb.com and probably first ever written review of a film i've done of my own accord - not for some class assignment. i think that fact alone says something about this movie... not a good thing! i am no seasoned journalist or critic (though i have seen my fair share of movies), but i found this particular film so terribly painful to watch, it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience. where better to do it than imdb? as i forced myself to sit through the movie, physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots, i was sure there would be some "light at the end of the tunnel" - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on. the movie ended and i was as enlightened as dog****. after several rewinds to review certain scenes i still could conclude nothing sensible. i found myself wanting to yell "does this make sense to anybody?" i would recommend to not waste your time, but then again if i were you i'd probably want to experience it myself. if that's the case, bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don't get bored.

i never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused. especially in french and the neighboring countries (in belgium, where i am located, for example), "baise-moi" was announced as the most shocking and the most thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. yeah right! it might be a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse?), but the weak and pointless plot surely didn't cause me to think much. "baise-moi" is another one of those "blame everything that goes wrong on society"-films and they're generally not very convincing. about 99% of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph-girls? the two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes. nadine just killed her roommate; manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train-station, late at night. they decide to travel around france together, leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop. although we're constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit through. like the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they run into (and kill) are very uninteresting. if people want to make porno movies, that's fine by me, but please don't pretend that it's art-house film-making. if you leave out the swearing and the hip camera-work, all there is to see is (not so) arousing pornography. cool soundtrack, though!

another french film with absurdity. baise-moi(f*ck me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f*ck. one of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend. second one is a hooker who kills her flatmate and sees her boyfriend being shot dead. after those incidents they meet at a tube station(both misses the last train)then the whole thing starts. they find a bound and come very close. they abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive around the country and have lots of sex. thats all about baise-moi really. we can see that they have no mercy for their victims. they even kill a woman for her money. both actresses are real porn stars in france that affects the movie in two different ways. they look so comfortable in sex scenes, nonetheless, they can't make the whole film worth watching as ,to me, the film does not require no further ability of acting than that. it is a version of thelma and louise on a different level. i could recommend you loads of things to do instead of watching baise-moi. so, bother to watch if you wanna see a pointless, kinky film. * out of *****

quite possibly one of (if not the) worst film ever conceived, cast and acted in the history of cinema. who on god's green earth would ever think to cast cameron diaz and james mardsen as a couple? she looked like his mother. god forgive me but i am just being honest. and that was the least of the many problems plaguing this horrible excuse for a film. it was a horrible statement against women but at least if you're gonna blame women for the problems of the world, tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills. everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the dvd.

i'm sick of the "open mind" argument. i'm generally quite open-minded, but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed." you know what, there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this. and just because someone out there isn't doesn't make it less so. there is, after all, a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should eliminate that feeling. otherwise we're no better than senseless living things.back to the film. another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men, which may be why men don't like it. but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn't make it great. maybe men shouldn't be turned on by what's dominating the movie industry, but is the answer for women to do the same? maybe, if you don't like movies, tv, and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, don't watch them.and if you're a director, don't make them.otherwise, some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this "movie" happen in real life.heck, some people seem to like it so much.

well, how to make a movie as provocative as possible? this cartoonishly straight shocker tries by having two low-life paris women (one prostitute, one recently raped ex-porn actress, no less) lash out and go on a national sex-and-killing spree- of men in particular. very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore "thelma & louise"- but it's done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message... and since we don't get very close to the protagonists, the violence actually feels muted and numbing- and maybe that's a good thing. as a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, i always welcome when the "serious" movie industry dares to contain full-on sex scenes. but the question is: does it work for the movie as a whole? is it any good? here, not very, although we're given a new meaning to the phrase "a shot in the ass"! 3 out of 10 from ozjeppe

while it's true that the movie is somewhat interesting, the execution leaves a lot to be desired (much like blood orgy of the leather girls, i spit on your grave, and born in flames, all superior). i don't think it's not porn, but porn is in the eye of the beholder: if it functions as porn for somebody, who am i to say that he/she is wrong? i was rather puzzled by the statement in winkimation's generally thoughtful review ("such a shame") that "for once we actually see men's faces when they come." a few years ago i did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and i recall seeing plenty of men's faces when they came. i think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn "stars" (and especially when that male is the director). though i unsurprisingly can't refer to any specific titles, i know that there are some instances in ron jeremy's, uh, work. i also don't know that i'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming.

i like to like movies, but i found nothing to like about the box. i was interested in the 'hook' of the plot, but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something, well i have news for them, the emperor has no clothes.the only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin, and corrupting mankind. i've heard that story before, and it makes less and less sense every time. it's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres, but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price.

hmph. soul plane supposed to be a "black comedy" spoof of a much well known movie, airplane. this movie, is black comedy done at it's worst. stereotypes can be funny, and a lot of times they are. but in this picture, it's disgusting. okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything crude that people associate with "urban" culture today.tom arnold's appearance in this movie, is this movie's saving grace if it ever had any. dl hughley should have never accepted the script. kevin hart makes a poor leading figure here... his appearance in this movie will probably grow annoying to many. method man and snoop's appearance were by far, their worst.i am just happy that i didn't pay to see this movie...

my friend made me watch this awful film.. ugh.. it was so stupid... its about some black guy who gets a plane company and turns it into a stupid pimp thingwith snoop dog acting as pilot for god knows why.. this movie is trashing white people and having many racist stereotypical events making fun of asains white people and trying to make the movie seem like all black people are cool pimps and all white people a losers... and black people get all the girls blah blah blah and so forth..i despise my friend for making me watch this movie.. i kept saying "god turn it off!!" and he's like "no i bet something funny is about to happen" we did end up finally turning it off half way through.. thank god...i recommend this movie to people with very very poor taste in humor..

now, this movie is the worst i have ever seen!! it is simply a disaster. i think it's really a sick movie, i just wasted my time watching this cheap crap. i can't believe anyone would produce such a disaster. such a waste of money and time. nothing to learn from this movie, it's just a hollow sick evil flick. i don't think they could've make it worse, this movie just earned it's title as the king of lowest crap. the acting is a disaster, the meaning...oh well there is no meaning just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the suffering child in the end of the movie, and the killing of the wife which again was another dumb blow to this movie. do yourself a favor, if you actually have some self respect, keep away from this awfulness!!!

this movie was just horrendous. how could anybody like this movie, and for the ones who liked it because of the jokes, they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad. ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes, this was just awful. it never had its moments, if it paid homage to 1980's, "airplane!", it needs to pay some more. awful acting, terrible script writing, even for a movie with mo'nique or tom arnold. this movie was bad from the beginning, but people might have seen the whole thing, by the thought that the plane would crash. one of the worse movies ever, stay away.

i gave soul plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would actually be something of comedic value in it. im not black, but that does not mean i cant appreciate black comedy. i know that because i happen to enjoy watching the wayans bros, good times and other series. i've seen crap movies and im not easily repulsed. as for soul plane, i didn't even bother finishing it. don't know if they managed to land the plane and i couldn't care less. it would be unfair to say i didn't find some parts funny as i did laugh, but i also laugh at youtube videos of skateboarders falling on their nuts so that doesn't say much. the men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas in mating season looking to "get some" whenever and where ever possible. and we wonder why all those stereotypes don't seem to disappear. to summarize: soul plane makes the harold and kumar series look like the godfather.

wow this really is stereotypical, terrible trash. i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this.i am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie, i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible movie.i will now be more wary when i watch late night movies.this is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence (though it could be), but i don't think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life. it makes the scary movie series look intelligent.1/10 i'd give it a 0 if they would let me

well to start with i'm straight up as black as black gets, and i can tell you it's very sad when black people think a "black movie" sucks. i can't say i've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story line.snoop is my dawg and all but he wasn't feeling this movie at all, i don't know how much they paid him to be in this bucket of crap called a movie, but i hope it's enough to wash the smell out.i'm all about supporting a bothers movie, but this one was bad, really really bad. it blew chucks in every aspect, no real plot, story sucked, cast couldn't act and the best one there was the white guy!i almost demanded a refund on my way out the door of the theatre, half the crowd up and left before it was over, i'm still wishing i had too. save yourself some pain and go see something else, anything else...

this "movie" and i say this lightly, is nothing but pure trash. i feel sorry for those people that actually wasted their money to go see this in theaters..i saw a screener of the movie from a friend and i've regretted it ever since. as a black woman, i am extremely embarrassed to have seen this. more so, i am extremely horrified that people of other races may have seen this as well and might believe it to be behavior of black people in general. it's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, horribly vulgar coarse jokes and lame one-liners bleated out by somewhat well known african american comedians who should have known better after reading this script! i must also mention the numerous rap and hip hop singers/rappers that populate the movie like it was an overlong music video---they had absolutely no place in the movie. i guess they were the "jiving & singing minstrels?" horrible. the "writers," producers and whoever had the stupidity to fund this "movie" should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to look at this crap nonstop for the rest of their lives. do-not-watch-this- movie!!! it's time wasted out of your life that you can never get back.

this movie wasn't too funny. it wasn't too horrible either. just a fun ride aboard the soul plane. it's a black-owned flight service with a kick-ass disco, beautiful bar, and pumping stewards. the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black (not race or color, but 'style') -owned plane with the same style of black humor. at times, there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the 'normal' lavatory in the 'normal' plane. check that out. there are lulls, however, and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot. watch to find out who it is. all in all, it's a fun movie. tom arnold adds to the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. this is one movie to watch when playing poker, when you're drunk, or just vegging.

"soul plane" is a horrible attempt at comedy that only should appeal people with thick skulls, bloodshot eyes and furry pawns. the plot is not only incoherent but also non-existent, acting is mostly sub sub-par with a gang of highly moronic and dreadful characters thrown in for bad measure, jokes are often spotted miles ahead and almost never even a bit amusing. this movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the "adult" section. ok?i can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof teabags or whatever.2/10

frankly i did not think there was anything humorous about this movie. it was really lame and poorly done with no plot whatsoever. surprisingly it got some chuckles from me at the beginning with the malcolm x terminal and that was about it. seriously soul plane made even the worst movies such as gigli look like a emmy winner. this movie is really not worth seeing unless of course you were blind like johnny witherspoon who played the blind man in the movie (another sad character). i cringed at majority of the stereotypic jokes and ruining tom arnold and d.l hughley by casting them in this movie. this movie could be summarized in just one sentence. nashawn wins $100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did i mention sex? if i could i would rate this movie in the negative integers, however, the beginning was amusing which brings this movie to a 1/10. doing the "t bag" pfft!

couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door. if they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. do they push the button? this is an odd film based on a richard matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair. the trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director richard kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making. is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones? at times it seems like it with talk of moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. is it a science fiction film? possibly, there are lots of questions about that mars project. and what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy? is this invasion of the body snatchers or a demonic take over film? don't know, maybe. and that's the problem there are lots of questions, most of them intriguing, but there are too many. little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way). i'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer kelly fills his script with simply too many that director kelly can't handle, or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit. it made me crazy. (i won't get into the two leads, cameron diaz and james marsden, who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting ) it's a heady mix that doesn't work (there are ultimately too many holes). i got to the end and suddenly realized i had no idea what i just saw. i really didn't like it, but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather. i'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything

i'm glad that i did not expect too much when i saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films. the storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters, and i was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. i also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. the first film had some good music, but the music in this film was unmemorable. in short, this film just did not do it for me. and, looking at other user feedback, it looks like it didn't do it for a lot of you. it's not worth watching.

i loved all dogs go to heaven so much that i went to see the sequel in the theater, and i can't remember being more disappointed by a movie. the story stank worse than an over-aged sack of manure. i mean, come on! how could carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was. plus depicting satan as a cat?!?! how cliché can you get? so much for the story. is it any wonder that don bluth, burt reynolds, melba moore, and vic tayback wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole? the animation was absolutely wretched. the colors were all washed out, and i can't count how many times i was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid. it had to be the worst animation i've ever seen! i usually like animated movies, but not this bomb!

i thought id check this film out as i'm currently making a film about a mysterious box, therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box.before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film. with actresses, like cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great. the acting was a sort of let down for the film, the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it unbelievable.the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down, this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was.this film had no middle to it. it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline. nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all,' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again, but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again. throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending. i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was.lets put the bad points to one side... i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it look excellent, this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be.this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it. parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't, it totally went against an audiences expectations, even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger, not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well, but this one didn't, it was a creative, different unusual film i thought, it had potential could of been better, disappointed didn't enjoy it, wouldn't buy it on dvd to be honest.

first time i ever felt i needed to write a review.i have seen thousands of movies in my life and i like a wide range of movies. i am reasonably opened minded, and can easily say i enjoyed a movie while still saying "yeah it was not good but i enjoyed it". i can appreciate the mastery of great movies like the shaw shank redemption, the godfather, and american history x. i can like good movies in a genre like horror, or comedy, even if the movie might not be that great. i can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (bloodsport). i also will try to rate movie fairly even if i did not like it. city lights by charlie chapin was not a movie i enjoyed, but i can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time.i think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating, should take a few ideas into account. try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was. do not let your personal bias affect the rating. also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.this "movie" was the worst piece of trash i have ever seen. 2 hours of my life where just stolen. the acting was awful, across the board. the scenes where choppy at best. however the real disgrace was the story. the first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point a to b. however after that it was a nightmare. they kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained. nothing really ever made sense, was steward dead, is he alive, did he hit by lighting, was it really lighting, was it aliens, is he an alien, etc. the ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions. the only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater.6.5/10??? what is wrong with some of you? i will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this, we did think "what would make it better?", and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie. what can i say misery loves company. that is really the only reason i can see for a 6.5 rating.do not waste your life!

the box (2009) * cameron diaz, james marsden, frank langella, james rebhorn, holmes osborne, sam oz stone, celia weston. truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend richard matheson's sci-fi chiller "button, button" by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker richard kelly who truly stretches a small, well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'wtf'-a-thon! mysterious (and ridiculously maimed!) man, langella, posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling' couple diaz and marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button, that when pushed, will kill some stranger in the world (!) sure strings are attached but does that really matter here? what does is why in the name of god does kelly trowel on so much oddness (i.e. nose-bleeds; watery transport systems  that's right  watery.transport.systems) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities). if this sounds like a bad twilight zone episode you are half right (the '80s tv re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) one of the year's worst films.

i'm not a big fan of musicals, although this technically might not qualify as a musical. but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies. it was mediocre at best.hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role. it just didn't work for me. julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could, but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving, deceptive spy. sorry, i know that is classic stereotyping on my part. but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking. i always thought of her as more matronly, but then surely that's a result of her roles in sound of music and mary poppins. no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role. she was quite beguiling in appearance here, but i still didn't buy her as a spy.i couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which i usually never do - i'm always shushing everybody). so that tells you how little it held my attention. don't waste your time!

mockney comes to brighton; despite a poor reception in the british press and state-funded-british-cinema written all over it i rather hoped that we'd get a bit of the grimy, hard-nosed london-by-the-sea of graham greene.it doesn't even aspire to this. characters straight out of their clone 'n crimp trailers reproduce guy ritchie's types. the format looks more like a british tv series than a film (brighton is a backdrop goldmine, wasted with plastic studio work).i watched this film in pursuit of a good performance from famke janssen... she's a bit slick for this company, her brand of big screen impertability belonging more to blockbusters such as deep rising. as for acting (a role even!) the search continues. circus is boring. 3/10

boring, cliched and predictable. the only original bit was the brighton location for gangsters. it is certainly no "lock stock etc......." hannah was likeable in "sliding doors". in "circus" i developed no empathy with his character and couldn't give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend. although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise i was so uninterested i didn't even care why the movie was given the name "circus"....... booooring.......don't visit this big top.

this film could of been a hell of a lot better if they didn't use brian conley as a gangster and if they didn't start the film with christopher biggins.when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on. there were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable. the film deserves a 0, but seeing as i there isn't a 0 i gave it a 1.i wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy, i would rather poke out my eyeballs with some rusty scissors than watch this film again. i'm telling you, that was an hour and a half of my life i won't get back.if you want to watch a gangster film, don't get this. watch "going off big time" or "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" instead.

i found this an awfully disappointing experience! but i have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.this "felicia's journey" is intriguing. it has drama. but it is full of stereo-types! so it only serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth, beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of "news" that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! it is so exaggerated, it reminds me of the fairytale of "little red ridinghood"! consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her 'romeo' who didn't give her an address versus the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the 'helping hand' befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer! it seems to suit the directors & management team that no-one has faith or prays to god, even in their times of desperation! so in these early settings, it orchestrates & tells much of what is to come! a nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution, without truth or integrity or credibility! ...then one twist & it's all over. what a disappointment! if you want to see a much superior movie that investigates similar themes with much more credibility, with much more powerful insight, watch the 1983 paul cox/norman kaye "man of flowers" movie!!! unlike here, you will not be disappointed!

you just need to see this as a poorly executed anti abortion propaganda and you will realize just how bad it really is. the main message of this movie is that even the sickest of persons can't commit an abortion. if you ask that's not a long way away from blowing up abortion clinics. so this guy wants to kill some poor girl but he has to convince her to do an abortion first. what a load of crap. and the worst part is that he has an convincing argument (bringing a child into a loveless environment), but that is supposed to be dismissed because he's a freak anyway. and the part with the bible pushers...first they throw this girl out just because she explains someone stole her money (that rule must be in the bible somewhere) and then on the end they are some sort of angel like deus ex machina delivering the killer from evil by harassing him on his front yard. come on. other downpoints include a very confusing scenario (and i don't mean in a good way)...so this guy is just some psycho why? because his mother fed his some liver once? and i don't know about the rest of you but he seemed like the nicest person in the world throughout the whole move! even though he was a wearing girlie clothes, stealing money and taping girls in his car. if you forget the idiot story, this movie has a really great cinematography and bob hoskins was really great, and it has one of those funny little english cars in it. if it was actually about some psycho killer i'd give it a 7 at least.

the tv announcer who introduced this late one saturday night said it should have won oscars. quite a statement for a film i'd never heard of...though why i should have taken any notice of a tv announcer, i don't know. in the event, said announcer was talking tripe.it's a dreary, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. i couldn't get on with hoskins' awful burr-ming-gum accent. can't see any advantage in it being set in the midland's anyway. unresolved threads abound...and i wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense. and what about when hoskins' says he'll pick felicia up from outside her b&b although she never told him where exactly she was staying??? or her buying into the funeral that clearly never took place (and where was she during those days???) clumbsy and ill-thought through bits of business if you ask me.it's a thriller without thrills. it's full of pretentious bits of business. it's depressing... didn't like it. thought it was rubbish. wouldn't recommend it. 'nuff said.

ohhhh man this movie is awful!!this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name, or no name. well, to be fair, i guess most canadian movies give canadian cinema a bad name.next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie. it's like a drunken snail making its way to die.thank goodness melanie doane is nice to look at. she's the only thing that kept me watching. unfortunately, the rest of the movie kept interrupting.good for a laugh, though, if you're having a bad canadian movie night, though.did i mention melanie doane? the only good point (too bad they didn't have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a time).another addition in the canadian hall of stinking movies.

this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:"quirky" and obnoxious characters (a few); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; a "quirky" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of "gotta get out of this town"; downright booooring.and it succeeds on all counts.something to note, though. i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-northern exposure "quirky" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? and this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. i don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. huh? what did i miss?avoid. unless for laughs. or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.

the brave one seems to indicate that the main character, of course, is brave. i'd disagree. the more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her- getting brutally beaten along with her fiancée who doesn't live another day from it- is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society. jodie foster's character, erica, is a radio personality who's niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on. we're given no real depth aside from 'she had someone she loved, he died, the police don't pursue it, she gets a gun, yada-yada-yada, she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective' into the character, and so were left with something leftover from past movies: the vigilante code of justice, where taking the power in one's own hands is all there is. but we're never too sure if erica is sane or not, if the filmmakers take a position one way or another (that is until the end, which is such a stupid message to take anyway, dog included as overbearing metaphor), while making the new york city of today, which has become significantly safer than, say, twenty years ago, look like you'll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway car.there could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this- perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with terence howard's detective, who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isn't his and a woman who he's not linked to and a step-father who, i don't know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude- but we're left to a script that's both ham-fisted and disjointed with logic. it becomes laughable, for example, to see that at first the logical side- of erica unable to really shoot properly, as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband- and then giving way to the illogical of her crack-shot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over. it doesn't help that jordon's style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable: it's called a stedi-cam for a *reason*, not because it can weave in and out.ironically, the script and direction become very good, or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances: when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge, caught between a video-taped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting. and when erica first comes back on the air to her radio show, and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick, and speaks out a 'from-the-heart' about how afraid she is- this scene, from foster's performance, to the clear direction and script, is the best scene in the film. but aside from that, there's just a lot of posturing into a psychology that's flimsy: is she a de niro in taxi driver or a bronson in death wish? we have her narration over scenes, some of it doesn't have to do at all with her radio show, observing how disgusted she is with walking around at night, nothing to do but her self-imposed task of cleaning up the streets. but unlike death wish, a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario, the path of endless violence just heeds to a message, one that won't be news to anyone who's seen a second of lifetime movie-of-the-week melodrama.the actors make do with what's given, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated, the hackneyed plot turns, and the plain old inexplicable (plus the unintentionally hilarious, like a few expletives shouted by howard after getting shot in one scene), and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger. it's a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of genuine interest and clear-headed convention-bending.

are we serious??? i mean wow ... just, wow. i think i saw this flick in an old issue of war journal. this is pathetic, originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea what we receive is a bland re-do of an old plot line and to "switch it up" we just change the gender or race of the original character it's moronic and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it ... but i guess this is just a rant and will most likely fall on deaf ears to engrossed with the sound of another turd hitting the toilet water like the best western since 3:10 to yuma ... (wait for it)... 3:10 to yuma! thank you hollywood for killing film as an art form and turning it into a commercial barrage of neo-pop junk and blatant retardation ... wonderful!!!

this film is terrible, and don't blame jesus franco, because its not his fault.this film was shot silent over many years by welles as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting. how much film welles actually shot is not clear, although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several "key" sequences, such as quixote in a movie theater, are in the hands of collectors or backers who wouldn't give them up. the film here is just under two hours and i would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length. i'm of the opinion, based on several comments that welles made before his death, that he never really intended to release the film, but was putting it together as a personal toy.what exists here is for the most part is beautifully shot, but dramatically dead. very little happens for the first hour other than quixote and sancho wandering around the country side. dull would be a kind description of the material. in the second hour quixote ends up in modern spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life. this isn't to say that there isn't a few nice moments, the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good, but mostly this is a vast waste of film and time."completed" by jesus franco, who was welles' assistant director on the vastly superior chimes at midnight, we have a bunch of film fragments that have been put together as best as possible. many people have crucified franco as having been the reason the film stinks, but frankly one can not make a good movie from crap material. one critic has gone on record as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970's, which meant that franco made this version up on his own and ruined it. while that maybe true, i've run across stories of welles cutting and re-cutting the film many many times over the years since he could never get it right.this film is terrible no matter how you slice it.ultimately i'm left wondering just how good a film maker welles was. aside from citizen kane almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or interfered with so we are left with the excuse that many of his films "would have been better if only...". how do we know? how can we know? perhaps welles was a man of less talent than we thought and many of his borderline films just aren't that good, and never would have been. while this is no place to argue the place of welles in film history, the surviving material of don quixote, assuming it approximates what welles intended (i think it does), is a good case for rethinking how we view the man and his work.4 out of 10 for the good sequences (though 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)

an atrocious offense to the memory and genius of welles, this senseless assemblage of self-indulgent improvisation on a grand theme should have been locked up in storage along with a number of other unfinished welles' projects no one has ever seen. now we know why! to add additional insult to prior injury, the appalling english language dubbing by amateur america dubbing actors and even the great man himself only heightens all the sloppy mistakes in story-telling and construction. it's as if every weekend some good hearted spanish soul gave orson a few pesos, a 35mm camera and some short-ends of negative film left over from some other production and told welles to drive out to the spanish countryside and just keeping shooting anything and everything until the film stock ran out. it's true that if orson had really shaped this film himself instead the notorious jesus franco, he might have thrown out 85% of what he shot, but we will never know. as welles never took the time to edit his own work here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do so, he is not entirely blameless for the debacle. those who wish to prove that in his early days welles was the luckiest of young men because he surrounded himself with the likes of john houseman, herman mankewiecz, greg toland, bernard hermann and robert wise need no better proof of his adult inadequacies than this mess of a film. in his sad old age welles was capable of doing anything when he needed a few bucks or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. the devil certainly got his due with this one!

(this review is based on the english language version)orson welles' legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. it should have been left as such, not thrown together in this clumsy, boring compilation of whatever material was available.while i'm sure it was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to welles' vision, they've also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version upon audiences.the first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio. not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances, they're also inconsistent - welles' original recordings (using his own voice, as he often did) have been retained in a handful of scenes, & they don't match at all. there hasn't been the slightest attempt at consistency. add to that an extremely empty sound mix which has only a bare minimum of sound effects & atmos - a long sequence during a huge festival (including the running of the bulls) sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd that's meant to be in the thousands.however, the real problem is the unavoidable fact that 'don quixote' was incomplete, & it's glaringly obvious from watching this. the film consists of a handful of scenes strung together & dragged out to ridiculous lengths just to make up the running time. case in point - the sequence where sancho searches for don quixote in the city goes on forever. it's just sancho approaching people in the crowd, asking them the same questions over & over again - there is no way that welles could ever have intended using every single take in its entirety, but that's what appears here. it lasts over twelve minutes, when, in fact, it would most likely have lasted about two minutes absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film. while the start of the film is relatively complete & rather well done, the rest has massive holes which simply can't be filled with endless overlay of spanish countryside & still more shots of don quixote & sancho going back & forth. there's also no ending. no resolution, no conclusion, no punchline, no point.although there is material in private collections that was unavailable to the filmmakers, that couldn't possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete, coherent work. welles simply didn't complete shooting, largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finish.however, putting aside the fact that it wasn't complete, & never could be, one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough. unfortunately, by putting it all together in such a slipshod manner, one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall. in particular, what was clearly a terrific performance from akim tamiroff as sancho is utterly ruined with the new voice & with long, drawn out scenes that eventually cause him to be simply irritating.orson welles' vision for this film was something far more ambitious & complex than a simple retelling of the story of don quixote, but that's what has been attempted here, & as such, the point is lost. the only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been welles himself, & he didn't.the footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary chronicling the whole saga of welles trying to make the film. welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a doco: "when are you going to finish don quixote?"

this is a documentary about homeless women. it was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are engaged socially - having jobs and lasting friendships - but are in situations where they can not afford housing.i found some of the women covered to be interesting, but there was little focus or progression in the story. the direction and editing failed to maintain my attention. there were differences in the stories of these women, of course, but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on any one of them in more depth.i made it to the end of the movie, but it was a rather boring journey.

"black vengeance" is an alternate title for "ying hung ho hon" aka "tragic hero" (1987). i have just seen this on vhs, together with the first part of the story, "gong woo ching" ("rich and famous"), also 1987. (the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-dvd set of movies starring rod perry (the black gestapo), fred williamson (black cobra 2), richard lawson (black fist). the fourth movie is called "the black six"). strangely, while the characters retain their original names in "rich and famous", in "black vengeance" chow yun-fat's character is named eddie shaw, alex man (man tze leung) is harry, and andy lau is called johnny. also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films. perhaps that was the year they were american-dubbed. according to the release dates given on imdb "tragic hero" was released before "rich and famous". was there any reason for releasing the sequel first? despite some users' comments, i enjoyed these films, although they aren't among cyf's best such as "the killer" and "hard-boiled" which are truly astonishing. however,if one day i come across a 2-dvd set of "rich and famous" and "tragic hero" i won't hesitate to buy it. hopefully, these comments about "black vengeance" clear up, which was also for me, a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yun-fat's filmography.

danny lee's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film, even though it has an excellent cast including chow yun-fat, carina lau, andy lau, shing fui-on and alex man. cyf plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but alex man, a total psycho who has a big grudge against cyf, won't let him. cyf tries to escape to malacca but to no avail. after his family is blown to bits, his cronies dead or turncoat, wounded and broke, cyf returns to hong kong to get into some serious revenge.it sounds a lot better than it is. cyf is well-dressed and handsome, looks pained, grimaces and cries on cue, but somehow or another you just don't care. andy lau looks great, but that's about it. carina lau has a tiny, tiny little part which was nice, but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that. alex man is a cartoon villain he's so over-the-top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden-variety nut.danny lee is great though - too bad he's only a small blip on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie.rent it, don't buy it. or just skip it altogether.this is the sequel to "rich and famous", even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously; it was released first because of cyf's boxoffice power.

"tragic hero" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. also, this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was (at the time). however, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other triad thrillers being released in hong kong at the time.one reason is the acting. with the exception of chow yun fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable. the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness. as a result, we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don't particularly care what occurs with these characters.another reason is its lack of focus. the narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film, but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency. the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing, not knowing what the character's motivations are.the film's climax does contain a decent gun fight, but again since we don't care about the characters, we don't care who lives or who dies; the scene loses it's intensity and suspense because of this. the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature, with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing.in general, this is a strictly average film and isn't recommended to the general film viewer... only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of chow yun fat should consider this film for viewing.

you'd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their employer couldn't help but be gripping, but then you'd be wrong.there is no plot. there is no character development. there is no redeeming visual beauty.this movie is a waste of time. the exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil, their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque, the class relationships are glossed over, and employer is a silly caricature.ponderous silences and period clothing do not equal depth of meaning.

well, this was my first imax experience so i was pretty blown away about that, primarily; although with hindsight, i can't help wishing that it had been some other (less monochrome)film.magnificent desolation very much had the "programme for schools" feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading national geographic magazine in 3d. weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some powerpoint presentation. there was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens; seemingly at your feel, that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest, that may have had more to do with me being an imax virgin.the commentary, provided by tom hanks, i personally found very, (what's a nice way to put it??) "flag-wavingly nationalistic" which didn't go down too well in central london, judging by remarks overheard as we left.over all, i loved the imax experience, but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day. the moon isn't a particularly colourful subject and to be honest, a lot of the 3d effects were lost in the monochrome scenery. all that would have been well, were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with american schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit

the world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as dvd and cd players are steadily decreasing in size. it is obviously much cooler to have a smaller ipod than a larger one. this is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the imax, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. as long as the material's right.the main problem with 'magnificent desolation: walking on the moon 3d" is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage. it is dull, uninformative, and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as neil armstrong and buzz aldrin. another problem with the film is that it doesn't even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon. instead, the writers have simply pressed copy and paste and hired famous voices such as morgan freeman, bill paxton, and matt damon to imitate their famous quotes. this tactic is unrelentingly repetitive and tedious.i'd say without one moment's hesitation that i didn't learn one piece of information from the film that i didn't already know.and it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its insistent sentimentality. every three minutes there seems to be a cue for tom hanks' voice to say something like "without the contributions of these brave men and women..." watching the film is like watching a bad commercial. for forty agonizing minutes.1/4

the director is sweet, as is his co-directing wife shira geffen, but their movie sucks. it has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: "amélie" meets "breaking the waves" meets "pauline at the beach". you walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal-immigrant-come-social-worker with a heart of gold. it feels like there's more than one truly touching story hidden in the script, but at face value it's a truckload of wasted story lines and sentimental bullshit. hard to sit out as it is.

i went to see this because i'd never seen tel-aviv, where the story is set. i was disappointed, since it doesn't offer many views of israel's largest metropolis. it's also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.the main protagonist is batya, a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings. her parents evidently don't care about her very much, and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, batya feels compelled to take care of her. the little girl doesn't speak, and batya can't give her to social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed. so she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof, and when it comes time to work in the evening, she has to take the little girl with her. the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in batya's work performance.another main character is keren, who is getting married. at her wedding party (where batya is of course working), she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies' room cubicle whose door won't open, and so she and her new husband cannot take the caribbean vacation they've planned. they end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view. it smells bad, there is noise from the traffic, and keren is complaining all the time. her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman  a writer  who is also staying in the hotel, and keren worries that he has slept with this stranger.the third main character is a filipino woman named joy who looks after old people. the old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no english, only german and hebrew. joy speaks english but no hebrew or german. joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the philippines, and wants to buy him a toy boat, as he has asked. she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. the daughter of the old woman, who hired joy, is an actress appearing in some sort of post-modern "physical theater" adaptation of hamlet, and does not get along with her mother.the way in which these three storieswhich intersect momentarilyresolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound. i didn't get it. there is a fantasy element to batya's relationship with the little girl, and maybe batya's non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship. when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind, and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real-life ship. keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room, and a narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle. but what does all this mean? i thought about it for a while and realized i wasn't going to lose any sleep in the process. if anyone out there has a clear idea of what it's all about, maybe they can fill me in.

when the film started i got the feeling this was going to be something special. the acting and camera work were undoubtedly good. i also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. the film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.however, as the film went on, the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. i was unable to understand the connection between the stories. all i could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles. without that connection, i was just left with a few unremarkable short stories.am surprised it did so well at cannes

only if its the last thing yo do and your humour is evaporated should you ever attempt to watch this. if you do, watch it alone invite no one, they will never return to watch another movie with you. it might be an excellent tool for that very purpose, invite people you want to get rid of in your life.apparently i need to write more about his film in order to qualify as a review. this is sweet irony for this film it really does sum it up perfectly. after wasting my time it wastes more of your time. it does have a function i take it all back.i recommend this film, watch it, its provocative, really go ahead watch it.

a horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered pc clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). the movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. even the gifted tommy lee jones does not manage to salvage this bomb. i urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed hollywood.the two stars are given solely to the cgi-people and the pr-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it.

riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the la brea tar pits in los angeles. even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.i have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his/her career. this was tommy lee jones's turn. although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that). most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing; a few of the actors simply phone in their roles. anne heche deserves special hall of shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. she is about as convincing in this role as pee wee herman, and even he would have at least done a better acting job.since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here, i would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends, and have a game of "find the scientific absurdities." the loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like "everybody looks the same" over and over. here's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect: a scheme to blow up a building is devised, engineered, and the dynamite set and detonated all within a space of about 20 minutes. let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clichés: divorced dads, scientists who get ignored by everybody, obnoxious cops, tough street kids, bratty teenagers, greedy investors etc.; all are present and in abundance. the film also bashes you over the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness.for fans of cheese and silliness only. all other viewers: beware.

this movie is a real waste of time and effort. the film lacks plot and depth. the visuals are decent but nothing to write home about. there are far better films out there.

when i saw this movie, all i could think was: what a disaster! no i'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. i have seen a lot of movies, but this is certainly one of the worst ever. i don't care about the fact if a volcano erupting underneath downtown l.a. is possible or not. perhaps it isn't, but even than this could have been a good movie... but it sure isn't and i'll explain you why.i don't know how much lava flows out of an average volcano, but what i do know is that the volcano in this movie makes the vesuvius, etna and mount pinatubo together look like a little barbecue. i don't think there has ever been so much lava flowing out of a volcano as what we see in this film. i'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie, but i really wonder why he all spent it on the special effects and not on the script and the actors. i'm not saying that he should have hired a top cast, but this really is the opposite of what i would call good acting. their performances are so unbelievably poor that it makes the entire movie even worse.and what's wrong about the script you probably ask yourself. well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea of people standing a few yards or even a few feet from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for the heath? or people sinking in the earth when the flow of lava isn't even two foot high? i'm sure i wouldn't be proud if i wrote such a script, but apparently there are script writers in hollywood who don't mind about believability as long as it pays good money! very good money!!!when you see the movie, you'll probably agree with me that this is one of hollywood's worst disaster movies, not worth more than a 3/10.

the scriptwriters, directors, and actors have lost sight of the cornerstone of a good story - the concept of suspension of disbelief. in volcano, the concept goes up in smoke almost as quickly as the city. contrary to earlier commentators, i much preferred dantes peak amongst the 97 vintage of volcano movies.

i saw the trailer for this film before watching titanic, and i must admit that it whetted my appetite. volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. but what a damp squib. corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. the stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. but then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. this movie ranks just in front of cruise ii and twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling. this does have some reasonable effects, but overall its a 1 out of 10. don't waste your time

considering the subject matter, i thought that this film would at least be enjoyable, if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece. i was wrong. i was still waiting for something to happen and it finished - i thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting. the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition.

this film is all right, fairly silly and to be taken lightly. but what i can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's illegaly sentimental comment near the end: "look, they all look the same". isn't that by far passing the good taste standards? i thought it was revolting, as were the heroic, unselfish acts by some of the people in this film. i'm not saying it won't happen like that, but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn.

i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie. what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles? the fact is that there are no volcanoes in los angeles. this movie should not be filmed in los angeles, it should be filmed in honolulu hawaii. hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in hawaii's state capital. this movie should be filmed in hawaii because this is the real idea and not in los angeles. there are earthquakes in los angeles, but there are no volcanoes. to be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish. in conclusion, i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense.

volcano is set in los angeles where a minor earthquake has just hit, vacationing boss of the o.e.m. (the offcie of emergency management) mike roark (tommy lee jones) decides to cut his holiday short & go in, once there he sees that everything is alright but then drives off to the epicentre of the quake where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind. mike isn't sure what to think so he brings geologist dr. amy barnes (anne heche) in to try & explain things, unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake & erupts at the la brea tar pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets engulfing anything & everything it touches in flames. mike, his men & the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava & save as many lives as possible...directed by mick jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting volcano during 1997 with dante's peak (1997) being released a mere two months or so before volcano was & while dante's peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it's slightly better & more plausible than volcano is. the script here is total nonsense & is not based in reality at all, underground rivers of lava that seem to appear & then disappear just as quick, various character's standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat (when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine, as far as i am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) & it constantly happens, helicopters flying is clouds of ash (in reality it would be impossible), one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava (what about down the other streets & other directions?), being able to blow a perfect trench in a street & then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam & when kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there & watches two firemen get burned to death & waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire, despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy's do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through & loads more besides like that massive building falling on tommy lee & his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards. the character's are awful too although they were not as clichéd as usual with no romance blossoming between tommy lee & anne heche & minimal city official's who try to shut tommy lee & anne heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers. there's a few badly written & at times embarrassing moral moments as los angeles pulls together, the black guy & that semi racist cop who warm to each other & by the end are wishing each other well & that little kid at the end when he says 'everyone looks the same' is cringe worthy & is surely a ham-fisted attempt & trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings & we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together. having said that i think volcano is one of those so bad it's good films, it entertains & it moves along at a decent pace but just don't expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either.i suppose a film like volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70's disaster film such as the poseidon adventure (1972) or earthquake (1974) but on a huge budget with modern effects work. speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much & the set-pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, sure there are a few impressive explosions & a few ok river of lava flowing through los angeles effects but little else. generally volcano just isn't very exciting & while occasionally unintentionally funny & completely ridiculous it doesn't really work in the way the makers intended.with a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 it opened to a little under $15,000,000 at the box-office, it looks alright & there's lots of fire but nothing stands out & volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall. filmed in los angeles i think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations. the cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue & ridiculous set-pieces to contend with, tommy lee jones deserves better than this.volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses, it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself. worth it for a few unintentional laughs & the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great & i doubt i would ever want to see it again.

hahahahah probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen. obviously this isn't intentional though. it takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). it certainly made me laugh. the acting makes arnie look like a rsc thespian. it is amazing that films like this get commissioned. a more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about £20 to make. ($40) i can see some guy pitching the film to a film company "well there's this big volcano and it erupts in a city....pretty radical hey" if you can find it in the dollar bins, maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good.

the story of a volcano erupting downtown l.a. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. this one though, is missed bigtime. the movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.im in agreement with a lot of comments that lee jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. in this one, he is heading the emergency office. being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. clever thinking. ann heche touching walls and walking in tunnels that suppose to be 678 degrees fahrenheit. yea right. aside from the bad acting those factual errors make the film look almost as silly as armageddon. the only good point of this movie is that there is no ben affleck to make matters even worse. avoid this movie at all costs.

okay, enough. every time i think i've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that i think that no one could possibly find something to praise, i just come to the imdb where i'm greeted with the usual inane "undiscovered masterpiece" "great film" - i mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess i just watched on the new fox/mgm/ua dvd. there are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning. and then, after ninety-three interminable minutes, it just stops and the end credits begin. then there's another scene. the dvd is fairly wretched, which suits the film. the source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown. it's hard to imagine this film followed get carter. the critics and the public got this one right back then - it was lambasted and a box-office disaster, and rightfully so. but you pundits keep on trying. and i'll keep on trying to find a movie that doesn't have someone who raves about it.

what bird is that ? a maltese falcon. the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael caines hair. which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. salutes to raymond chandler and humphrey bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. the reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - this film is what the title suggests...

i watched this video because i like malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. the movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. you had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. it had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.in short, i'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again. it was so bad, i actually couldn't fall asleep. there are quite a few "eurotrash" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. this is one of them. on the bright side, who is nadia cassini? never before have i seen a more beautiful set of legs. she is the one saving grace of this movie.disturbing, too, was the cruel boar hunt depicted in the closing credits. a boar that was released on someone's property (malta has very few native mammals; all of them small - rats, bats, etc.) and then set upon by dogs before it was shot. oh, well - go visit malta anyway despite this film - it's a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.

dryly irreverent, but sadly unfunny satire of detective movies, with stony-faced michael caine playing a british author of trashy crime stories traveling to the mediterraean to assist in writing the memoirs of a would-be gangster; soon, he realizes he's being followed and his life is in danger. caine narrates the proceedings with considerable sly wit and low-keyed sarcasm, but his actual performance is bereft of energy (caine's shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere, and he connects with nobody on the screen). other cast members (particularly mickey rooney, a silver-haired lionel stander, and lizabeth scott) do very well in colorfully outré roles, though al lettieri has an insulting part as an apparent cross-dressing homosexual (lettieri gets insulted without being able to defend himself, an unenviable position). writer-director mike hodges has the germ of a good idea (satirize the detective movies of the 1940s without compromising the hard-boiled talk and milieu), but he hasn't a very sharp sense of humor. when a bogart lookalike--asking a question about a falcon--is the best joke, what follows is anemic indeed. ** from ****

one of the worse gay-related movies i have ever seen. since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. therefore, since colton ford (aka glen) laid his life open for all to see, i guess he's fair game to criticize. and that's not hard to do. here goes. 50 something glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (i guess 11 films makes him a "star") being gay and forty, i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover. personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles. face it, guys, he's no jeff stryker, jim bently or casey donovon. that's ok, though. the purpose of these films takes place in about 6.5 minutes, so they all pretty much have the same requirements, if you know what i mean.so glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. i wonder why? was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film. and according to the film it's not just porn flicks he indulges in, it's living in a house with other "stars" where people can hook into their bedroom, the bathroom and where ever via webcams . it's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party. strip gigs at clothing optional "hotels". doing something called meth which i presume is a drug. and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you ---- because he's "legit" now. oy!the only interesting, non-cardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name. and considering this is a documentary, well, porn is as porn does. you can tell he's most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star.glen has one hyper-nellie manager (kyle) who wants to "sell' him as a porno-participant in hopes of getting him gay-club gigs. he tries to do the svengalli-routine. "wear this" "don't smile" "say this" in what amounts to controlling issues. but our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. that's the first mistake. i'm not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager, they're not going to get far. kind of like: he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.all of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information. drum roll, please. he's bad. he sucks. his singing talent ranks up there with ashlee simpson. it's hard to root for someone who -- while trying make his dream come true --- at 50! --- doesn't work like normal people. no job. can you say lazy-ass? and the whining, and the "why don't they accept me." song and dance. and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he spouts off, "why don't i have a record deal by now." what? actors are waiters. writers work in low-level newspapers or mags -- whatever. this guy is above that. it's true. he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it. whine. whine whine. his lover leaves him to return to nursing but i tell ya i wouldn't want that moron dispensing medical care to me. both of them were useless. airheads. the movie is useless. unless you really like whine and cheeesy people stay away. do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people, there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.

for the first fifteen minutes the story of naked fame is interesting: two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting. the two very buff and preening men are colton ford and blake harper. with the aid of kevin aviance and marc berkely, colton makes a dance track that is then marketed in new york with the hopes that colton ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer touting his background as a porn star for pr.the remainder of the film is grumbling and in-fighting and commentary by porn producer chichi larue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and doldrums. not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away form a successful career (though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost) into an alternative one. it is just that a one-note song wears thin quickly. grady harp, november 05

this was one of the slowest movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. after the introduction where we are given the backstory of "something" killing a couple people in a farm house, we are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm - and nothing happens for a looooong time. then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm and nothing happens again for a very long time. then finally the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends. in between its all about how this family had to move out becuz the girl got in some trouble back home and they have no money and its done so poorly that i could care less about these pathetic people. i cannot believe i actually went to the theatres to see this! not only did this movie suck, but some a$$hole answered his cell phone, dumb morons were making noise and the movie sucked. thats why theaters suck - bad movies, overpriced crappy food, and idiots in the theatre, i'm staying home and watching dvds from now on, at least i could smoke if i was at home while watching this stupid movie. stay home and bake some pie rather than going to a theatre to see this piece of typical crap. dumb stupid crap.

my take: yet another lame pg-13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plot.the spirits move. the walls creak. there's something wrong in the basement. these, along with several other horror movie clichés haunt the walls of yet another house in the country in the sam raimi-produced the messengers, a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown in on a plot savagely recycled from better (and sometimes, even worse) horror movies of the past.when the solomon family moves into an old south dakota farmhouse, in yet another attempt by dad (dylan mcdermott) to reconnect with the family, especially with their formerly drunk-driving daughter jessica (the underrated kristen stewart), in the more subtle countryside than their home in chicago. the horror ensues when jessica begins to get little surprise visits from the house's poltergeists. thinking she's some teenage girl who cried wolf, her parents don't believe her. how could they? the real horror in the messengers is waiting for which horror movie it will savage next. will it be an angry flock of crows wanting more than the family's crops (a direct rip-off of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece the birds)? will it be the haunted house with a history dating back from the amityville horror or poltergeist? or will it be the grotesque phantoms taken from your familiar recent horrors like the ring and the grudge? heck, the movie even manages to rip-off a scene or two from some truly bad horror movies like amityville 3-d and the mediocre cold creek manor. perhaps all the pang brothers really wanted to do was a b-level horror movie, but did it have to be this bad? couldn't they rip-off from the best? avoid it.rating: * out of 5.

special sneak previews are always a good time. no matter what movie it is you are seeing, the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film, like free stuff, thought it'd be something to do, or just got lost. either way, no matter how good or bad the film, the audience alone will make it enjoyable. now when said movie is a pg-13 pseudo- horror film (can you really delve into horror when the mpaa is on your back censoring everything?) you know there will be chatter, laughing, and breath holding. with the messengers, the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen. as for the actual movie, i feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare/fade-to-black/show aftermath progression these films have. in the end we are shown a boring, plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense.the story is a common one. a family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other. once settled in, the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them. of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late. i will credit the pang brothers, (directors of the acclaimed the eye that i would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without hollywood interferencesupposedly reshoots on the messengers were done by someone else, but the brothers retained credit; it's a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference), for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh. unfortunately, though, i also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness. similar to why i disliked what lies beneath, i couldn't stand the drawn out suspense, which goes so far as to make it laughable. when our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static, oddly composed close-ups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing. for being only 84 minutes, i almost think it would have worked better even shorter.besides a very effective opening sequence, featuring the fantastic jodelle ferland, (strangely playing a boy), and a great atmospheric credit sequence, the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting. except for penelope ann miller, who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then, after a few scenes, made me understand why i never asked that question in the years she was absent, and dustin milligan, completely lacking in credibility, the acting is very strong. dyan mcdermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times. he has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious, dramatic role. william b. davis (everyone's favorite cancerman) is used effectively as an almost foreboding character, sadly not utilized more. our true stars are kristen stewart and john corbett. stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and panic room on her resume. as for corbett, if he didn't pull off his role, the entire movie would have unraveled completely. i do wish he would be given more work as i've enjoyed him since the under-appreciated series "the visitor"i still need to check out his first role in "northern exposure," a show i haven't yet been able to catch up on. it's a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated my big fat greek wedding.if anything, the messengers gave me a nice introduction to the pang brothers' work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their chinese horror catalog. the mood and performances were there; it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film. if they delved more into other characters, rather than just stewart's, it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing. if our protagonist is the only one being attacked, there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her. the moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler. i am excited, however, for the free comic book given away after the special screening, as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise.

let's cut through everything in the first paragraph. "the messengers," the newest film by the pang brothers (danny and oxide), as a horror movie, is profoundly bad. and just as a movie in general, is a big disappointment. it's nothing but a rewarmed "sixth sense," and as long as that picture is still available, there is no reason on earth to pay money to see this turkey.lately, horror/slasher films such as the "final destination" series, "wrong turn," "boogie man," "the ring 2" and "the grudge," are becoming increasingly more reliant on big shocks with no payoff (for instance, something jumps out at the person on screen, elicits a gasp from the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something.) little goes into making it a genuine frightening experience like "the sixth sense," or "signs," or some of the classic horror movies of the 1940s, '50s and '60s."the messengers" relies upon the same old, tired clichés as these newer, far inferior films, and is therefor old, tired and - to my surprise - ended up as one of the most boring movies i have seen in awhile.the plot has another stupid family, led by dad roy (dylan mcdermott, "the practice"), mom denise (penelope ann miller, "awakenings," "kindergarten cop," tv series "desperate housewives"), big sis jess (kristen stewart, "zathura: a space adventure") and toddler ben (evan turner), who move to north dakota from chicago.the reason for the move is never really outlined here, but it has something to do with the dad's inability to find work and jess' drunken driving escapades. we know there will be trouble immediately because they move into a big gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a domicile that looks like the munster's summer home. oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there.jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but optimistic pop hopes to make a go out of raising sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering about). but when he meets burwell (john corbet, "raising helen" and looking like kevin costner in the film version of "my name is earl"), an itinerant drifter and expert on raising sunflowers, things start to pick up.but then weird things begin to happen; jess is terrorized by a violent unseen force in the house (of course, no one else but the two-year-old ben can see it, so she's labeled a flake) and the crows keep hanging around. ben also is able to detect the unearthly creatures, but since he's two, he cannot articulate it. scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally had me wanting to yell to the screen, "he can't tell you! he's two - freaking' - years old!" yes, have the only protagonist who can solve all of these things be a mute toddler is real smart. anyway, we're left to ponder the sanity of jess; when and if ben will ever properly describe the paranormal visions he sees; if dad will make the sunflower thing work; if the high plains drifter is a good guy or bad; what the point of the george plimpton-looking realtor is; how a pitchfork plunged in the back can only be a flesh wound; what mom's role in the family is; and where are all the crows coming from.all of this while waiting and wondering for something - anything - to happen. the conclusion is really lame, as well, and once again begs the question of how a spirit which has no physical body can cause harm to a living person. very dull, pointless and most terrible of all, not frightening in the least.oh, and there are a lot of crows in this movie.

******spoilers within******* what a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. the movie had no character development: i felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. the movie had so many clichéd bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies.the movie was so predictable. many times i would be saying to myself, "let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?" yup, i was right. even in the opening scene, i predicted that the "attack" on the family was by some man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). sure enough, that is what happened (of course, you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). and, of course, another "evil man" scenario. why was he evil and killing his family? because he's a man, duh!as someone else stated, this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age, or for a movie from the 1970's, but it is far from being a 'scary' movie by todays standards. and, like so many other crap horror movies, a lot of the scares were "fakes". scary music, scary music, scary music, and.....a crow suddenly flies at the window! wow, scary!how did the old bank guy manage, a few times, to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him? i thought, for sure, that the old man was a ghost. nope, just a crappy movie.i rated this movie a 2 out of 10, because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing.

after having problems in chicago, the solomon family moves to a remote north dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter jess (kristen stewart) and her 3-year-old brother ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.the messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. after reading the premise, i thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential. unfortunately, the film didn't live up to its potential although i should have expected this since the trailer was awful. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. the characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them.the directors did a horrible job at building up suspense. they mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. the music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. i also didn't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie. the house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area. also, i didn't like the close-ups of the actors. during a conversation, the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying. the directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish. however, since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a hollywood film.the acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in december, i'm sure it would have received several razzie nominations. kristen stewart showed some talent in panic room but you wouldn't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in the messengers. she was okay at acting scared and that's it. the rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. penelope anne miller was just awful when it came to everything. it sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions i have ever seen. dylan mcdermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. john corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes. the twins who played ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors. overall, this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it's blandness and lazy film-making. rating 4/10

i don't expect a lot from ghost stories, but i do expect a story to make a bit of sense! is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers? when the bad guy, all of the sudden, becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him, then i have a problem spending $9.00 for a ticket! alfred hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. didn't anyone learn anything in their college film 101 class? a good movie has at its roots an interesting story!here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: if you have desperate financial problems move from chicago to the middle of no-where in north dakota to grow sunflowers (i kid you not!). if your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town, which, at best, has a community hospital. hire a drifter to live & work with you, out of the blue, without checking any references, when you have a teenage vixen daughter, a wife and toddler. ( i'm glad they're not my parents!) a town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide, just outside of town. and, of course, blame the man's lunacy on a bad crop of sunflowers! (doesn't anything else grow in north dakota?) a couple of days after you buy your rundown house - with huge vines growing everywhere - that it reminds you of jack and the beanstalk, a guy from the x-files, ala smoking man, (i'm glad to see the cigarettes didn't get him, i guess he doesn't inhale!) will just suddenly sneak up on you while you're working to offer you the sale price of your home, plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason!i think you get the picture. i have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month, it just blows my mind! is it that difficult to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot? i'm glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains! i wish i could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash!

first off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. the first time i saw it i just said "well, mistakes happen" and brushed it off. after about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. if you haven't seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.now, about the film. this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid "ghost" story; however, the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely. you begin watching the movie under the assumption, alluded by the tv commercials, that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children; particularly young children, which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger. the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. **(spoiler)** the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an "unseen" force in the home. the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter, at the beginning of the movie, asks her little brother to tell her where "it" is right before "it" grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar. the young boy also witnesses this supposedly "unseen force" kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. after his family is killed, the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well.as i said, this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an "unseen force" with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a two-year-old. this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well; completely ruining the "only children can see" illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene.regardless of this, the movie didn't actually get "ruined" until the plot twist at the end. in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie. all of a sudden, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man snaps and tries to kill the mother, daughter, and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family; which he killed at the beginning.the whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf. first, why was the family's souls trapped in a house? if the director was going for a ju-on (the grudge) approach in which the family, after dying in a fit of rage, would haunt the house and kill whoever enters, why did the haunting stop after the father was "captured" by the ghosts of his family? if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them, why were they attacking the new family? here's another one for you. it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest. this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie, was living on the property for months. during all this time, why didn't the ghosts just go kill him? this movie included a lot of clichéd "horror movie" scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. however, i'm telling ya, this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end. it's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending. for this movie to have been a success, they should've stuck with the "only children can see them" premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning (would've opened the door for possible sequel,too).

just saw this movie on opening night. i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... i must say, i was not impressed. i'm so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.first of all "the messengers" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. it might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial. some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes.if you've seen previews for this movie, then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.

good old jess franco! the always-reliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle "adventure". let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage) actress katja bienert parade around topless. it's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert franco! and it wasn't even the first time, since the duo previously already made "linda" together. anyways, just in case you wondered: yes, "diamonds of the kilimanjaro" does have a plot, albeit a very imbecilic one. during the opening sequences a plane, carrying aboard a wealthy scottish guy and a girl child, crash amidst an african tribe of vegetarian cannibals. i say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh. the obnoxious scot declares himself the great white leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed white goddess. several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and  even more importantly - to steal some of the tribe's legendary diamonds. this could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie, but jess franco obviously couldn't be bothered. why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone's garden and there's a massive amount of clumsily edited national geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity. the back of the dvd describes "diamonds of the kilimanjaro" as an ingenious, feminist and adult orientated version of tarzan. yeah right, they just put that sentence there because katja bienert's character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times.

a group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to try and locate a lost heiress named diana, who disappeared years before in a plane crash, and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess.once again, my search for sleazy, european cannibal movies has taken me deep into jess franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub-par scriptwriting, crawling with crap camera-work, and abundant with awful acting (franco regular lina romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing, elderly woman). it is here, in this hellish place, that i finally stumbled upon diamonds of kilimanjaro, an abysmal jungle-based exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching it.tawdry and unrelentingly dull, even by franco's standards, this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level: the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of edgar rice burrough's tarzan, albeit with a feminine twist; the film appears to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens, although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in africa; and the death scenes are virtually bloodless (franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter, but despite initial appearances, this isn't a cannibal movie and it isn't that gory).where the director does succeed, however, is in his casting of sexy young katja bienert as jungle jail-bait diana. running and leaping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy loin-cloth, her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time, this nubile beauty makes quite an impression. franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of mari carmen nieto as treacherous traveller lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions), and aline mess as topless warrior woman noba, thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of 1/10 from me (although i'm sure he'll be receiving plenty more in the futurei have loads of his films yet to see).

jess franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history, and god bless him for it. unfortunately, the diamonds of kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards.exploitation films should be judged on story, sex, and gore. what else is there? this film fails on most of those benchmarks. the plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. we really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place. as expected, her father is the "big white chief" and she becomes a goddess, sitting in trees, naked. add fortune hunters and precious stones, and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line. the characters are stock, not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedings.gore? none, or at least very little. this film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic italian cannibal movies. those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way. save for one cheap be-heading, this movie features surprisingly little blood and guts.as best i can tell the only reason this movie exists is so katja bienert, aliene mess, and mari carmen neieto could run around naked. actually "lita" (mari carmen neieto) does the full frontal heavy lifting, while the two jungle ladies are bare chested throughout. yes, there are love scenes....probably the most sterile franco has ever supervised. the women are beautiful, but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either.this movie just reeks of low budget buffoonery. the sets are laughable. the acting is horrid, and the editing is confusing. there is no real story to hold this together, and not enough of a budget (or effort) to shock or titillate. i think franco fans have come to expect more out of the master of exploitation.

franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the "earlies" (often black and white and inventive), the "naughties" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving soledad miranda), the "nudies" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and "the rest".this is part of the "rest". it is not really a cannibal movie at all. it is certainly no gorefest. the few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all. the picture quality on the german dvd i watched is poor. the film peters out (insofar as it ever catches fire). as a franco fan, i would tell others not to bother. do something else with your time...read a book....get a copy of "women in cellblock 9"...anything really...

an expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous african jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named diana (luscious brunette looker katja biernet, clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body) who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the mabutos. director/screenwriter jess franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache. the lousy dubbing, excess amount of grainy "national geographic"-like animal stock footage, groovy, jazzy lounge score, terrible acting, talky, uneventful narrative, tepid soft-core sex scenes, and static photography don't help matters any as well. fortunately, there's plenty of tasty gratuitous nudity on sight to alleviate the tedium to a reasonable extent: besides the delectable biernert, both aline mess as fierce, wicked high priestess noba and mari carmen nieto as the conniving, treacherous lita are likewise real easy on the eyes. the beautiful jungle scenery is very nice, too. but overall this picture sizes up as barely watchable and hence instantly forgettable swill.

lord protector is kiddie fare, but for whose kids? obviously shot for television or stv, this amateurish rehash krull has several stock characters -- a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist -- on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet. badly written, acted and staged in available california locations like municipal parks and a ranch, lord protector has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time waster. jay underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five year olds, are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human. a no-name actor playing a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king lear. i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted-over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, like bert gordon's the magic sword. the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be. often, such cheap hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time, trying to figure which was which in this one. i didn't have much luck.

i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real pity, because i like these folks, i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this?!!!! this was crap from every possible angle. from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen! the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san fernando valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew.i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible? yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact, sleep well after it is released.life, what a trip!

i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.it's not even scary. it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this..."thing" to trick movie fans. i guess big producers make whatever they want.just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get "the nun".and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible!!!!

i can only say this: ee03128 from portugal, i couldn't say it better. the worst movie i've ever seen... and i've seen lots of crap! when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie. when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it. balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. and his scripts are not much better either. and, of course, in barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on vacations. please, be serious! and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors... there is something remarkable too. it is fair to recognize it. compared to the usual level, all the spanish actors use a fairly good english

the nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. it is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels. if you like senseless cookie cutter screamers, you'll like this, otherwise you should pass.

"the duke" is a film based in the heart of the british aristocracy where an old duke (john neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (oliver muirhead and sophie heyman); he passes his dukeship down to his dog. the dog's "best friend", an american girl named charlotte (played by courtnee draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former duke due to him being her great uncle. a young chef named florian arrives, with him and charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way, acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of hubert, the 'duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. all this is watched over by james doohan who plays a butler who is determined to try and serve his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master, hubert. doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. a fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor.though from the technical viewpoint, i dislike this film as i only watched upon discovering james doohan's role. though the plot is good, elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. ignoring the absurdity of a "doggie duke", i personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. the dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. the director, phillip spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. plus, the acting of muirhead and heyman, whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences, fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role.but, as a mature movie fan, i find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. i can admit i found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched, but has definite connections. i do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but i do highly recommend it to dog lovers, families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and james doohan fans who wish to see 'scotty' in his final role.

i had the misfortune of seeing this crapulous effort on television a few years ago. suffice it to say michael gross phones in his performance, and hasselhoff is the least convincing thief/psycho...ever! if you have a couple of hours to kill, watch it and prepare to laugh.

nothing special to see here, the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. this film has an original story, but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters, so in my opinion it's not worth seeing. i'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times. so if you are looking for something original see another thing.

sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim, well in this case it was. i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny, i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it.the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sex lives; dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before, ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object, tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman.the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to "i don't believe that anybody could write that" an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash, then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma. the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad... not that it was all that good either. surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic.i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film, i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates.

there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse! the dictionary definition of "puerile" should now read: "sex lives of the potato men"! unless, that is, you like dog poo and mucous; in which case - this is the film to see! johnny vegas et all - what were you thinking!

the daily mail's christopher tookey had some choice things to say about this film, among them "watch it all the way through its 82 miserable minutes, and i guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking: 'have we really descended to this?' yes, we have, for if ever a movie testified to the utter cynicism, tastelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make british movies, it is this abomination". tookey continues "aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear, filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk, this sex comedy is so sordid, unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex, and indeed films, for life", before concluding "sex lives of the potato men is not merely a truly vile film, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen". normally i don't listen too closely to the critics, but in this case, tookey was bang on the money. this film goes beyond bad, indeed, it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be 'saying tw*t in a brummie accent'. it's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the goodies, monty python, spitting image, not the nine o'clock news and fawlty towers.ideally, sex lives of the potato men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire vix spin-off the fat slags (2004) and the ill-starred all saints vehicle honest (2000) in the celluloid graveyard, but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided "best film ever!" raves from people who should know better, so i must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the british film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted onto an undeserving world. yes, i really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead, but i actually remember thinking "it can't be as bad as the critics said it was"...but, as god is my witness, it was worse.acting - dire from start to finish, special mention to mackenzie 'albert steptoe's legs on a young man's body' crook.soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee doin' the lambeth walk to a watered-down imitation of the specials knob-shiners madness on every single comedy / variety programme in the eighties...and 'ace of spades' by motorhead as the title music? what the hell...trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by the young ones, indeed, ever offered by any comedy show?! cheap shot, way below the belt.script - written by a 12 year old who's just read every single back issue of smut and zit in one long red bull-fuelled session...surely? c'mon, no real, proper, worldly, grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? and mark gatiss was in it...mark gatiss...the least annoying member of the league of gentlemen and goodies fan taking part in such a towering heap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? 'one of the brightest british comedy stars'? not any more he's not! on the subject of league of gentlemen, somebody give me a pair of lead-lined diver's boots and steve 'face like a collapsed rectum' pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before i die...please...cinema, british or otherwise, just doesn't come much worse than this. kent bateman's the headless eyes (1971) is a new-wave masterpiece compared to this repugnant smut.

i found myself watching sex lives of the potato men with a furrowed brow, puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a film so totally devoid of humour.poo and wanking jokes are funny when you're eleven. eighteen plus and you begin to lose friends around the water cooler.maybe some enjoyment could be had from this movie if you're the kind of person who frequently plays practical jokes involving dog mess, brown bags and matches, or maybe partake in 'man' competitions on nights-out by imbibing companions' vomit/urine etc when you're not back at your parent's basement punching your teenage wife.even then "sex lives..." it's hard to recommend. perhaps if you're really weirdly into masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings happy slapping the elderly or watching toilets flush, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of cinematic distribution.i'd discuss characterisation, narrative or performances had i not zoned completely out following the lengthy tuna-paste/vagina comparison.

i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. there is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? it has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a british comedy. it also has johnny vegas and mackenzie crook, marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.what it's principally lacking is charm. the characters are impossibly idiotic, unbelievable and alienating, so that instead of a film of men behaving badly the producers have made game on. any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of dozy, sexist british men would have got hold of a few copies of loaded, zoo or even viz to read sid the sexist and the thing would have written itself. instead, the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic, difficult to care about, characters. character comedy - as opposed to slapstick etc - only works if the audience can recognise some human truth to the situation. but watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you can't stop it.sadly, the film is also poorly made. the plot structure is weak, there's little character delineation or development, and many of the scenes aren't funny. time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes, pointlessly and gratingly. there's a lot of needless repetition - when you've done one joke about parking outside a sex party you don't need to do it again. one wonders what the uk film council saw in the script.this is a world where most men are rakes, and most women are continually up for it. the apartment and alfie satirised much the same world view, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. thus they've ended up with a kind of inferior update of confessions of a window cleaner. somebody british needs to have another go at this kind of thing, and do it properly  a good next project for simon pegg and edgar wright i think...

ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? this is one of those films. it was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. i caught it on tv last night and gave in to curiosity.in the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'carry on...' vein but with 'adult' language. indeed, it harks back to the 60s/70s uk porn industry, cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering (spot the nipple?) that whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography.it has the benefit of mackenzie crook (the office, pirates of the caribbean and much more) and also johnny vegas. the chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. beyond these unexpected positives, it does leave me wondering what happened to england. junk food, low paid work, council estates, desperate lives. as a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy birmingham. foreigners might find it informative about british attitudes and aspirations. overall, though, i still feel disbelief that i sat through it.

sex lives of the potato men is about the sex lives of several men involved in delivering potatoes. so there are no surprises there. it is, in fact, pretty much what you might expect from the title: that is, it's a quirky comedy involving sex and potato men. at times the film works. it's an edgy, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who are having problems of various sorts with women. where the film clearly does not work, and why it failed at the box office, is that the quirky, uncomfortable parts are perhaps just a shade too quirky and uncomfortable. instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife, i think most of us just kind of groan awkwardly and wonder what andy humphries was thinking. well, perhaps we are shown what he was thinking all too clearly.

sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that tweety bird happens to be on with his owner granny. oh i don't even have enough words to convey how much i disdain both the tweety and granny characters. they simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed. sylvester is a great character on his own, but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a granny. this animated short can be found on disc 4 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 and features an optional commentary by micheal barrier.my grade: d+

opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'kit for cat', 'tweety's s.o.s' fails to live up to that classic cartoon. instead, we get an example of friz freleng's tweety and sylvester series at its most generic. unlike chuck jones's road runner series, which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting, freleng's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'tweety's s.o.s', then, basically amounts to "this time let's put 'em on a boat". it's not an entirely weak cartoon. there are a few good jokes, mostly involving granny's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than tweety says "i tawt i taw a putty tat", a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns. 'tweety's s.o.s' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's definitely one to avoid.

i happened to catch this movie on late night tv. i saw the opening credits and thought this looks good. well i was very wrong. while not excruciatingly bad (it had some funny and tender moments)it lacked any sense of cohesion.it started off well enough with kathy bates'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. but kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think fried green tomatoes. the problem wasn't kathy, it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place. it was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next. the script also felt very contrived.some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release. the main reason i think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.having said all that i thought the small woman who played maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.

this movie was produced by the biggest producer in costa rica. although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in costa rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an oscar nomination due to it's political relevance with oil (-he he, right) ...well, this is all a lie. this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos salazar herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like subject) and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the atlantic coast of costa rica with an american oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region, but at the end it never was approved by the government. now, it may have some nice footage about the beaches, but that's it; nothing bigger than that... it is all in the camera. most of the actors are lousy, except for two or three. the rest lack of sense of what acting means: they overact most of the time. the story is completely common and cliché, worthy of a cheap mexican soap opera as i said.. because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil, but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. the script is nothing impressing, it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought. it has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes... but besides that is pretty decent. the director did an alright job, i mean, he is not like an oliver stone,but he did his job with the resources he had handy. i would like to question him why instead of using costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones.. i mean after all they bragged about being an 100% costarican production... that's what you at least expect. final the end is is not well done, there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless. besides being the most elaborated movie in all costarican history, i think it's mediocre. you can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash. never heard of "pi"? anyway, if you are curious about costa rican or central american movies, this one will do, but you are definitively not missing anything.

i have just seen caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual vistas film festival held here in dallas, and i must express my discontent. the opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of south american countries (costa rica, in this particular case) by north american oil companies, and the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. the main characters are a married couple who live a simple, pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. right away, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half-sister. i'm not going to go into specifics about this (and to be honest, i don't feel that i'm spoiling anything with this review), yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy. so, the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place, trying to preserve his livelihood. on one hand, the reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself). on the other hand, he is faced with being dead broke, but on the side of his community, protesting the drilling. given the length of this film, it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described, but it just doesn't happen, and i'll tell you why. you will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far, one for direction and an audience award. i'm not going to pick apart esteban's direction, it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything. the audience award was at a film festival in spain, and for it to gain an audience award, i'd have to imagine that spanish people just dig soap operas. in fact, central and south america dig soap operas as well, i know that much. i assume that esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that is what unfolds over the course of this film, so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side, almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome, because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. the only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. it's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. from time to time, they toy with the oil against community plot, but these are digressions at best. what we see a lot more of are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. these themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary. it's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance. nevertheless, the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself, resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for, or if there was ever anything to begin with. here are two things that i think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. it's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. or, perhaps if caribe had been an hour longer, they could have worked this all out. regardless, i'd have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and i think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. caribe is both and neither. these two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with, both sides suffer. best of all, the romance plot is never even resolved. i'd like to say i'd watch this movie again to see what i've missed, but i have a strong feeling that i already know what it is. as far as i'm concerned, it wouldn't matter if i saw caribe ten more times. i've missed it because it is simply not there.

this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that perrugorria have done. it looks like a commercial from beginning to end. the ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod, it doesn't have pace, rhythm. it's illogical. what a mess. you can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes, and the ending...wow------spoiler-------jesus christ, how the hell perrugorria got shot? are you serious? worst scene of someone getting shot ever!------end of spoiler-----bad directing, bad script, bad acting...really bad overall. i wouldn't recommend this movie at all. it's a waste of money and time.

i've read plenty of jane austen in my time and approve of several cinema/tv adaptations but this one we just don't need.rating is a 2 as i wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. dull script matched by even duller acting. i've heard billie piper is ok in dr who (not a fan so can't confirm) but in this she just sucks. there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. this is austen, it's supposed to be a romance!please don't let this put you off austen or historical dramas. there are plenty of better programmes to view.

mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere, at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. a pick-up truck pulls up & an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe (claudia christian) out & leaves her there, but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of nestor duvalier (brion james) watches her from a short distance. virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print, thigh high, high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness. nestor then rips her top open, turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards. virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix (art evans) & the lapd baffled, or at least that's the message a local tv news reporter named clay dwyer (mark thomas miller) is telling his viewers. clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice (mary beth mcdonough) & therefore his mother emily (jeanne bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing nestor. unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes, nestor then turns into a monster again & bites emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself. nestor takes emily out to train her, they find a suitable homeless bum (rory vansaint), murder him & eat his guts but emily's son clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!edited, written & directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film. looking at some of the other comments on the imdb & the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror. well i can tell you now that i didn't see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren't any, unless they are very subtle. the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents, that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the predictable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. there are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills (stella stevens)), slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? wrong, mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting emily, showing her how to hunt for food & clay finding out. until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace, had some ok special make-up effects & had me interested, unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emily's son, the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his mother & the fact that she's a flesh-eating monster. this part of the film is incredibly slow, boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role-reversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her, telling her off & putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins & ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped. technically mom is bland & cheap looking, although i can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time. the special make-up effect's on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes, blink & you'll miss them. don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was, the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. there isn't much gore either, a severed arm, some brief intestine eating, a burnt body & a drill in someone's arm is all we get. the acting is ok but please mr. brion james what is that dodgy accent all about!? at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings, everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night (1985) but you may recognise him from die hard 2 (1990), he made mom & die hard 2 in the same year?! talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film & it certainly isn't a comedy as far as i'm concerned. very poor, very disappointing & yet again i've been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. definitely one to avoid.

lame b-horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her. when said lodger is killed off, mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authorities.my main complaint is that this film should have brought the funny. it failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the b-movie crowd happy. i've seen worse but i wouldn't give this one a rec--4.5/10.

uncle fred olen ray once again gives us a little of his retromedia "goodness" in the form of this soft-core cinemax non-classic.a numb-nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a "black hole" as the intelligent dolts put it. pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time-line and she beds her way into the future. pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future.ray again delivers a passable (but barely) smut-fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin. yeah it's barely titillating but heh! if worse comes to worse it will cure you insomnia.s10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10

this is probably the most uninvolving film i've ever seen. i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon (everything else besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for wasabi) and jean reno. it's a testament to just how bad this film is that reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors (admittedly he's just starting out here) can't make this film, or the moments in which he is on screen, watchable.it's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. and, predictably, none of it is entertaining.it's not a "french mad max" as some people have claimed (actually, i think they mean "mad max 2") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. mad max 2 was pulsating, mad max 2 was exciting, mad max 2 was worth your time - le dernier combat is none of these.i know it's supposed to be cool to like arty black-and-white french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why i wouldn't trust anyone who claims to like le dernier combat, because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it asks for so much and gives nothing back. i found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. anyone who can sit through it undistracted isn't human, or, at the very most, is psychotic. (actually, they're probably just trying to seem "cool").

i rented this movie, after hearing chris gore saying something to the effect of "five stars!" on that attack of the show show. well when i turned around the dvd and it showed the 3 stages of hell, well i had to buy it. just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.i wasn't expecting ecw or czw for an hour and eighteen minutes, but i was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. well sadly there wasn't anything like that. the 3 stages of death part happens right from the beginning, and its pretty much downhill from there. nothing really happens in this documentary. it was pretty raw, bare and unbiased. not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this one. you'd expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he doesn't. which would of been nice to have, a message or reason for this doc.there was no real reason to have a narrator, there should of been just text explaining some of the less obvious scenes.it doesn't really explain the lives of these wrestlers either. it shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes, which sound interesting, but the reality isn't as great as it sounds. for instance mom watching her son wrestle with light bulbs and tacks, for the first time, at a public park. instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling, they show her reacting to the camera, instead of say a interview later on, or just actually witnessing her reactions.legitamit document wise, this one ain't. the source material was flimsy to begin with. nothing truly profound or interesting really happens. no conclusion to a few of the more interesting stories, no real point or final thought to backyard wrestling, edited together badly, and its and its basically a cheap, failed rip off of beyond the mat.wrestling wise, this is pretty boring. the better bumps are at the beginning, and slowly become less amazing and shocking. if you have seen japanese wrestling, indie wrestling, or even backyard wrestling dvds, than this wont shock and awe you. if you want wrestling don't make the same mistake i did and see this one. go get some czw ecw or xpw dvds instead.the only thing i got out of this documentary was how stupid people can be. not for supporting self mutilation or doing dangerous stunts, but their reasoning for committing these acts. the backyarders seem stupid for wrestling. most of them are jobless, and probably have a few issues in their head, and wrestling is a type of therapy for them. than the supporters seem even more idiotic. mothers basically take the whole "if ya cant beat em join em" reasoning to cope with the fact that their sons are basically killing themselves. school authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because its an alternative to joining gangs and to a lesser extend doing drugs, which is kinda funny since that segment took place in a rural town, where like people live 20 miles from one another. people are stupid. thats what i extracted from this documentary.if you want to see the reasoning and thoughts to someone brutalizing themselves in wrestling and basically what the back of this dvd promises, get unscarred: the life of nick mondo. its more amazing, and interesting than the backyard, and a lot more entertaining. oh and its actually good.

does anyone care about any of the characters in this film? - or for that matter what happens to them? - i doubt it. that is the key problem - for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at all.what may have worked in the 16th century, certainly does not work in one can only assume 'post apocalyptic liverpool' if that was indeed what it was meant to be. the problem is the characters in post apocalyptic liverpool, whilst still driving around in cars, using mobile phones and watching television, have reverted to speaking in shakespearian language - with a liverpudlian dialect. oh dear! bad enough you might think - but this often lapsed into pure scouse - with comments such as 'eh lah are you a cockney? and was that a merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? well the good news is that in post apocalyptic liverpool - the trains are still running.the characters without exception are badly drawn, wooden and more like charicatures on the lines of the joker/penguin in batman and robin except there is no real storyline to speak of - or if there is - it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and 'blade runnerish' and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal. costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes (parkers are big in post apocalyptic liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress party?the film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made at all.

every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense, anticipation and allure to the plot. this story falls completely flat in this area. there is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters, and so suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no allure at all.the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, i was quite surprised. during the movie, i expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.while i'm a fan of both actors, i do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or, perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries. the writing was very weak, which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly, the script could have used some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf.(sorry diane ladd and richard gere).

if you're a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you weep inside. granted, i'm only about 1/2 hour into it currently, but it's so painful, i felt it was my duty to warn away real ten commandments fans before they are subjected to this bastardization. i didn't think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in 1950s when the original was shot, but this 2006 remake proves me wrong. i can forgive some lame special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, melodramatic lifetime movie-style schlockiness, and the stilted we-are-wax-figures-come-to-life acting makes me hope they'll rewrite the plot and drown moses in the red sea.

i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. this movie is awful from the demille version. all the way through this movie i was saying to myself, huh??? - what???? - i don't remember that part. the only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the red sea. and in heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version. did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the red sea was being parted? i think i did. anyway, i might - might - watch the last part tonight.i wish hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies. instead of re-hashing old films.they should of left well enough alone.update:well i watched the last part. did moses make up the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand - or was i seeing things - please someone - email me and let me know. horrible

i realise it's very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a charleton heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. even the animated the prince of egypt was better.the one thing that threw me off was ramses. compared to yul brynner's version, paul rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-pharoh like. the acting really wasn't that great. for a modern adaptation, i was expecting something better. it just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one. i guess they were running on a tight budget or something. there's an occasional voice-over narrator which i found strange and unnecessary. it also broke up the flow of the story. and um...god's voice/lines were kinda weird.

this movie was dreadful. biblically very inaccurate. moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of egypt, the movie has him about forty. moses was about forty when he fled egypt, was gone for forty years, and was with them wandering for forty years. moses was 120 years old when he died, and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land. i realize movies use a lot of "poetic license" as the biblical account isn't that long, but, if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known, and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character, this movie fails in this aspect, and in many others.even though the 1956 version has its problems as well, theatrically it was much better.

i as a christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture. the film's website says they researched the movie before writing but i believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source the bible. i sat with two different versions of the bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. it was like they made up what was not in the bible and changed what was in the bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth. i personally am too young to remember the 1950's ten commandments but it can't be any worse than this. i have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty.

i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of moses and the exodus of israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon moses' shoulders. as excited as i was to see this film, i was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (i'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) what is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from biblical texts. one of the overarching principles from the bible is that *god* led his people out of egypt, and he promised that he would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey. not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. he never left them; he always was visible to the israelites. the movie, however, depicts a god who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert. this movie changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts god as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void.in addition, the depiction of moses was just as wrong. moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be such a father-figure to israel throughout the old and new testaments, even that moses is known as a man of great faith). however, the movie depicts him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure loner who despises the calling that god placed on his life. ok, i'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the exodus story... but this is beyond creativity -- it is heresy.

with a name like "10 commandments" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible, specifically exodus. not so here. this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark-made film. remember "noah"?? that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. at least this film had "some" truth to the original story. however, menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of moses, is not in the original story. other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated. so what, you may ask? because this should be representative of the actual story; otherwise, some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened. in today's age, people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible. also, it is a great error. see revelation 22:18-19. the script is already written. why change it? other than the account in exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have the cecil b. demille film to compare it to, which is clearly a far better presentation.the night it first aired, my wife was anxious to see it. i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark-film. she looked puzzled and said, "why? hallmark makes good movies". that might be so, but they butcher the bible. i'm sorry to say that i was correct. not just the story, but the acting as well. with today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie. i'm still waiting...

if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical (or torah) portrayal of the events in exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the bible have been "created" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a shepherd priest who gave moses excellent advise. god is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that moses had to figure things out for himself. nothing could be further from the truth.this movie is a typical humanistic twist on biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on moses for trying to understand what god wants and what he should do. those who know the book of exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie, but outright glaring changes to events. most importantly, they will see a near total absence of god's dialog with moses, which determines everything moses does after the burning bush. far from being alone as portrayed in the movie, moses is guided by god with detailed and direct communication.even hallmark apparently can't acknowledge god's direct role, and without his spoken words to moses many events make no sense. to compensate, hallmark has actually changed some things. for instance, after the golden calf god plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live. hallmark creates a civil war instead and the israelites pick sides, then slaughter each other. moses side wins of course.there may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. the twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their bible. read exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.

this movie deviated from the bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie. i hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally seen 10 commandments. moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind looking man charelston heston in the 1956 movie. i will not waste my time again watching this movie. they tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one at that). i'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but to each his own. also, it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, it probably took them 2 months to make this one. the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.

this movie is the final straw. as two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy, this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since love actually. there was nothing good about the film whatsoever. it was an affront to love, death and everything in between. including horses and beaches. there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. this movie took the spark out of nicholas sparks. diane lane cannot act to save her life. she was unconvincing in her laugh, cry, and dance. and she needs a better haircut. there is no reason to watch this movie. save yourself. the romantic comedy is officially dead.

we thought this was one of the worst movies ever. i had to volunteer to watch the end. the romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the adams family goes on vacation...just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and the outerbanks does not look typically like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. also..it was not realistic. hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatches.also the friend was superfluous; and did not match the story what did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway? i also have to mention the wardrobe...did d. lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/shawl on in every scene? it was overdone. she looked good enough to not have to hide things; without making them obvious like with light slacks.lastly i am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid, and i mean stupid movie!!!! don't fall for the hype on this one!!!!!! we did. not even watchable.

*warning: 1 tiny inconsequential spoiler* you're right. this was no bridges of madison county. as soon as the lonely woman and richard gere checked into the big empty hotel, it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen. the question is: how will it come about? the answer is some stupid connect-the-dots story not worth sitting through. in one supposed bonding experience, they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans.(that was my spoiler.) and the next day they put them back. lol it wasn't compelling at all. i'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with richard gere. lol . . . it did have that advantage. you walk away and go, oh brother . . . even i could have written something more believable than that. i guess my life isn't quite as dull as i thought it was if i can scoff at a romance with richard gere. lol! and that friend inherited that totally contemporary, probably computer-generated mansion, resting half in the ocean, from her grandmother who built it after the civil war??? maybe her grandmother is oprah and this was way after the civil war? and yes, where was the email? what alternative universe do these people live in? i never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email, and facebook,and texting. and ok, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone, but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first.

not quite a bomb? the only thing missing was the enriched uranium. actually the script "may" have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors, but the dramatics of an aging diane lane acting as if she was a teenager (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach. every time she (adrienne) would jump into the arms of richard gere and then pull both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking, "oh, my aching back...this babe sure doesn't weight 125 lbs. anymore!" anyway, both characters were distinctly unlikeable, especially richard gere's: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (dr. paul flanner) that was on some kind of "soul quest" after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. dr. flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets up with adrienne. she is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental. of course, that's where dr. flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling madly in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon). in between romantic interludes and a nauseating song/dance routine that lane (adrienne) performs while listening to an old lp (no cd's?), they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up. dr. flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (naturally dr. flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous, distracting boy.) to make a long (predictable) story short, adrienne helps dr. flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a "routine" cyst removal of the face). dr. flanner is finally able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by scott glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. "i told him she was too old for that much juice!" glenn's character,(robert torrelson) appears to accept dr. flanner's apology. it's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. ever more circumspect, dr. flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. unfortunately, that means he must temporarily bid adieu to adrienne. of course, while entertaining the natives in timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. evidently, apologizing to robert torrelson for his wife's death was the second hardest thing. in the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been...hopefully no more gere/lane sequels!

i had high hopes for this film, even though i had not read the book. richard gere and diane lane together--should be good already. but the film does not deliver on the promise. i kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't. i have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love. that can happen. but we never really get to know the characters. i would have liked more focus on them. the film reminded me in places of bridges of madison county, and that film was far better. i really felt for the characters in that film, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between clint eastwood and meryl streep that there wasn't between gere and lane. each of them are very good actors in his or her own right. simply not the right movie for them together.

lonely, disconnected, middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future. at some sort of bed and breakfast by (well, literally in the sea) the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she subs for the owner. enter lonely, arrogant richard gere. he is a plastic surgeon. he is the only guest at the inn in the sea. diane lane is the lonely housewife. you'll never guess these two fall immediately in love. a tropical storm makes them true lovers.the subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense. the locations, photography are fine. gere remains one of the most over-rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint. ms. lane must've needed the money, but phones in her part with grace.

as an avid fan of christian film, and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for improvements in the realm of christian film-making, i was excited to get a chance to see this film. i was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. i was left disappointed.the beginning scene is excellent, though a slight rip-off of leon - the professional on the angle, it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings... everything after that was pretty much downhill.i was barely able to sit through this one, i was tempted multiple times just to shut it off.the acting, while quite possibly sincere, was incredibly awful. but then again, the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself. the dialog was worse than anything i have ever seen, and even my amateurish screenplay "the awakening" (soon to be an independent film) looked like a hitchcock-thriller next to this. (which isn't saying much.) the bright side of this film is that it was filmed on sony's brand new high-definition 900 cameras shooting in 24p. this film and star wars: attack of the clones were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year. unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting, poor angles, and awkward handling.the only good feeling i got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it. ; ) 4/10

while i am not a woman, i can enjoy a chick flick if its good. this one however is beyond bad. you have the by the book story, girl is getting divorced, boy with issues shows up. boom magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purpose.now while i can believe that kind of thing might happen, i am not an idiot. it wouldn't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy-pumpy, it would take time. yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen, i suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel... but most people don't.now, if that isn't enough... the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry... well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed... so how could they hit you again? why i know, lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye.... and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice (completely unreal, but who cares).so there you have it... girl find boy, boy find love, death finds boy and mom cries.... what a movie - not.

...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. i've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that i have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with "gone" isn't happy with what i had to say. so, i've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: ""gone" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words. horrible, stilted dialogue, a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water, acting that would embarrass the most self-centered of community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the "survivor" school of swooping crane shots followed by static, nostril-exploring close-ups, terrible adr work, special visual effects that aren't, pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion, terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades, no art direction to speak of---the litany of badness just goes on and on...i felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it...time that could have been better spent staring at a wall...under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this "movie," because long before it's over, they will be wishing they had been "raptured" before they made that mistake." case closed. amen.

i'm a christian, and i have watched pretty of christian movies, but this one is too bad. they try to make this good, but it's too hard for them i think.- you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - you can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. i think there will be a lot more of them.- the quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. the story is not so very bad, but could've been better. the only plus i give, is to the story in this film, but totally i can't rate it more than 3/10. watch "left behind" instead!

one of the reviewers here wrote: "good acting, good special effects, greatlocation. even better ending. " all i can say is, "ugh." this movie was painful to watch. let me start by saying this: i am a christian- considered extremely conservative by many people i know. so, what i am about to say is not biased by the"christian content" of the film. i'm not gonna bash it because it's christian. i am gonna give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. the writing is bad- over the top, way too preachy, and much of the "preachy" stuff is just plain irrelevant to the story. it just makes for bad scriptwriting. whether i agree with thescreenwriter's beliefs is irrelevant- make a good script that flows well, stays on track, and is believable. the acting was amateurish at best. but hey, when you cast amateurs, you getamateur performances. dirk been may have been on "survivor," but that showrequires zero acting ability. playing on his name and reputation to sell units is in bad taste. cast unknowns who can act and you'll have a much better film. the effects were horrible. the scene with the hail and the subsequent falling of the stars was embarrassing to watch. and what was so great about the ending? it made no sense.yeah, i know whattim chey was going for, but it missed the mark, big-time. i bought this film and expected so much more based on reviews and themisinformation on their website. and, although i was hoping for more, i got what i always get when i watch "christian" films- an under budget, poorly written, pathetically acted, badly produced piece of ka-ka. maybe someday, someone will finally step up to the plate with an end-times film as well-written and as well-made as gibson's "passion..." was. 2/10 stars.

the relationship between the lone ranger and tonto was always good for a snicker, but to take the joke out of the joke by building a movie around the gay appeal of the legend... oh the horror, the horror...

i waited quite awhile till i was able to watch this lone ranger movie. i finally got to see it on the lone star channel today and was very disappointed in the whole movie. clayton moore and john hart acted better lone rangers and jay silverheels as tonto, than the two stars in this movie. very poor acting was done by everyone in this movie. even the plot was bad and far fetching. i believe the horse, portraying silver was the best actor throughout this movie.i am glad i didn't go out and buy a copy of this movie when it first came out, as i feel it's a waste of good money. i am truly sorry the characters that clayton moore, john hart and jay silverheels played, and brought to life on the silver screen, have been tarnished so badly. unless in the future, they find actors worthy of portraying the characters in the same manner which clayton, john and jay did so well in the past, i'll not spend the money to buy the movie. i'll not watch this movie again.wayne davies

whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. the lone ranger is not camp, but "the" icon for good-doers all over the world. and it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real lone ranger, mr. clayton moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, i had the honor of meeting mr. clayton moore in columbus ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over mr. moore's treatment. needless to say, mr. moore's character, integrity and presence far outshined the movie.some things cannot be done better. there is only one lone ranger.

i loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station. i bought it and i couldn't wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid, and then as i saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... why in the world did i like this film as a kid, watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible. the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it!!! the costumes are perfect,good actors, there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful, and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive, the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like merle haggerd, and the statler brothers and those songs like "the man in the mask" are so bad that they are funny. this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline, and one of the best western plots ever, and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to health,after he and his fellow rangers are ambushed.its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger,as he concels his identity, and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with. but unfortunatly,as good as the storyline is, its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happen(for the love of god why did they do that?) between merle haggard's narration and the statler brothers singing corny(stupid) songs like "ride little cowboy" being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious. i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re-do this film right,because at the heart of this silly film is a great western.---i would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing. i give it 4 stars out of 10 --if your 12 years old, and dont know better, then you might love it.

i guess it wasn't entirely the filmmaker's fault though. the film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision to tell clayton moore (who had done the role in the 1950's and was the lone ranger us old folks grew up with) he couldn't wear the mask in public. now mind you, the poor guy wasn't making all that much money doing so, and it wasn't like he was going to take anything away from this film, but the whole thing seemed... gratuitous.the other thing the film suffered from (besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to overdub it) was that fact that westerns weren't so hip in 1981. john wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decade-long major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on genocide of the native americans. (that and blazing saddles sent up the whole genre! the campfire scene. enough said!) hollywood shied away from westerns, because science fiction was cool then.the one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken president grant (and seriously, i'd have let grant stay with the bad guys. the country would have been better off!) grant asks tonto what his reward should be "honor your treaties with my people". yeah, right, like that was going to happen!

there are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. let's start with the silly and annoying songs. like "ride little cowboy" which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of klinton spilsbury. the silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.i had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and i saw klinton spilsbury interviewed on various tv shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice. his body language was not exactly what people remembered who were fans of clayton moore and the lone ranger tv series. spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking trash about clayton moore after the producers got an injunction prohibiting moore from appearing at conventions and other events as the original lone ranger. clayton moore was not even allowed to sign as "clayton moore, the lone ranger." he could only sign as "the masked man." the incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was only added to by the petulant attitude of spilsbury who was very quick to tell reporters that clayton moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out! sadly, even after the movie was a total flop, the company that owned the lone ranger refused to lift their injunction against clayton moore, and he was never again permitted to sign anything except as "the masked man" and he could not don his black mask at any public appearances. between spilsbury's diva personality and the negative publicity the movie got, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. worse yet, a few weeks before the movie was finally released, the news was leaked that spilsbury's voice in the movie had been over-dubbed by james keech because the producers thought that spilsbury did not sound very convincing as a cowboy. the ridicule and derision that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail into the coffin.but then there was merle haggard narrating his way through the movie. apparently, the producers were hoping that the macho image of haggard (one of the outlaws of country music) would add credibility to spilsbury as the lone ranger. the narration by merle haggard was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with. at times haggard rhymes his narration, and it sounds like some weird kiddie movie. combine the rhyming narration with the "ride little cowboy" songs and any credibility that spilsbury could have mustered was destroyed by haggard and the soundtrack.tonto was played by michael horse, and as others have pointed out, horse had a lot more personality than spilsbury. in fact, perhaps because of spilsbury's allegedly combative attitude during filming, it seems like horse was given a lot more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected of tonto. tonto takes charge and often is the leader instead of the lone ranger. i was expecting (or hoping) that billy jack would make a cameo as tonto's brother (it would have made the movie a lot better). horse is not only more interesting than spilsbury, but he says more and has better scenes. perhaps it was a case of horse stealing the show from spilsbury. however, since the movie was so wretched, horse did not get much recognition. unlike spilsbury, horse has had a very productive career in the film industry.perhaps the last negative about this movie is the powder blue outfit of the lone ranger. the material that was chosen for spilsbury was more powdery blue than what clayton moore normally wore at appearances. that choice of color for the outfit just made spilsbury look more effeminate in his role. the comic book version had shown the lone ranger also wearing a red shirt and black pants, and that alternative outfit would have helped spilsbury look more convincing as the lone ranger.the supporting cast mostly mailed in their performances. they all look as if they were working on a tv episode and nobody seemed very convincing. even the villain, cavendish lost his edge due to the people around him. overall, i feel sorry for spilsbury. not only did he do a terrible acting job, but it is obvious that the production and publicity were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had. even if he had been an excellent replacement for clayton moore, i doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors. as it stands, this film is funny in a sad way.

i remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. at first it sounded like a great idea. a retelling of an american classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. there was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original "lone ranger", clayton moore. the movie studio had threatened legal action if moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (moore was performing at children's hospitals as the lone ranger for sick kids.) to many americans clayton moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger. i had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and legacy of the lone ranger if moore had been treated better. maybe even a cameo in the new movie. how ever this was not the case, and many of the viewing public stayed away in droves. also the story and acting were weak. all this added up to a big box office bomb, and rightly so. i personally i'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real lone ranger was treated. you don't treat an american icon that way.

this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen.casting: richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. supporting cast not too memorable.story: the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. the story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive. not destined to be a great one to remember.

i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the producers' court order against clayton moore using the name "lone ranger" or donning his black mask at personal appearances. quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality, this was the absolute height of nearsighted arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their attorneys. and i suspect that the lesson was well-learned after this film tanked, which was widely perceived as some sort of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against moore.in more recent times it has become the custom, when reviving a legendary film or tv project, to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances, and rightly so. show some respect, you idiots! and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect, which has happened, at least the offer was made. this is proof positive that film producers, studio executives, and entertainment attorneys are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.

this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades. i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything. revenge, love, justice? not in this guy's portrayal.there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr. if the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality. ewww.the dialogue is predictable and boring.the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like. i cannot believe the director would agree to this. it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed.hey, at least the horses and locations looked good, maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director.rating-2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is.

the untold origin of the lone ranger. it shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger.legendary bomb. the idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the lone ranger for 1980s audiences. right off the bat though there were problems. the studio ordered clayton moore (the original ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the lone ranger. it led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. i know of people who refused to see the film because of how moore was treated. also they hired the awesomely untalented klinton spilsbury to play the ranger. spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act. in fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor! also his off screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people up) didn't help matters. acting aside, the script is dull and slow. also the ranger himself doesn't show up until an hour in! there were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a pg. however i don't think it was that bad.there are a few (very few) things done right here--the photography was truly beautiful; michael horse was excellent as tonto; christopher lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the lone ranger finally shows up (with the william tell overture booming from the soundtrack) it's really rousing. but, all in all, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the lone ranger. it's easy to see why this bombed. a 4--mostly for the photography.

this movie totally sucked!!! don't even rent it! you'll hate it! the plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? if that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! i very much disliked this movie(hate is such a strong word!). and penguins cant fly! even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. i am not who you think i am!

would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? my eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. my ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. it's formulaic every step of the way. talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the "dreams can come true" schtick? show some more faith in the children's intelligence please. next to rock-a-doodle, this is one of bluth's worst.

whoa. i mean, whoa. i mean, whoa whoa.i saw this movie, waaay back when i was eight, in 1996. back then, cgi films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. also, back then we listened to things called cd players. but i digress. i used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, i've held reaally fond memories of it. hey, it's don bluth! anyone who hates "all dogs go to heaven" is clearly a robot. but, again, i digress.then, i saw it again. this really isn't one of his best, i can say now, eleven years later. i've seen a lot more films, and i've garnered a little bit more knowledge. now, sure, the voice acting is good, i'll give 'em that. story's...okay. i mean, we see it all the time. a lot. but, it works. the musical numbers are what irk me. this would've been more at home in the eighties, with these kind of musical numbers. in '96, most kids movies had epic numbers, like the lion king (which came out a year or so previous, but whatever)or stuff like that. you get showtunes here, vaudeville style.the animation kind of hurts, too. at times choppy, and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot, it's really hard not to notice.i still like "all dogs go to heaven, but this could've been waaay better.4/10

i rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995. after rewatching it again,my idea about it hasn't changed much.i was an adult then and i'm still an adult now!lolthe illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me. this isn't a documentary,it's a fantasy story where animals can talk!while i didn't care for much of the songs,i liked the one at the end of the picture where it's sang by barry manilow and another person.some people seem to make an excuse for it's primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn't used often in animated features but let's not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it!!but i think it's pretty fair to say that the pebble and the pingoin was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn't....the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous(mostly) underwater chase scenes.i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story. but most of the time,the story dragged on and was boring.worth a look if you like animation but if you're an adult and not a risk taker,go get another walt disney production instead of this!

i'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when i saw this movie in a $5 bin i figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. while i never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.the premise has enough potential. a penguin named hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea. he then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home. that set up isn't great but it's enough to set up what could be a fun adventure. unfortunately the duo's exploits never really amount to much and it all gets pretty repetitive. most of the situations they find themselves in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity...and the bonding the two of them under go is cheesy and forced.animation is good but not up to don bluth's usual standards. this is the guy that gave us the secret of nimh, land before time and an american tale, all of which had an attention to detail that often surpassed disney, the granddaddy of feature animation. this one doesn't amount to much beyond high end tv fair.the music is alright but pretty forgettable and the voice actors are all wasted talent...martin short is particularly wasted here as the lead character who in spite of being spoken of as a bumbler is practically a straight man through the whole film.in short the movie will probably appeal to very small kids but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it doesn't got what it takes.

hubie -- like stanely the troll from bluth's a troll in central park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. we're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.his character design is unappealing. the top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.and penguins should not have teeth. i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, gilbert gottfried. hubie, with his weenie little voice (provided by martin short), looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak.tim curry, who is usually delightful at being evil, does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain (might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice, not the supposedly menacing main villain).the entire plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for female penguin marina, who is just as dull as both of her suitors.worst of all is the pacing. we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more - this time in dialogue, this time in song...barry manilow may be a great songwriter, but in animated films like this and thumbelina, his songs feel limp and listless - especially the ballads. the only song i liked was the 1930's-ish "good ship misery" song.i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes, and that could have caused some of the problems - though i suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it ;).

here in australia nights in rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the notebook. quite frankly what a lot of rot.this film is a like a recipe. on paper we have all the right ingredients... richard gere normally perfect in this genre, diane lane an old favourite from "under tuscan sun" and "unfaithful", ocean side location, solitude and yet the movie sucks. at the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left! the main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place. and perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that gere and lane's characters bring to the movie. there's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see... romance! there's no warmth from gere's character, lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out. so as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters.others here say the book is great. well be it the screenplay, direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie. it's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place.very disappointing... save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate.

frankly, after cotton club and unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film, because it is bad. the acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere. it was well shot, but, then again, it is a big budget movie. it was too predictable, even for a chick flick. i even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end, the only thing i didn't know was how. too politically correct. very disappointing. the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. but, if you want that, watch national geographic. i love lane, but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy. as far as gere goes, he's a good actor, but he had movies like this, so i'm not surprised. an hour and a half i wish i could bring back.

richard gere and diane lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending i get really angry about...lets just say its not my cup of tea, just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.the plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with. he goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. this is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief. i wouldn't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable. why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? it really ruined it for me.if you like romance give it a shot, though wait for cable.

my husband brought this home from the video store, so i could watch something while stuck home sick. the sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book, but a sorta silly, light, romantic flick sounds just right (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). well, he meant well.my first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house must be fake...it's not only isolated alone on the beach, but set on moorings into the loose sand, and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! this looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country, in the fall), so potentially disastrous that i was sure filmmakers had simply cgi'd the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute b&b into the surf).but i have to tell you guys, thanks to "teh interwebs", i can say that the house, "serendipity" is very real, is indeed near rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs, appears mostly as it does in the film. you can rent it yourself, off season, for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! go for it! but...interestingly, the house has severe problems. the second thing that struck me after "would be washed away" was "what about the plumbing/electrical? in that surf?", and sure enough, "serendipity" was condemned for a break in the sanitation, caused by overwash from the ocean. (they are rebuilding.)and the house isn't from the "civil war". not to mention that viola davis, playing "cliché black best friend" (thankless role for a fine actress, last seen in "doubt"), is not remotely old enough that her grandmother could have built anything in the civil war! hello! that was 150 years ago! try great-great-great! (in reality, "serendipity" was built in 1988, laughably recently.) the basic film is built on a typical nicholas sparks weeper, which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance. it is also aimed in a very pandering way towards "women" -- you know, us women who love b&bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks...who dream of romance and guys who look like richard gere and dancing in the moonlight. don't give us plot, or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!gere plays a plastic surgeon, who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. of course, she died of an overdose of anesthesia, so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! hello! where is that guy? why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and is staying at the remote b&b...who should be there, why the only other person in the inn...diane lane! she's a lonely divorcée, with rotten kids, and an ex-hubby who wants her back. while she's trying to decide about that, the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the b&b.now, in the real world, if this set up ever even happened, the doctor would look like ernest borgnine...and the lonely divorcée, like rosie o'donnell. he'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. but this isn't the real world; i digress.the couple confess all, fall in love, a hurricane hits...they make love, fall in love, he has to go away, he dies and she cries a lot about that. the end.there, i've saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands, sons, boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe. very wearying.someone else asked why diane lane, a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she's 45ish and not over-the-top, so she isn't threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls. this would make sense if she was chubby, but she isn't.anyways, someone throw a pretty, paisley shawl over this film. so we don't have to watch it. conclusion: read a book, unless you are too sick. if too sick, go to sleep.

if you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like i was. the book was great and i was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well, however i felt like i was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. the movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense. i think both diane lane and richard gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. the book was true love story and i think this movie could of been a lot better.

i would like to make it very clear that i am not at all religious. i am an atheist but i could see that richard dorkins was contradicting himself over and over again. i would also like to make it known that i am not the sort of person that argues against something with philosophy all the time, but i feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question the belief in main stream science as well as questioning religious beliefs.i wonder if richard dorkins ever spends any time to think philosophically about belief, anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realise that science is indeed a religion in itself. yes there is a fundamental difference between the way that scientific beliefs are held when compared with other religions, but at it's roots, it's faith in a particular human instinct.throughout this series, richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence for it is strong enough. if you dig deep enough into how science functions you'll realise that it is just as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end, faith in the evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our senses but more than anything else faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence.this is not easy to explain but think about how the laws of physics were decided, it was because they were and still are the most common patterns of recurrence that we are aware of. i think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or place of existence the more we just assume out of blind faith that it is more likely to stay like it. for example, we don't expect that gravity will suddenly work in reverse tomorrow, by this i mean pushing matter away as supposed to attracting it. but the only reason why we don't expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware. however that doesn't mean that it couldn't do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even right now. it doesn't matter how long something may stay in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it but we do out of instinct. i would ask you to consider what is a long and short amount of time? there is no such thing, i don't know exactly how long it took for these supposed wise men to decide that everything must be made out of matter, sound, light, etc but lets give them what they would consider to be an edge way! lets say far longer than it really was 12,00000000000 years! is that a long period of time? 99999999999999999 years makes 12,00000000000 years seem like an incredibly short period of time. for all we know there could be an extreme amount of change in the so called laws of science within the next trillion years. it's all about comparison, only when we compare things can we say "that is long" or that is short. it's the same with big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others.i doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense. i certainly don't see why it should, but that doesn't mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it. with this in mind, the most hypocritical comment that richard dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational, "a process of non thinking" he said. if what we have in this instinct that i've been describing and this instinct that we all possess on some level isn't faith then i don't know what the hell it is. other times when he is being hypocritical is when he talks about the religions being bronze age, "bronze age myths" he says. i would like to point out that no matter how much scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience, experiments and evaluating, the pure rules of science are getting older and older all the time! they could even be described as the holy bible of science. he was going on about how he is sick of the different religions being stubborn " i am right, he is wrong" but looking back on how rude he was to the various interviewees, he seems to be just as stubborn him self. to be fair to him, at least he doesn't try to bomb religious communities. i appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war, but i don't respect his arrogance in his own beliefs.as far as i'm concerned, richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way. i am scientifically minded as well, but i don't think he has the right to go up to religious leaders having unfriendly arguments, trying to force his opinion on to them and virtually describing them as stupid. despite all his education, experience and discoveries he seems to fail to have the wisdom to properly question his very own system of belief. i have read what he says in defence of this argument that open minded atheists such as my self put forward, what he states suggests to me that he is totally missing the point.finally the title of the documentary, root of all evil. this states that religion is the root of all evil, it isn't true. there are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion.all round the documentary series was frustrating, narrow minded, hypocritical and flat-out rubbish.

i have watched the root of all evil with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . i don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.he is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in godhe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do god. one has only to look at the language used in his postulations. regarding faith. this commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. just think about it. when he gets in an electrician be believes that it will be wired correctly and trustfully turns on the switch. when he gets in a plumber he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. regarding faith in science when i was in chemistry class i believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons both of which have now been discounted. i was taught this as the atomic theory 'writ in stone' so to speak. so why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? dawkins states that religion will be the downfall of civilisation. religion is civilisation. can he, or any other atheist, please tell us what civilisation was founded and nurtured by atheism, barbarism or savagery please? he is now living in the last stages of a christian based civilisation and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source. i found dawkins to be arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, an obvious believer in eugenics and a nazi in his attitude towards the young. how dare he say what a parent can teach their child. the child is theirs, not the nation's and as the parents bequeath to it their genetics, so do they bequeath their beliefs. his dismissal of adam as "he never existed" as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude. so i have no proof that joe blogs lives in new york but he well may do. i just haven't found the proof yet. that does not negate his existence i note his argument with the bishop of oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the bible. well, dawkins also does this. where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement? he is also selective. i heard the lot when dawkins came up with the altruistic gene. what a hoot. he is desperately looking for proof for his wackiness and as the piltdown man was invented, so now we have this so called altruistic gene which predisposes us to looking after our young and other members of our 'group' the trouble is that all animals do this - not just apes, and with evolution it is survival of the fittest. not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race he is not reading the same newspapers as i am i found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that as we only have this life, we should enjoy it to the full. so how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well off european to a destitute person in africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving. will he help her? i note that all his opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. well g k chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b) we are against using contraception and abortion and homosexuality. all sins against the 6th commandment. funny that.as a catholic i find his dismissal of pius xii's pronouncement of the dogma of the assumption in 1958 to be erroneous. he , pius, never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself. in case dawkins does not know it, revelation ended with the last apostle. pius would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this pronouncement. also as a catholic i find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied. what utter rubbish. we, everyday fight the world, the flesh and the devil. we are the church militant. we are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in god. the trouble with dawkins was that he interviewed whacky zealots and extrapolated them to all of us.

i'm sorry but i just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. it's stereotypical and real homeschoolers are nothing like they were on this show!! personally i'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. i mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. if anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then i honestly feel sorry for them. this reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of homeschooled kids in "mean girls". it's sad, really, that people think this way. this is complete garbage, imho.

this proves just how awful the wb network was in the last few years of its existence. as a homeschooler, i of course deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes about the kids being "weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super-cool high school students". sorry tv writers, the world as viewed from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show)is not the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality. as for those who actually liked this show...please, dear sweet jesus please rethink the statement that you actually liked this crap over a very long walk. the acting is even more hollow, phony and wooden than the stereotypes the whole show was built around. thank you wb for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its beginning-to-end misery. this show never, ever should've even had the privilege of being made, no less having so much as eight awful episodes. i really hope that these actors eventually got a clue and stopped playing roles in garbage tv shows like this as soon as this show ended.

i haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western. or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. nothing could be farther from the truth! this movie is one huge non-sequitur! it is an affront to the noble b western films of the '30's. i have seen many of wayne's early lone star and republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.the bad guy is known as the shadow - for crying out loud! initially, the shadow's scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches. simultaneously, his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory. then they decide to move on to bank robbery. to do this, they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun - no explanation of why that's necessary or how he got that neato little toy!no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here. the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes. he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wall-safe. (knock-knock, who's there?) he is apparently clairvoyant, because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - presto - he's there. (i can just imagine that he has met them face-to-face and says,"i have some secret, nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed - meet me at the wall-safe and i'll give 'em to you.") just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is, like most of the elements of this mess, never explained.he has a nifty tunnel to the ol' hollow stump across the street from which vantage point, various of his baddies perform assassinations. he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe, but out in the main room.when not behind the safe, he hangs out on his cow-less ranch, masquerading as rancher matlock. we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch - two brothers - and assumed the identity of one. the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930's nyc (judging by her wardrobe), and she apparently never met her real uncle, because he dupes her, too!if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats, you need to see this movie. here, the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white head-bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired! it's like a game of pick-up basketball - only wayne has them tying bandanas 'round their heads instead of just taking off their shirts.perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending. immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife (the erst-while niece) on the front porch of their home. (never mind that there has been scant romance.) there, yak is playing with wayne's 3-4 year old son, dressed up in injun garb! (hiyoo, skookum fun!)no thanks to this nonsense, wayne went on to become a screen legend. only a super-star (packer or not!) could surmount this entry in a film resume. long live the duke!

the star packer is one of about 152,000,000 westerns that john wayne acted in during the 1930s. well, the number is a bit exaggerated, but it seemed almost like this many. this is because these b-movies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second, or lesser, feature in a theater. most bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep down costs and the star packer is no exception. to save on costs, incidental music is not used, running times were kept to under an hour, the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talents--and wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time. some of these wayne features are pretty good, while others, like this one, are watchable but also rather silly and inconsequential. i enjoyed this film and most of the others, but it's probably because i cut bs a lot of slack.wayne stars as john travers--a us marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage. this is odd, as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it, as they used telephones and modern machine guns--things you just wouldn't expect to find in the old west. such anachronisms are actually pretty common in b westerns--as gene autry films (for example) abound with them. wayne's sidekick is yak--played by stuntman and real life friend of wayne, yakima canutt.the bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as "the shadow" and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face! this sounds exactly like a character from a movie serial--the sort of baddie that kids loved but grownups groaned at because they were so silly and at bit like blofeld or dr. evil! the problem is, if you listen to his voice and pay any attention at all, it becomes obvious early in the film that this "shadow" is george hayes. now speaking of hayes, this is the same guy who later in films was known as gabby hayes, but here and in several other of wayne's early films, he looks and acts nothing like gabby. in the star packer, he was well dressed, articulate and clean-shaven--imagine that! in real life, apparently this was more the real george hayes--though i doubt that he was evil! now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film. you are left with acting (passable and nothing more) and stunts--which were actually pretty amazing. again and again, one amazing stunt after another occurred--such as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenes--all done, by the way, by canutt and his friends. canutt was often john wayne's double in films--and this went on for decades. the problem with some of the stunts, however, is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great "stumbling horses" bits seen later in the film. up until about 1940, film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop! in the process, the horses' legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized! one of the worst examples of this was the film jesse james--where several horses were brutally killed--leading to the american humane association insisting that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to certify that animals are not hurt in the production. so, since about 1940, films bear this little disclaimer. the star packer was made well before the disclaimer and i can't see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed.overall, this is at best a time-passer due to a poor plot, occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses. i am no bleeding heart, but just can't understand this disregard for a poor old animal.

sad to say this is one of the sillier of john wayne's series of poverty row westerns for lone star productions. here he is a united states marshal on the trail of a bandit known only, i kid you not, as the shadow.no it's not lamont cranston, it's some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don't see who he is. but the voice is unmistakable, you'll know within 10 minutes of the film. and another reviewer here is quite wrong, no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because gabby hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he's clean shaven here. he had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the duke.later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so i'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was. i don't think those that wrote this one knew either.wayne gets yakima canutt as an indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked lone ranger and tonto.it's all pretty silly if you ask me.

let me get this straight:"hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside manner."wow. move over "the notebook", there's a new kid in town.where to begin. well, how about the depth of this "relationship"? i think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps:1. exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad. 2. drink copious amounts of jack daniels; play basketball with old food 3. provide glib, unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. make love during a hurricane. 5. devote your lives to each other via airmail.i noticed george c wolfe has "the hairball" and "united kanye west project" in his dossier. would "stick to your genre" be too harsh? enough said. i think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, or laugh or even hope. but the reason they are able to do that is that, somewhere during the storyline, we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen. to make us care, there must be time spent developing these characters...their lives, their history, why we're watching them now. wolfe didn't seem to want to "waste our time" with such trivialities, and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one-on-one interaction between two actors we've all come to adore, but two characters we could care less about.for one brief tender moment when richard gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him for dinner, the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. but instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy that is courtship, we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know.let's face it. we have all heard cheesy one liners in romantic films. but the reason we cut some slack to bogart in "casablanca" or nicholson in "something's gotta give" is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters, and by the time they deliver the line, we're so deeply involved with their plight, we don't even notice the cheese factor. since wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists, all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience.wolfe takes the old hollywood director's phrase "cut to the chase" much too literally here. as each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast, the viewer is left wondering if director wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: "c'mon. it's a richard gere romance. just buy in."it is as a result of this stunning lack of character - or relationship - development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts. when gere's character dies, i felt like i was watching the news about someone i didn't know passing away. or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics. just. didn't. care.epic. fail.

i like all different types of movies, so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes the matrix etc etc.i just felt it was a lousy movie. i don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. they were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, richard gere and diane lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? it isn't realistic. this movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. some emotional connection. if someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. you are neither right or wrong. different strokes for different folks.another very unbelievable component to the movie was diane lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? this movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a major disappointment.

wow. not because of the 3-d imagery, which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery, but what a lame ending! the end of the movie just seems to implode on itself. this film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. the misogyny of this film is painful as well. if you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at (aka 'bot fodder), go for it. otherwise, look for better films.

without a doubt, the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. there was nothing entertaining about this film. i know it was supposed to be a comedy, but it actually made me cry at the thought of losing the $4.75 admission price.

i consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned in my chair.it's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. not once did i laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. i have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one i remember best - in my nightmares.the only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.this is the worst movie ever.

in all honesty, i haven't seen this film for many years, but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. i can't risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. you have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. i don't know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults.

police officer michael (tomas arana, "the church") has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who's been leaving parts of the bodies of the people that he's been murdering at the house of one recently widowed, tracy (joanna pacula). mike has to find a way to stop the bodies from piling up, while perhaps finding love in the process.a feeling of the 'giallo' films of yore pervades this film, even though we know who the killer is from the get-go, and the film contains a few good set-pieces (a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind being particularly memorable), but it doesn't make all that much sense when all is said and done either. all in all, not nearly as good as bava's earlier "macabre" nor his first two "demons" films, but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film. a pity the image entertainment dvd lacked extras of any kind, as i would have been interested in some.my grade: c-

tu pa tam is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from slovenia, who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas. tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moments. in many interviews director mitja okorn tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didn't cost a lot of money. but thinking that way is wrong. tu pa tam is for me very bad movie. the dialogs are really bad written (90% of the script is consisted of cursing), the characters are stereotypical morons, the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie supposed to be an action comedy) are filmed very very bad and without any style. okorn is just thinking he's even bigger than quentin tarantino, so he's copying his style over all 90 minutes. the humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (okorn probably thinks that constant cursing is funny). in my opinion is tu pa tam very cheap (not only by budget)movie with stupid story and very very bad acting.

of the thousands of movies i've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the "wasted talents" expression. i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (frédéric pierrot, elsa zylberstein,and so on). the "aging" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. the use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that i could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly. so far, antoine de caunes has been quite a good actor, but seeing this one and "les morsures de l'aube" i think he should start considering quitting. please antoine, give up that "master of balantree" project ; i doubt you deserve it.

the actors are so bland that it's almost impossible to tell them apart (pauline kael said of this movie: "the actors have names, but they're truly anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. they simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and by recycling the trick that let fred astaire dance on the ceiling in "royal wedding" (but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing). the low point of the movie is when one of the characters, an airplane tycoon, is trying to convince some other "giants of industry" to come in with him in a moon-rocket consortium, and he shows them a woody woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level! (and to think that robert heinlein worked on the screenplay...)the only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of "amazing stories" sensibility, and even that is done much better in the producer's (george pal) subsequent movie "when worlds collide", which has similar bad acting, but is much more entertaining. however, pal's best sci-fi movie has to be "the time machine".

this movie may bear some historical importance, and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together, the setting, the rocket, the space suits, the surface of the moon, all scream "a classic" - but in the end, the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes, and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments. the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis, but bear too little entertainment value many times.much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine-year-olds. the mature themes, the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as well.the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in "2001", but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient. especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie, and, has star wars not somehow modelled it's space-scrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film? but then again - the inheritance is marginal.if its a real groundbreaking and mega-influential mature 1950ies sci-fi classic you are looking for however, check out "forbidden planet".

i didn't even watch this whole movie. now, i like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. for one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. he sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at earth and this boob says 'can you see brooklyn?' and another guy says 'sure'. and the boob says 'gee, i wonder who's pitching?' pardon me a moment, i think my sides are splitting.when they first get up into orbit the boob says 'the moon is just for looking at! take me back down!' watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the g-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big "the end" on the screen.)we also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity. as baby huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, "that sounds logical!" the no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go up.)how this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. i really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. i think in retrospect it's not the whole movie i hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' omg. i wonder if he checked the fan belts too. maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been quite so excruciating. even so, it's only average. what everyone else is raving about, i don't know.you want to watch a neat 1950's space movie? 'rocketship x-m' beats it all to heck. maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.

this film is just another waste of time. the plot is ridiculous, forced usa drama. the characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic goya and the bad interpretation of bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. i guess it was no a low budget film. definitely not recommended. maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.no more hope in cinema...

i'm going to recommend putting this one in the "skip it" pile as well. i was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it, and a bit more excited when i saw that milos forman directed it. ah, well.....the costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio. there was no distinction between spanish, british and french - everyone dressed like they were at court in versailles. the sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings - the prison didn't feel like a prison, the mansions didn't feel like mansions, and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot, for all that they were probably practical locations.the score was dramatically less than it could have been. i have been a fan of film scores since my youth, noticing, appreciating and collecting them, by which i mean more than john williams. my fiancée is a professional film composer, an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center, and a rising star in the industry. at the start of the film, we had high hopes for it, and it did indeed start off nicely. it rapidly deteriorated, and at several points - including the scene of the release of the prisoners - it actually reached a level of annoyance. i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume. the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene, and didn't integrate itself into the "soul" of the film (think of the music in babel and you'll have an idea of what i mean). it never attained the grandeur it wanted to, but then neither did the film.javier bardem, as talented as he is, was awful. for the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance. during the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like the love-child of keith richards and stuart townshend's lestat. i never got the idea that he cared about the role (which is to say, that the character cared about his life and actions), or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end.natalie portman was very good, although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking lorenzo's hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance. the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly discern, and if it weren't for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn't know they weren't the same character. the prosthetic teeth were horrible, artificial and distracting, but that's no knock on ms. portman.stellan skarsgård was fine as goya. not oscar-worthy, but serviceable and generally believable. i don't know much about the life of goya, or his deafness, but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information, rather than anything that was utilized in the film. i am sure it affected goya's life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter, but you'd never know it from watching this. for the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30% of the time through lip-reading.don't get me started on randy quaid. at least he was a minor character.the script reads like one of the "choose your own adventure" books i used to read as a kid: at several moments through the film, several outcomes are possible, and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out. ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its meager attempts at leavening the mood through small bits of humor. the joke about the hands? maybe it's because i paint (not well) as a hobby and know what a pita hands are to draw/paint, but i saw the joke coming a mile away, as well as the reprise in the second half. was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by ines? there might as well have been a line of bread crumbs.disappointing.(note: this review is a copy of a reply i made to a thread in the forum)

this isn't exactly a complicated story. it's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. with goya's ghosts this doesn't apply. the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail. it jumps from one character to the next, never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching. because of that you don't connect with any of the characters. you don't get to the point where you care. either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems it's going to redeem itself, or their actions are despicable and you're not inclined to anyway. goya's refusal to go very far to help ines is a good example. his refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part. the only characters you may momentarily feel for are ines, when she's being questioned and then tortured. after her rape by lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone. following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around lorenzo's invitation to supper with ines' family, and her fathers all out attempt to force lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back. then just as things start to be developing again, they're gone from the movie. i've read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didn't know what it wanted to be, etc. i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything. from lorenzo's return and the coincidental viewing of ines' daughter by goya, everything seemed nothing more than contrived. without much of a storyline, no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place. the essence of who goya was didn't materialize, other than his actions, or lack thereof, proving him to be more self-centered than anything else. as for his art, the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again frittered away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. to sum things up best, the movie had no cohesion, it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered, and upon ending, left you feeling like what you'd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them. you can't watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination. there's just not enough to it to waste the time. it's not a case of your missing out on something, it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good, just aren't there. as for best film ever made? it's not even the best film i've watched today.

having watched this movie several times, i have come to the conclusion that milos forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the french revolution and the napoleonic era raged across europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. while i do understand that mr. forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, i was left feeling that there was just so much of goya left out, so much of his humanity. the strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that because of man's fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life, each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of god. how eloquent when goya says he should have helped ines more, how true for all of us! we must defend and protect the innocent. the superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die pronounces the death sentence on lorenzo who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius. i was left wanting something more when the credits rolled. maybe less of the unreal coincidences, and more of the inner life of the characters.

i've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. date movie. that was bad. but this...this is just...it's not good. house party 4 is the worst movie ever. it's as simple as that. it's basically ferris bueller with black people in it. oh, and it's not funny. it's awful. so awful. chris stokes may be a superstar on bet, but he's an idiot. he can't write a comedy. or a horror movie. i like to refer to him as a blacker, lesser-known uwe boll. except uwe boll's films are funny awful, if you know what i mean. you can invite some buddies over, pop in alone in the dark, and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies. chris stokes is like that, except if you invite friends over to watch house party 4 with you, no one will be laughing. not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock. i'm serious, i didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie. the acting is terrible, and the movie looks like a bad indie film. what was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? i mean, what the hell? this movie just sucks; don't waste your time with this crap. it's disgusting.

i had this dvd to watch, thinking that i would see a type of biography o painter goya, but the movie was about everything but goya. this movie is about a young woman taken away from her family by the holy inquisition, allegedly because she practiced jewish rituals (only because the poor girl did not like eating pork!). the rest of the movie is about torture, humiliation, driven by a poor script (can't believe it is by jc carrière as i could not believe this cr** is directed by mr milos forman) centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all. ah, and there is goya, i forgot, playing a completely peripheral role - that could be the role of john, paul, peter, manuel, joaquim, jose or anyone. very disappointing - one one these movies that will be forgotten for ever (if it has not had happened yet). rent "the name of the rose" if you want a movie about the holy inquisition. and i don't know what you should rent, if you want to watch a movie about spanish painter goya. maybe a director of a good caliber, not forman, still needs to make it. ps: the spanish painter, goya - the title role who is lost in the plot - is portrayed by a scandinavian actor, something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously. maybe next time we should send javier barden to play the biopic of norwegian painter, edvard munch!

then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. i got the first part with the spanish inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain. the movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and i don't remember much about it. so, the movie gets confusing then. the movie begins when ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of judiasm by the church, specifically father lorenzo. she is put to the question and forced to confess. even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison. her father forces lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp, in hopes of getting ines released. all it does is give a reason for the church to condemn lorenzo, who runs off to france.then, the movie skips many years, and the french revolution is in full force. ines is released from prison. it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up. she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help. she tells him she had a child in prison. goya sets up a meeting between her and lorenzo, whom is now with the french and in power. he is the father. goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo, whom decides it's best to send her off to america, so no one will find out. but before his plans get carried out, the british join the spainish, and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted. that part is not well told in the film. it's like the film shows this to happen in a day.final verdict: the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the inquistion, then the movie expects you to understand what is going on. it just got too confusing to me then.

with a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, goya. then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic inquisition. with even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. with lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, milos forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.milos forman (who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. won awards for it, in fact. his life in czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse, repellent regimes, especially communism. he also made the equally over-the-top but rather impressive, one flew over the cuckoo's nest. so, at the age of 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? in goya's ghosts, goya is one step removed from buffoon. the main character is brother lorenzo, passionately acted by javier bardem. natalie portman is equally vibrant as goya's model ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). the tenuous connection with goya is that he happens to paint both of them.lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) ines who he suspects of being a jew. her father tortures lorenzo. napoleon dashes in to liberate spain (briefly). ines gets out of the dungeon the church has left her in and searches for her child. goya is still painting but has gone deaf. his main preoccupation seems to be helping ines. and so on.historically, goya was also a historian. as forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of goya the painter, this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together  a large slice of history as seen by goya. but the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. similarly, a document of the terrors of the inquisition should be done  compared to other despotic orders throughout time, the holy see has been forgiven with barely a confession. though one might ask if forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything."i thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "there were a great many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the spanish inquisition." but the story is too tenuous to hold our attention. against our expectations and with a background of something major (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the inquisition, and even the french revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted (if kind) infatuation of goya's. the result is that we feel cheated.background detail is appallingly handled. goya went deaf in 1792 (when the film starts), not 15 years later. napoleon is as believable as a cut-out from a cereal packet. we see the church passing out a death sentence (when the normal procedure was for the church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work). battles look overly-choreographed and stagey. a peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it.on the positive side, the production values are mostly good. the colours are vivid, the pacing excellent (at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline.) bardem is excellent, and portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman. while it doesn't say very much about goya, what it does say is nice, even if superficial and pretty irrelevant.i once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and i asked each other, if you could choose a director to depict your life, who would it be? on his record, forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list.

perhaps i missed something, but i found goya's ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama. as to the story it was trying to tell, i found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. and perhaps it should have been made by a spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented english. i can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar "artist's model's tragic fate" plot line as girl with a pearl earring. was the movie a commentary on the religious injustices of the inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what???? i never seemed to be able to figure that one out. natalie portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical. and ultimately the movie was crowned with the concluding melodrama of a disheveled bardem's head and body hanging on the edge of cart heading off into the sunsetwith ines and goya following along behindcan't milos forman do better than that?

i'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. even though marques houston did appear in "hp3", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. okay...so reid and martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. i'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was "hoodwinked"--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. and i'm sorry...kym whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris, ketty lester, or dc curry in the earlier films. although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion...i have to give this a thumbs down!! just naming the film "down to the last minute" would have been ok. furthermore, the hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.

watching this movie, you just have to ask: what were they thinking? there are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie, you might get the feel that its intentionally poor, as some sort of joke.i think the worst part about the film is the directing. there are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad. the funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations by email - the same camera angle is used for each shot (which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece) and the same computer screen with the same desktop/window/program etc appear. it even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time. the whole sequence was also completely silent, with no music, or sound effects. overall, it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over town.if you listen closely, you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks. this is no surprise- most songs, including the one that opens the movie, are in fact slight alterations of scores from other movies (see if you can guess which ones). also, i noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. it sounds like its been written and played through a low end midi keyboard. if you are familiar with the lucasarts scum adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the imuse engine.everything else about the movie just plain sucks. the acting is terrible. the script is derivative (ferris beuller?). there is no joke in the movie remotely funny, unless you see the whole film as one big joke, being played on a paying audience. don't rent this. don't even watch it when it's rerun on comedy central. just forget this - it's terrible.

i too am a house party fan...house party i is my favorite movie of all times. house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the hp's and to kid n play...this was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at house party 3. i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and i have been a fan ever since. when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking about...there was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off.

i saw house party 1-3 and i loved them but this one wasn't funny at all.first it can't be a house party movie without kid n'play right? this one sucks and it was more like a black version of ferris bueller's day off than a house party movie.second who the heck is john-john?these new character's can't even compare to the ones from the other three movies.now i know why they put it straight to video.it has horrible music, weak plot, untalented actors,and no hilarious jokes at all.my advice,watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep.they should have ended the series after house party 3 since kid'n'play separated after that one.i hate this one am glad my local video store doesn't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on comedy central either.just because chris strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming r&b group doesn't mean he has talent directing and producing films am i right or what? finally, the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the flick.imx separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays. in simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks!!!!

i've never saw the first three, but i know they're all better than this...trash. it's about some kid who throws a party. wow. sounds amazing(sarcasm). is it? nooo! it starts off with a kid laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom. so, the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school. he goes to his uncle's house and rounds up some people and throws a party. i didn't laugh at all while watching this trash. i can't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking "man, dis !@#$ is gunna be big, yo!" makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie. i watched this knowing it would be bad, but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. this just disgusted me. two thumbs down!

(spoilers ahead!) this same exact plot from this movie has been done before. it has been done in ferris bueller's day off! marques "bat man" houston plays sick. his gullible parents believe him. his sister knows that he's faking, but she still must go to school! she is mad. he has a party with his friends while his parents are away. by the time his parents get home, he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party. i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature!

oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at august 13th, 2006 (posting no. 881): what an awful experience. it looked like a bunch of 3rd graders stole a video camera, borrowed some old editing software from 1995, and played a joke on each other. trash rgc wrote at august 1st, 2006 (posting no. 747): this movie is a piece of @$#@#@. it sucks calling this a movie would be misleading. this was a group of friends having a good time and videotaping one another. the storyline was very hard to follow. the attempted artistic camera angles detracted from the story and in to themselves made the entire time a dizzying experience. the acting although comical was very amateurish. the concept is ok, i guess. perhaps next time, the producers should raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again. i must say that i'm sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy. it is not easy... this fact seems to be lost or ignored by many that believe that without any training/experience and talent that they can make a good product. i guess in the end they will learn just how difficult it is i am so disgusted i have no comment chrisite wrote at august 5th, 2006 (posting no. 762):

ok, so this is horror? i get horror - but i don't get horrific. black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. the story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. it's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but i hope not. my question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? i guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. well that's been done before too. so i guess he had to go to shock value.....have them killed in the darkest of fashions. okay ..... the audience was shocked......sickened....disgusted.....numbed. and getting up out of my seat , i felt all of these things. so was the director successful? yes! absolutely! these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did. now what do i do with the feelings? and more importantly, what is the "message" here? with the amazing talent that francis xavier was "gifted" with.....could he ever consider applying it to making films that speak of, dare i say, coming out of the darkness? i was left in the dark after viewing this film, my soul was assaulted....is that what this craft is about? there are many such films out there - they make the bucks i'm told. so what's up with the people that want to see all these deploring visuals? what is going on in this world that people will pay to be horrifically shocked? would i see this again.....not ever.

early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. while the lights are out there's another murder...so it's someone in that room.what follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. they act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. most embarrassing is bela lugosi (two years before "dracula") who really overdoes it as a police inspector. static direction by tod browning (who was always overrated) doesn't help.for browning and lugosi completists only. i give it a 3.

some years back, this film had been scheduled for broadcast on tcm uk as part of a tod browning retrospective  but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake!; my brother had watched it (and, in hindsight, it followed the original pretty much scene-for-scene, even down to the set design)  though no classic, he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier version this being the first collaboration between browning and bela lugosi, i had high hopes for it  but these were quashed when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the film's main concern was to appease the still-novel sound technique, and consequently the result is stagey and extremely static. the thriller plot isn't exactly exciting either; even less appetizing is the ostensible british-indian setting (with the characters' affected accents and upper-class demeanor  not to mention the over-use of corny idiosyncratic idioms such as "i say", "rather" and "now look here"  rendering the whole risible more than anything else)! apart from this, there are a few unintended howlers: margaret wycherly (as a fake medium) pleads with police inspector lugosi (if anything, his undeniable screen presence is already evident) to give her some time to 'work out' who the culprit of the double-murder really is (the evidence points to her own daughter, played by leila hyams!)  she hears a tapping and is deluded into thinking that the spirit world has genuinely made contact with herbut then lugosi enters the room and, in his unmistakable accent, straight-facedly tells her "i knocked twice  you didn't hear me!", at which my brother and i almost fell to the floor in convulsions of laughter!!; the editing is really sloppy, too: during one high-angle shot of the main set, a mike is seen being rapidly pulled up out of camera range  and even worse are a couple of instances where a person walks off-screen, ostensibly into the next shot, to another part of the setbut each shot is held on the other actors for an absurdly long time, so that it appears to take forever for this person to walk just a few paces!! the thirteenth chair marks the third non-horror browning talkie that i've watched  even if both this and miracles for sale (1939) deal with murder and occultism and could, therefore, still be linked to the genre. much has been said about the director's apparent slackening with the coming of sound: however, flawed though they may be, the 4 straight horror films he did throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the rest  which i've always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that browning wasn't as much at sea during this period as has been suggested

**spoilers** i rented "tesis" (or "thesis" in english) on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort "the others". based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror. instead i wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film "anatomie" (which this one kinda reminded me of).the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes. it revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student angela's (ana torrent - a jessica harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. angela, and her horror-buff friend chema (fele martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it.this leads to... well, nothing.they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls. there is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and b) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. the rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.seriously - amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life. the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. in "tesis", *potential spoiler ahead* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says "ok, ya got me, it was him after all"! as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck. you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after.the only thing that drags "tesis" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say "look at me! i'm political!". the final scenes, in which the "point" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. if he doesn't, he certainly should. this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff.overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. the urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films ("videodrome" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: "my little eye")... "tesis" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. on every level, this one is better left dead and buried. i'll award it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.

great acting, great production values, good direction.but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. we're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. for instance, we're very clear that rudyard kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books. i don't feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea.the depiction of the war itself is heart-breakingly accurate, though the women's lack of enthusiasm doesn't reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time. perhaps this is historically accurate; like so much in this film, i simply don't know.

this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen. i always liked chuck norris in films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker. i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. i know an african american who looks like this trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, i think this show started great but lost steam as time went onthey should have dumped chucks side kick

i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think "dog the bounty hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of "high octane" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?

this series is formulaic and boring. the episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, walker goes after him, and it ends in a karate match. the villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. after about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. certainly not norris's best work. his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks. if you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clichéd snooze-fests, then this is for you.

walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. the script for james 'jimmy' trivette, walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng, and is played with about as much conviction.on this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). that's not how life works, that's not how people are. this show doesn't take place in this reality.the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. with walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. it's for the elderly. it's for wishful thinkers. it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. it's for people whose drug of choice is their television.i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show. my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.i used to like chuck norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.

this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today. horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. i will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference. with all the negative points this series has, i still prefer it over reality tv, it can't really get any more worthless than that.

this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.

the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of western (or at least american) civilization.read proust, you morons!! or at least dave barry or calvin and hobbes anthologies.chuck norris. wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, hours...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.please don't watch this show!! spare your few remaining brain cells!

first of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (not er or emt, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. on top of that, he is a comic book character---no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development. the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are. and trivett is the ultimate clown in black-face. come on---if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias, then explain why jt is treated as a dolt, always is the subject of walker's jokes, never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues walker, who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does. while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery. but then again, norris produced the show as well as starred in it, so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time. what a terrible series! it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger, roy rogers, the cisco kid, and wild bill hickock, though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows. but like those shows, in the same way as those shows, walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly.

i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country (houston, dallas, austin/san antonio etc.), they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers/cowboy hat , talks with a drawl, has zero fashion sense, and drives a truck on his way to either the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police-truck...anywhere in texas.the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy...they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference. the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away. this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high-brow entertainment. at least knightrider had the talking car.

this was a shockingly bad movie and i literally gasped the first time seeing the blue screen puppets. imagine the worst blue screen special effects you ever saw, make it somehow far worse, and then combine this with poorly made, rubber and play-doh puppets that look like something from a semi-retarded pre-school art class. then add some screeching, yngwie malmstein-esquire, melodic-metal guitar solos stuff that is way too loud and lasts way too long. the overall film is absolutely awful and makes "feeders" look like "rashomon." its one of the worst movies i've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric spiraling dismally downward, much like a waterlogged turd in the perpetual, slow whirlpool of a broken rest stop toilet. still, though, a film like "actium maximus" is not to be missed by the bad movie conesseuirs out there, even if only by looking up clips on youtube or someplace. this movie is a bit of an eye opener, if you can stomach the ride. i think this director may be mentally ill, though, which is a bit debasing. watching him discuss the project, you get the sense that he truly believes that he's created something wonderful. i guess he's the "star wars kid" of gonzo filmmakers. what a mess. :-)

ok, what to say about actium maximus...there are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle 'round to awesome. there are bad movies that just suck in their own right. there are good movies, and so-so movies, and movies that are just fun. then there's actium maximus. you can't make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment. this particular movie is worse than turkish star wars one and the sequel too. those movies are so bad they circle 'round to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if you're stone cold sober. actium circles 'round from bad to awesome, but then it doesn't stop there, it takes another trip to badville, then 'round again to awesome, then finally it sets up a little feudal kingdom on the border of "bad" and "stock footage of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently." if you are into self punishment this movie is for you. it actually will cause your brain to hurt.

i got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with the ruining (which isn't much better). the main reason i wanted it was to see star worms ii: attack of the pleasure pods, the dvd is a double feature with that movie. i really didn't know what actium maximus was at the time, and when i saw the trailer i got scared. it looked awful. but hey, what can you tell from the trailer? well, apparently i could tell a lot. this movie honestly made no sens to me. the special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in god's name is going on. i understand mark hicks had a extremely low budget, but come on. and it is sad, because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. but sadly, watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life. it is so utterly painful to sit through. i really can't even explain the plot to you because i didn't understand it at all and i have sadly seen this film two times! apparently they used some type of puppets for the "alien dinosaurs" like they did in star wars. but these special effects are awful, i can't stress it enough. and most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. it takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they are in the kkk. and some box with a blue light on it is the president. i know in the interview mark hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, i can see why this didn't make it to cbs or nbc. there are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. and 2. lloyd kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious. overall, don't waste your time but check out star worms ii: attack of the pleasure pods!

this movie is awful, i'm sorry. i bought this to get star worms, and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms. oh just kidding, turns out this is the worst movie i've ever seen. the acting is garbage, not that there really is any, and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like, stuff or something. i can't really tell. the special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs, which by the way do not war, but just stand and kind of move their mouths, or whatever those things are. the movie is a headache. it's very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe. hahahahahahahaha... really, this movie is just abominable, even by troma's standards. the only good thing i can say about it is that it's got a lloyd kaufman intro, as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isn't fit for consumption.

a gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on le touquet for a week's holiday. stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, have sex...blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of connolly's book, but to little avail. what should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating. all the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.credit to the always wonderful rampling, plus bouquet and viard but that's it. and dutronc looks like he's rather overdone the nips and tucks, if you ask me...

sickening exploitation trash plays like a bad (and reverse) "death wish" ripoff - but the ugly and untalented tamerlis makes charles bronson look like al pacino with her performance. as for ferrara's "stylish" direction, when a film is so vile, dumb and deeply offensive, it's hard for the viewer to pay attention to such details.

**** mild spoilers _ but you probably know the plot ****woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . oh did i mention the rape victim was mute ? that`s the problem with ms 45 , thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? surely the whole film would have better if we had thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ? there`s just not enough development to this plotas you`d expect from a film by ferrara it`s not a complete waste of time . it`s far better than i spit on your grave and pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis as thana goes on a killing spree at the end . but the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comment the film could have made

as someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. it requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and really believable acting (aka great acting). such is not the case with 'love machine'. it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. it's downhill from there.director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon. but to be fair to eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a real doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, i guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. the film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.

this movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. i couldn't believe what i was seeing, and hearing, and i didn't believe it anyhow. hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. being a hillbilly myself, i know what it should sound like, and it's not kate's back bay accent. the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times, sydney toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match. maybe this was a practical joke, come to think of it. i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting. well, maybe this. i noticed that natalie schaefer, lovey howell on gilligan's island, appeared in this play on broadway. can you imagine what part she might have played?

**** spitfire (1934) john cromwell ~ katharine hepburn, ralph bellamy, robert young mountain hillbilly katharine hepburn (as trigger hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. "going on 18", she begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing rocks. the arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in ms. hepburn. she quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer robert young (as john stafford), who flirtingly hides his marital status. supervising engineer ralph bellamy (as george fleetwood) is also interested in hepburn, but for different reasons; mr. bellamy wants to know more about jesus christ, whom hepburn worships.after hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch.if it weren't so serious, "spitfire" might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, who is thoroughly unconvincing. of the leads, mr. bellamy performs best. however, the best characterization is essayed by sarah haden (as etta dawson), who appeared in george cukor's stage version, along with louis mason (as bill grayson). will geer (as west fry), "grandpa walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. an unexpected ending helps.

this is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as hepburn playing a chinese woman in dragon seed. the lead part hepburn plays is a combination of granny from the beverly hillbillies and a faith healer! this film is even worse than bogart's swing your lady, because at least bogart didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. and the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a li'l abner strip! the problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the "love story" might make your head hurt. for no reason whatsoever, married robert young falls for this ozark bobcat. was it her lovely personality that won his heart? i doubt it, as she as the fiery "spitfire" the movie was named after and she really seemed to like fightin' and scrappin' and hollerin'! was it her feminine charms? with no makeup and fashions that looked like they were designed by ma kettle, i doubt if this was the case as well. to top this off, in the end, somehow ralph bellamy also fell for her, though once again, it really doesn't seem to make any sense.so, here we have two city fellers fallin' for a scrappy unfeminine she-beast played by ms. hepburn--now that's a recipe for a good film!

katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named trigger hicks!), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. constantly-smiling robert young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! no amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by r.k.o. with too broad a hillbilly flourish. it is ungodly, and just about unwatchable. *1/2 from ****

any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a hill billy. her famous new england enunciation slips through, making lines like, "i'd better rustle up some vittles" pretty ludicrous. she's so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw. the story is an old fashioned melodrama, and there fore, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff, but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940's. it has its moments, but you might need to be a die-hard movie buff to appreciate it.

i will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. even at the young age i remember thinking, "this is a baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes baywatch tolerable. the girls in bathing suits." nonetheless i was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. the high point of pacific blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! as a thirteen year old i never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously. even i knew that the task of going out and acquiring uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before borrowing someones car for the day. that had been the defining moment of this show. simple crimes and situations tailor made by hack writing so they could be taken care of by the unsung hero of the crime fighting world the bike cop. does not get much dumber.

although this was the first hunter s. thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as johnny depp, bill murray, gary busey, and a few others. i was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. what kept me watching was some of the old clips from fear and loathing in las vegas and where the buffalo roam. not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. i still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half. still if your a fan i would you'll like anything that has to do with hunter. best regards

david bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili. this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown, over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970. it cost 22 million dollars! that is simply irresponsible. darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said "hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal... lets get this too" and handed over a blank cheque. the result is a hybrid of gigi, zeppelin, half a sixpence, some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge, and mata hari dramatics. the production is colossal, lush, breathtaking to view, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, julie looking befuddled, hudson already dead, the mistimed comedy, and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating. lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. star! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is... and andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour......but lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s..... and made andrews look like poppins again... which i believe was not edwards intention. paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in catch 22, and $12 million in on a clear day and $25 million in paint your wagon....they had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures. maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day ......lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double. thank god paramount had their simple $1million (yes, one million dollar) film love story and that $4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two years....for just $5m.... incredible!

this isn't "so bad it's good"--it's "so bad, it violates the geneva convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment"! only by reading the synopsis can you even figure out the "plot" of this straight to video disaster. it's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see. comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess to "dead men don't wear plaid" is like saying that "gigli" is like "citizen kane". the talentless cast are costumed in cheap, j.c. penney "goin' to church" clothes, and there isn't the slightest attempt at period hairstyles or make-up. if you really want to see how this sort of "homage" can work, check out "the lost skeleton of cadavra"--it's clever, well-written, and best of all, performed by actual actors who aren't such agony to watch. for that matter, seek out the work of phoenix artist paul wilson whose sci-fi short "the attack of the 70 foot courtesy lady" leaves this film in the dust. the people in terror in the tropics look and sound like they were pulled off the street and given their scripts to read during the one and only take. this is an insult to bela lugosi, boris karloff, lon chaney, and anyone else involved in the films they cannibalized to make this schlock-fest! money isn't the problem--a lot can be accomplished with very little expense. a good script, decent actors, and above z-grade costumes and production design should have been a given before the so-called director created this stinky pile of cinematic offal. let's hope the "promise" of a sequel doesn't come true--that was by far the scariest thing shown in the whole movie!!

take it from me as a camera man who worked for republic studios from 1946 to 1950 and then warners bros and paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of crap. sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a dvd is absolutely ridicious.i have seen bad acting in my day but this is no acting. the hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials. i hate to see his fan club. the old films did not jive with the action in many of the scenes. what the hell was that garden scene with three of worst actresses. i never seen a garden on a ship. they could not even emote. i would not mind it if they could have once ounce of acting but the only one was the guy with the translvanian accent. i am sorry but this is not a clever film as some persons are stating. i would think horror film buffs would be insulted by this piece of film.

i had a bit of hope for this hour long film made up of footage from old poverty row movies. certainly it had the possibility to seem like more than a home video mass marketed to the world. unfortunately while funny this movie still feels like a home movie, but with stock footage spliced in.the plot concerns the planned reading of a will on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics. the ship sinks and well...thats the movie.the film promises karloff, lugosi, chaney and others being lifted from old movies to interact with new footage. we get that alright, but mostly we get lots of new video footage made to look like scratchy black and white film, in which new actors prance about. old footage is inter-cut mostly to set the scene, but very little of the old and new actually matches so its clearly just a put on. its not very convincing and is very disappointing for someone like me was looking for a better constructed film.still if you know and love the old poverty row films, (its very spoofy) this might be worth a viewing. i would warn against buying this but it can be had for about five bucks, the price of a rental) so the choice is yours (though if you can get away with not paying for it do so).disappointing.

"the thomas crown affair" is a terrible remake of a not-very-good movie, redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel renee russo.that's it. the plot is negligible, pierce brosnan phoned in his part, and dennis leary (as usual) plays an annoying irish cop, but i couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful ms. russo. there's an okay love-making scene on a stairway, a terrifically sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene, and a roll in the sack. oh, and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran gets sunk.but let's hope other directors recognize ms. russo's perky attributes and cast her in more, highly-visible roles.

i am sure i'm in the minority (i know i am among my friends), but i found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. the fact that the role played by denis leary is the most likable character (the only other time i liked him at all was in "a bug's life"!) speaks volumes. rene russo's character was irritating beyond belief and thomas crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. to say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (no, the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him real.)with the exception of two wonderful scenes (both involving the museum caper and not involving rene russo), this movie made me wish i were at home watching televised golf.

this film is a total bore. entrapment is way better in all aspects, plot, acting, stunts, etc. plus the soundtrack is one of the most annoying i've ever heard. i was close to muting the film just to shut it up. 3 out of 10 stars ***

i had the funny chance of seeing this on mystery science theater 3000, four years ago. i must admit it wasn't as badly done as some other science fiction/horror movies of the time. the plot revolved around an astronaut that came back to earth with alien embryo's inside of him. now the plot is quite weird, well if you can even call that a plot. (seeing a space program run out of one building and an old pickup truck is drop-dead funny!) i'll admit it was horrible by today's standards (and 20 years ago)...but i can see myself 43 years ago watching and being charmed by this movie. it's not even close to the badness of invasion of the neptune men, manos: hands of fate or future war.

i've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. but with a movie as bad as night of the blood beast the plot hardly matters. an astronaut crash lands and is believed dead. his body later reanimates, but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life-form. but how did they get there? and where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in maj. john corcoran's body? imdb lists the runtime for night of the blood beast at 62 minutes. is that right? 62 minutes? it had to be longer than that. it felt interminable to me. even with the mst3k commentary (which was very funny by the way), the actual movie felt much, much longer. and it's pretty much a snoozer from beginning to end. i like a lot of these alien invasion type movies of the 50s, but not this one. it failed to grab my interest on any level. the baby aliens were too silly looking to be taken seriously, the titular blood beast was pathetic, and none of the characters did anything for me. add to that the usual low-budget roger corman trappings and you've got a real loser of a movie.

i accept that most 50's horror aren't scary by today's standards, but what the hell is this? when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast. instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth....yeah which is what the people wanted.the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast....but the title really kills the movie. night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn't any blood to speak of.i like how the 50's movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one. this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen but its almost up there.2 out of 10

this movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films, most spectacularly in "alien" - and some decent "he-man" performances from the male cast. the possessed astronaut's wife, to me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes, for which i blame director corman. given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play, "blood beast" might have been pretty decent. but the inherent cheapness of the production design and the continuity errors and gaffes undermine the proceedings. for instance, every time i saw the comatose astronaut laid out on an "examination table" the width of an ironing board, i broke into giggles, probably not the the emotion the crew wanted to invoke. and the monster's costume needed some serious work; fern covered parrots just aren't scary or convincing.still, the premise was strong enough that i hung on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve itself, and the alien's motives were sufficiently ambiguous at first that i could sort of think of it as an enigma. and the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of punch to it, along with the plot development where the alien claimed to have assimilated some of the dead man's personality. it's corman. it's cheap, fast, and mildly watchable if you don't think too hard or expect too much. what more needs to be said?

what a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the imdb scale as i write this. folks, this is a lot closer to a 3.0, i'll even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where i've put it. come on - how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures, and not give it at least a 4.0 for creativity? then you've got all that great dialog like - "dave, look at the composition of this mud." you know, i don't think they ever got back to that mud. no matter, this is the kind of flick that 'z' movie diehards live for, and i can now rest easy. actually, i saw this quite a few years ago without the proper appreciation for it, along with corman titles like "attack of the giant leeches " and "the wasp woman". i don't know what the fascination might be, but to quote a character from the film - "whatever it is, it works fast!"back to that alien amorphic cell structure - i liked the idea of a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells. when astronaut john corcoran (michael emmet) returned from the dead, i had visions of a scene that might have been a precursor to 1979's "alien", but that was not to be. instead, budget restrictions limit the picture to a de-feathered big bird knock off, even though that concept was still almost a decade away. who knows where one idea leaves off and picks up with another? look, this is not that bad. not that good, but not that bad. anytime you can hook up crash landing astronauts with alien beings committed to taking over the earth, you've got a winning combination. throw in the cheesy monster factor and you're on your way. just remember - "a wounded animal that large isn't good".

for those viewers who thought the 1979 film "alien" the first to depict a male earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, "night of the blood beast," made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise. in this film, america's first man in space crashlands back on earth and, after examination, is thought to be dead. he later comes to again, only with a half dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his abdomen. the mama (?) alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our gravid hero, and she (?) seems to have the body of a bear and the head of yarnek, the rock creature from a 1969 "star trek" episode. anyway, with its short, 62-minute running time, small group of scientists, and cheap-looking monster, this film suggests nothing less than a grade z warm-up for "the outer limits" (which would premiere four years later), but without the fine writing that that show usually boasted. despite the lurid title, this film is decidedly sci-fi, not horror, and offers no scares, no laffs, little suspense and little food for thought afterwards. it looks as if it cost around $100 to make (but probably cost twice as much), and its musical score often seems to have no relation to the happenings (i won't use the word "action") on screen. by the film's end, many questions remain: just how was our hero to give birth to these critters? why does the alien need to decapitate people to learn our language? (to justify that title, no doubt!) why can't the space-traveling aliens land on our planet, rather than needing to hitch rides on our ships? how was our hero impregnated to begin with? these are all matters that this little cheapie can't be bothered with. it really is for 1950s sci-fi completists only.

another gray, horrible bit of schlockiness from the family corman. the first space capsule into outer space crash lands back on earth(with some of the worst special effects ever), and the pilot appears to be dead. but appearances can be deceiving. he's actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including a patronizing misogynist old doctor(who'd also really, really boring), a greasy guy who looks like he's cornered the market on hair oil, another guy so dull he doesn't even make much of an impression, a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry over the old guy's patronizing, and a female photographer with a farah fawcett haircut(pre-farah, of course) and about as much liveliness as a dead duck.what are any of these people's names? i think it was steve. apparently, everyone in the cast, including the women, were called steve. anyway, the dead pilot steve turns out to not only be alive, but to be incubating baby aliens(or seahorses, or shrimp, or whatever) inside his torso. the momma beast that implanted these little critters looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. once again, i am impressed by the laugh-ability factor of the monsters created by the house of corman. the space carrot from venus in it conquered the world is still officially the worst, most laughable monster i've ever seen grace the screen, but the cormans always manage to deliver when it comes to bad, cheesy looking monsters.they also managed to deliver on their other trademarks as well; i.e. a boring, confusing plot, long gray shots(thank god corman did most of his films in black and white, since his color stuff still manages to look somehow gray)two or three locations max, stupid and lame props and special effects, and lots and lots of dull dialog. there's only two deaths in the film(if you don't counted the roasted parrot..err..alien blood beast being offed at the end of the film). cheers rang out through the land, i'm sure, when the alien rips the old doctor's head off and(apparently) eats it. now it can talk in english and has the doctor's memories. it can also move the pregnant astronaut around as though he were pinnochio. the monster's apparent intent is to rebuild its race using human beings as food and giant wombs. there's a confusing bit at the end(well, more confusing than usual, anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this, but it makes no sense whatsoever. something about how humanity is about to follow in its race's footsteps and destroy themselves by something they'll soon create. it never really said what that was. it could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows. its baby minder stabs himself rather than let the alien shrimp crawl out of his body, and the oily guy(and the other guy) burn the parrot-alien to death with a molotov cocktail. ahh,the smell of roasting chicken..err.. alien. end of story, in which the rest of the characters wander off and leave their dead comrade laying on the ground to rot. oh, hell, why not save yourself the expense of a funeral? i'm sure that was what corman was thinking, when he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheaply as possible.

another winner from that 50s , 60s era that i love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .corman never lets you down with these films , they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets , a recipe for good watching for sure . ed nelson a very competent actor got started with corman as well as many other favorites who show up in superman and many of the westerns of the day . the costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking , well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it . film making for the love of it , not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it , it comes thru . these films are a fun time ! even better is the mst3k version !!

warning: spoilers dear roger,during your distinguished career, you've made a wide range of entertainment, some good, some notsogood. "night of the blood beast" falls in the latter category. it's not as unredeemingly awful as say, "the phantom from 10,000 leagues" or, maybe, "the dunwich horror." nonetheless, one of my greatest criticisms of this movie is that i could have made it for you faster, better and cheaper.let's start with the foreward and titles. roger, the rocket sequences look like something from disney's "man into space," not as good, of course. the futuristic rocketship looks like nothing in contemporary 1958. why didn't you just use a vanguard, atlas, or even a viking launch? better still, why not dispense entirely with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it? that's what i would have done for you, roger. second, why have the spaceship crash upon reentry? even a middle school physics student could have told you, your astronaut would have arrived on earth extra crispy and largely deboned. i would have shown your astronaut becoming "possessed" by the monster (maybe by using that great "negative/positive" stuff you used in "war of the satellites"), losing contact with earth and landing in the wilderness. that would also explain how you "blood beast" could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of reentry, but still be destroyed by fire. even with these stupidities. the first half of your movie is pretty good. had you spent some money on decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "outer limits." but, once again, your writer describes ed nelson as the designer of the landing system, then gives him some stupid dialogue regarding magnetism. the biggest problem with the second half of "night of the blood beast" is michael emmet. he's terrible as the doomed astronaut. you should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with ed nelson. you could have combined nelson's responsibilities with those of john dunlap and saved yourself the cost of one actor. i don't know if you actually paid any of these people; but, at least you would saved the cost of catering three meals a day. i'd had also ditched the "scorched parrot" costume and spent the extra money using makeup to have the astronaut turn into the "blood beast". maybe that was a little too close to "the creeping unknown" for you, but it would have helped the pace of the second half immensely. if you are going to have a "blood beast," wouldn't it be a good idea to show a little blood? yeah, i know the title comes from the embryos in the astronaut's blood, but kowalski could've done a lot better job for you if he poured a little chocolate syrup around. after all, it looks like blood in black and white. what've that cost you, maybe two bucks? i'd have also used some closeups. for some reason insipid dialogue and bad acting don't seem quite so bad in closeups. look at almost 70s tv series and you'll see what i mean. oh, in closing, roger, a note to your writer. you can't use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of alien embryos when you don't have any electricity. remember, you fried the generator in the first reel? oh,and i almost forgot. roger, couldn't you afford a fake knife? you know, the kind where the blade goes into the handle. i had one of those when i was 9, which also happens to be the year "night of the blood beast" was made.it cost, maybe, another two bucks. i think i knew enough then to make you a better movie. i know i know enough now to do so. so, roger, if you decide to remake "night of the blood beast," or if you are looking for a writer/director to work with you on some other project, i'm your man. i'll work cheap, 'cause i'd really like to make a movie for you, roger.i give "night of the blood beast" a "3". special note: if you like to watch kitschy movies like "night of the blood beast," the dvd i bought for $3.99 was very good quality. you can also get "night of the blood beast" along with a lot of other terrible horror/scifi movies at places like bestbuy for about $6.

after an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! this film comes to us from director bernard l. kowalski, who also directed "attack of the giant leeches" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on "columbo". executive producer was roger corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.this movie is cheesy and poorly constructed. what comes across as interesting is the poor effects, not the actual film itself. one scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos and it's an embarrassing cartoon representation. even for 1958. and then when a full-grown alien appears... you'll wonder why he is wearing shoes. or if you're really perceptive, you'll wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other movies.by no means is this the worst science fiction film you'll ever see. and you almost have to give it some credit -- the alien host overtaking a military base idea predates both "the thing" and "alien" by a number of years. i don't know if these films were inspired in any way (i doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. beyond that, though, the film flops and is only great for heckling when drinking. i haven't seen the "mystery science theater" version, but this sure is one film worthy of their insults.

"an astronaut (michael emmet) dies while returning from a mission and his body is recovered by the military. the base where the dead astronaut is taken to becomes the scene of a bizarre invasion plan from outer space. alien embryos inside the dead astronaut resurrect the corpse and begin a terrifying assault on the military staff in the hopes of conquering the world," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.a roger corman "american international" production. the man who fell to earth impregnated, mr. emmet (as john corcoran), does all right. angela greene is his pretty conflicted fiancée. and, ed nelson (as dave randall) is featured as prominently. with a bigger budget, better opening, and a re-write for crisper characterizations, this could have been something approaching classic 1950s science fiction.*** night of the blood beast (1958) bernard l. kowalski, roger corman ~ michael emmet, angela greene, ed nelson

this slightly ponderous late 50's sci-fi-horror schlock isn't entirely a loser. it's about a manned space rocket that crash lands in a remote area. a bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma; he's being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. anyway, the title alien monster soon raises it's head causing general havoc, including partial head removal.the main problem with the film is it's pacing. it takes quite a while for the blood beast to appear, and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so. he is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but that's really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief. at the end of the movie where we have the final stand-off and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier, you will be doing well not to have a giggle. so too in the brilliant x-ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating about in the astronaut's body - it's just too funny for words.but unfortunately, the fun moments in night of the blood beast come too few and far between. if you're a 50's sci-fi nut though then it's well worth checking this one out. just don't expect too much.

oh, there are many worse wayne movies. this movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable. the villain is an anglo actor who sports ridiculous mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top mexican accent which is hilarious. the girl is dressed like a jean harlow wannabe, this is 1934 after all. at least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable.watch it and laugh. don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor. wayne is almost ludicrously young and handsome and one can see his acting ability blossomed years after this regrettable venture.

it's been a long time since i have been in the art-house theater and i went to see douches froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers.the thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters.when it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. there is no real character development or interconnection between the players. you start in the middle of a situation, all of the sudden there's a girlfriend and then there's a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions, but the way they are put together is quite odd, since they are "just put together", so it seems.and all of the sudden they have sex with each other, at least one you can see of. the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was "when are they gonna have sex again?". and when you think of it, it's quite insane really. because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at, but three teens going at it and that, for me at least, makes it a very crappy movie, stay clear from it and save your money (my 7,50 is wasted), there are better art-house movies than this one.i give three stars for the acting performance, one each.

i chose this movie because i was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys. as i lived this situation and get lost in it, i hope a similar story would inspire me. my major concerns are: - why (a) & how (b) the triangle forms ? - why (c) & how (d) the triangle degenerates ?(a) the movie offers a plain answer: "because it's better !". (b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together. mine was a closed one: every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one: (c) the movie doesn't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual & emotional assumptions: the end comes with sensuality, sexuality coming up in the triangle, or more accurately, when for one member, deep feelings are tied with intimacy, and, as for the latter and the former, they can be divided. i agree with that.(d) in the movie & in my story, silence is the proof that something isn't well.. and in a ironic and painful way, the tool for this sad times, is always the phone: i lived this dreadful planned phone-call: "call me back: i wait you" and when time comes, the phone is silent. a variation is also shown, when the line is connected but one refuses to speak all those scenes were very very hard to see for me.if the movie was a great help in that way, he got also a lot of flaws:- i zapped on the boy's family problems- why the shower scene on the dvd cover is cut on the movie? - how mickael gets finally into the hotel ? - is clément always seeing salomé ? he says "no" but has her address; and who is the girl with him in the bar: his girlfriend ? how can she knows about the address ???- what finally happens to vanessa: the ring at the final shoot is a proof of engagement ??? with whom ?????

other reviews have talked about how frank this film is, especially in terms of male frontal nudity. well, those who've seen grande ecole with its frequently naked actors and expect something similar are in for a big disappointment. other than a few seconds in the judo team locker room, the two leads' side by side shower lasts a grand total of 15 seconds. the female lead has comparably brief frontal moments. a lot of this film's marketing is geared to the gay male audience, but those expecting even a hint of homoeroticism between the two male leads (best friends who have a three-way with the girlfriend of one of them) will be most disappointed. there is not even the hint of either one's being interested in the other, or even scarcely aware that the other is part of the menage a trois. as a film, douches froides is curiously uninvolving; the viewer gets very little sense of who these three young people are, of how they are feeling, of why they behave as they do. about one hour of the original cut was deleted; perhaps this is why the finished film seems frustratingly undeveloped. stick with grande ecole, a french film which more than delivers on its promises.

bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have house payments like me! this low budget film made in mexico reminds me of a few of those italians stinkers from over seas. i heard, i do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. i believe this because why else would they make this film, it sure wasn't to make money. we had a whole lot of these canadian made stinkers, because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry. i wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in canada. anyway, back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect, i believe they grabbed charles bronson in order to sell this stinker; that dead body at the end looks very phony. 3/10

the evil that men do (1984) was one of the few non-cannon films charlie bronson made during the 80's. unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or entertaining. charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. if you thought he was mr. emotion before, wait until you see this! in this one, charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper. this one is no fun. it's not cheesy or campy, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. i didn't like this one. i have no love for this film. no recommendations because it's not worth watching. maybe if they didn't cut the hell out of it. watch with precaution.don't bother.

"the evil that men do" begins with a truly repellent torture scene, followed, a little later, by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repellent torture methods that the sadistic, heartless villain likes to use. but despite the use of such strictly-for-shock effects, the filmmakers can't really cover up the fact that this is just a dull, low-grade bronson vehicle. bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better script.

whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew whereof he spoke. he might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "kay hoog" reminds one more than a little of both lamont cranston (the shadow) and clark savage (doc savage). (the shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first "dark knight"- was also thought to be one kent allard. if one were to take savage's first name first and add to it the kent, you end up with- voila- clark kent. funny, innit?) like indiana jones, hoog isn't above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less "charmingly roguish" than jones's). unfortunately, this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. one of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback, quite literally breathing down his neck, simply watch as hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films.the second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. granted, this was one of the first ever serials and, as such, should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (at one point, the capture of the hero is effected not on screen, but in the narration itself! talk about cutting corners...) fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, the spiders is a bitter pill indeed to swallow...

well, well... even if you're a fervent admirer of lang's silent films, this early one - the first part of a two-part unfinished four-part serial(!) - will leave you in doubt about fritz's narrative skills. (his directorial skills aren't that evident either, but here and there one senses his talent for building up atmosphere.) the pic's just pure juvenile nonsense, which wouldn't be half as bad, were it not for the long ponderous stretches in between the childish action scenes.but the whole affair almost gets by on its amiable innocence.4 out of 10 inca treasures

this is strictly for pryor fans. just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a b-movie. the script is awful, it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. it balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. first there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... how more can you pander to your audience?... that prison time is boring, unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep. back in the u.s. the guy for no real reason at all is considered a "war hero". yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps. or are they really? we will soon find out. yawn. there are annoying clichés: his sick mother, his little daughter he never meets, a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc. it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant. doesn't work at all. overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war. just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian, played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly, unconvincing, unfunny comedy. but if you like richard pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of dadaist poetry.

i was reading in a stuff magazine about some of the goriest, bloodiest films that asia had to offer and i immediately jumped to netflix to quench my thirst. boy what a mistake i made. this movie is one of the worst films i have seen. first and foremost no plot, what i expected to be the plot (see: "revenge") turned into a series of events just happening in a effort to spend their special effects budget of $14.89 and waste studio time. they should have kept their money and not wasted their time nor yours.when a major plot twist occurs, tetsuo ii: body hammer is given a new identity and i wasn't buying it. a flashback is given that should answer our questions, but seemed to me like i turned on showtime at 3:47 am and dropped acid. the movie continues and spirals out of control with cheesy graphics and special (olympic) effects.do i seem bitter about this film? yes. did i see iron man? no. was there a plot? no. was it so symbolic that i didn't understand? no. was there a body hammer? beats the hell out of me. so take my advice and stay away!!!!!! (i must admit though i have had so much fun writing this and laughing to myself about this film that if you want to laugh, watch it!!!)

a true yawner and a bad film even for the chan series. i like a good charlie chan film or even a reasonably good one, but this one falls way short of the mark. charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. the mystery is very pedestrian and the acting doesn't fare much better. the only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of mantan moreland as birmingham brown. he gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. benson fong is here as tommy chan and pairs up with chan's daughter of all things. what about sidney toler? he is pretty decent but looks like he is straining to carry the film. what i noticed most was the way the film was shot. chan director phil rosen, of whom i generally like most of his entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). why? the film is only 64 minutes long for crying out loud! shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to. this probably isn't the worst chan film ever made, but up to now it is the worst i have sat through unfortunately.

this is a below average "whodunit" with the cliche everyone in the living room routine. charlie chan is a secret service agent doing government work, and he must find who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat german u-boats in world war two. there is little to recommend with this movie, since the neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot. charlie chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing. who dunit? who cares?

i honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy, even though i've liked alvin and the chipmunks for a long time! i was was very wrong. it was great!!! it has been the best movie i have seen since october! in my opinion, it's the movie everyone should see this holiday season! enchanted (i thought anyway...)was awful, the golden compass was alright, but the ending was pretty crappy to his dark materials fans, and i am legend, well i haven't seen that yet (or national treasures 2) but it looks alright.i'm not about to give anything away, but this movie is great for anyone, especially kids!

the writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.example: when dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain, i was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it. nothing! are you kidding me? a truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that, but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.there were at least 10 other similar situations. overall, small children will enjoy this, parents will endure it without too much complaining.

i'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. the chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but i wondered why.i don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but i expected to be entertained. it's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as i can tell. simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'. we've seen more than enough of that with britney spears, et al, haven't we?don't bother.

you know the old saw about a train wreck? the one about how you can't look away? this movie isn't that good. the only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. you might catch a nap.tim hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. he manages to take a decent comic actor in jason lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.i didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, i admit. if it weren't basically the only family film i could take my son to around christmas, my wife and i wouldn't have gone. god, i wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. i leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker i thought it was, but she beat me to the punch.i'm not kidding. it's putrid. only david cross's terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.the story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent "curious george" was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). the acting is mostly poor. the decision to "update" the chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst. it does not work.the chipmunks of old were clever, mischievous and sly. these chipmunks are dumb, somewhat mean-spirited, obnoxious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of uselessness.either as a retrospect, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails. the final straw? my son couldn't wait to leave. spend your money renting curious george instead.

when i finally got around to seeing this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance... yet another hollywood cg/live-action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. nothing special or memorable whatsoever. designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of theodore's butt.this film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the chipmunks. even their characters i found were changed for the worse for this movie. while in the past each one of them had a very distinct personality, here they all behaved like immature, smart-alecky children with add, constantly bouncing erratically off the walls. it especially bothered me to see simon portrayed in this way... he's supposed to be the smart, serious nerd who acts as the "straight man" to alvin's crazy antics. but here he's pretty much a carbon copy of alvin. one joke in the film even implies that simon only *thinks* he's smart but really isn't... and honestly if i had never heard of the chipmunks before seeing this film, i would have agreed.in my opinion, this film is just another obvious cash-grab, and i'm more than a little sorry it was even made. the fact that it's a "kid's" movie doesn't excuse its flaws... to excuse a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because it's for children is insulting to children, and any kid would deserve something more intelligent than this film.

as cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. i thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. it was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. then it somehow just lost that. i wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. the fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. my daughter noticed it, too. she's 4 - she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie, then her laughter stopped. perhaps it took on too serious a tone - the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death. something happened, anyway, and it wasn't for the better.of course, the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks (alvin, simon and theodore) began. everyone knows the christmas song. here we discover how they met dave and got their start. the movie is updated to the present time, although their real origin is noted by dave's street address of 1958, which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created. jason lee did a pretty good job as dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. david cross as the evil ian irritated me to be blunt, and i couldn't figure out the point of the character of claire, played by cameron richardson. she added little to the movie. it's a movie you can watch with the kids - it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids, in fact. it gets a 4/10 from me.

i went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. jason lee, david seville in the film, is horrifying. i understand it can't be easy to act with cgi characters who aren't actually there, but i really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. the chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film. if you feel you must see this film, rent it, at the most. it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters, unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting.

something of a disappointment. lee j. cobb is the anti-union head of roxton garments in new york. his partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the scariest scene in the film.cobb doesn't know it, or doesn't let himself realize it, but the man behind the killing is richard boone, who protects the business from union organizers.then cobb's son, kerwin mathews, returns from europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop. he's shocked -- shocked! -- to learn that boone has been clobbering the union members and killing a few who have become irretrievably irritating.robert loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by a couple of boone's goons, led by wesley addy. loggia leaves behind a widow, gia scala, with whom mathews, understandably and decorously, takes up.in the end, cobb pays for his self deception, addy and boone get their just desserts, and mathews winds up with the succulent scala, after whom an opera house is named.there isn't a sparkle in any line of dialog. a couple of lines are stolen verbatim from "on the waterfront" -- "pistoleros", "you'll talk yourself right into the grave." the plot is schematic and holds absolutely no surprises. vincent sherman's direction is pedestrian. the photography is flat an uninspired, though there are a couple of nice shots of new york streets.lee j. cobb can act. in this case, it must have been easy for him because he replays johnny friendly from "on the waterfront," only this time with a soft heart. richard boone can act too. joseph wiseman, in a minor part, does a good job. gia scala hits her marks, says what the script demands, and does what the director tells her to. a stunning woman, her life soured early on. the director and photographer do a good job on wesley addy. he has white hair, a blanched face, eyes the color of a glacial lake, and he's sometimes shot through a wide-angle lens than turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into those of some kind of parasitic fish. i don't see him as a low-tier muscle man though. he and boone should have switched roles. harold j. stone is his reliable self, although he's forced to be more "italian", as tony, than comes naturally to him. nobody else in anything resembling a major part is more than mediocre, and some performers don't clear even that bar. kerwin mathews may be a nice guy in real life, but he's blandly sterile and belongs in domestic dramas on afternoon television.great title, suggestive of intrigue and shadows. some good people in the cast. a potentially explosive expose of a business nobody knows much about but which deals in megabucks.and it all comes out like this.

tom stern and jeremy slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino, ala "ocean's 11", and pin it on the hell's angels. bad move. for a film with the words hell's angels and the number 69 and featuring actual hell's angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. the hell's angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them. not this snoorefest. luckily this is one of the dvds that features commentary by joe bob briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated. if you watch it any other way, let me recommend something to you. don't!! my grade: d dvd extras: joe bob brigg's commentary; conny van dyke's message to her fans (she has more than one?); photo gallery; theatrical trailer; and trailers for "blood shack", "hell high", "samurai cop", and "the hollywood strangler"

the hell's angels did come out the losers in this movie. sonny stated to the director that nobody does this to the angles and gets away with it. his version was the two dudes were to be shotgunned to death, but his suggestion was ignored. they were stoops to even appear, much less be "technical advisers" in a stink-bomb of a movie like this. hell's angles on jap bikes? c'mon! (although in sonny's autobiography he says, "f$#k harley davidson!" and that if they was smart, they would be riding hondas. (st1100) read his auto...he hates harleys. can you imagine the angels whispering into town on their sewing-machine sounding jap bikes? not too intimidating. they would get laughed out of town.

steve smith has finally run a fairly weak series right into the ground with this movie. poor actors thrashing a horrible script pretty much sums this one up. two hours of your life you'll never get back! go get a root canal instead - you'll enjoy it more.

essentially this is a dreadful film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you, depending on how much you want them to. in "opening up" "the red green show" for the big screen, the filmmakers jettisoned the rustic charm carefully honed over a decade's worth of episodes set in and around possum lodge in favor of a blandly-photographed "road movie" with a ghastly faux-hollywood "big" musical score and profoundly boring storyline that's not embellished with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the tv series.having devised a plotline that keeps most of the members of possum lodge offscreen for most of the film and requires virtually everyone concerned to be despicably mean to the loveable harold (who's the hero of the film, the usually affably crusty red being relegated in this incarnation to nothing more than the role of head harold abuser), the only performers who really get to shine are patrick mckenna and peter keleghan as harold and ranger gord, who deliver satisfyingly large-screen versions of their small-screen characters.

i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction, awkward dialogue, a lackluster pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout. just not funny! the sets looked cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent donfeld are garish and distracting. even the title song is annoying. the whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job. for a film that seems to aim a dart at the unfairness of welfare and unemployment systems, the filmmakers have no problem in being unfair themselves, allowing hispanic, black and gay stereotypes played at such a cruel level. the look of the film resembles any episode of love american style. this is not a compliment. tacky seventies fashions abound in this world of white collar theft that only lends an air of implausibility to every situation. outside of a clever initial idea, and two capable stars in jane fonda and george segal, this dated exercise in social commentary comes off as forced and mean spirited to minorities, especially to gay people. if you want a better caper film, you're better off with the hot rock with george segal and robert redford or what's up doc with ryan o'neal and barbra streisand. now that's funny!

this film without doubt is one of the worst i have seen. it was so boring that i simply could not wait for it to end. i talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say "your nuts" the scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around. the acting was un-inspiring and the film was simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a dvdr.guy pierce should have stuck to neighbours as at least he washed his hair. all he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as a salesman. he would have been sacked weeks before. his girlfriend (once in coyote ugly) should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in that.the guy who played vincent (those who watched know) was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2.i do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it. i actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture i went through.

what can i say...not much to this one at all. pretty dull and uninteresting.the actors performances are just ok. the only one that shines in any way is simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. i understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but i can't help but feel his talent was wasted. no one else rose above mediocre.the story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning, but then just doesn't go anywhere. there wasn't a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like i had just seen something special. the cinematography was fairly bland...i mean desert in a washed out sort of sepia...not very inspiring.the story of his childhood pal back outta prison seemed only partially thought out and didn't really add anything to the story, other than making an average 'twilight zone' script into a full length feature.drab.

"first snow" has an intriguing beginning. a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. from this point on the movie plays out like a bloated "twilight zone" episode. i mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. william fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but guy pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia. the ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience. do yourself a big favor and avoid this one. not recommended. - merk

what is night vision? well according to the star (williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' what in the hell does that mean? in fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? it has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. not to mention a cop on duty drinking, robert forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders. that's actually all i remember.the film took place in texas, had a few car chases, and a clichéd ending. perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good? after all, without being able to see it....it would make for better.....night vision. did that make sense? nope. and neither does this film.

trying to catch a serial killer, did they ever think of tracking the license plate number of the black van or fingerprint the video tapes he sent? oh brother the plot of this movie was so full of holes it was pathetic. now i know why there are bad movies in the world. this one however was one of the worst.

the only reason i bought this dvd is because cynthia rothrock is in it.now everybody knows she is the queen of martial arts b movies.the trouble is this is not a martial arts movie.cynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of fight scenes in this stupid movie.now if you were a film maker and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie would'nt you want to have a lot of martial arts action? all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crap.i own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them.if you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what.i'm still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this dvd

fred "the hammer" williamson delivers another cheaply made movie. he might have set a new standard for himself. look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible in the street during a chase scene. you don't see it just once, you see it several times. look for the out of focus shot in one scene and the camera operator try to fix it as the scene rolls on. watch this with a group of people and make your own mystery science theater!

fred williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. cynthia rothrock, one of the two or three top american female action stars. imagine a film with these two together for the first time! now imagine the worst film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. welcome to "night vision". of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction. they got neither here. rothrock does get to throw a couple of kicks near the end, but this film is so atrocious that you probably won't be awake to see them. (*)

unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, i'm really not the much of a cynthia rothrock fan, to say the least. however when i saw that the movie had fred williamson and robert forster (both great actors), i just had to watch the film. williamson is a dakota smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with cynthia at the behest of the captain (robert forster). forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd. it also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid. williamson would return to the dakota character in a few more films, the next one being "down n dirty" eye candy: nina richardson shows some t&a; mary kapper goes topless my grade: d where i saw it: showtime extreme

by far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. i am disappointed in nickelodeon and nick jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. the wayan's brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. they should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. usually the young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older, they move up to programs for young adults. a good example is nick cannon. he first started out with appearing in all-that, later on he starred in mib ii, then drumline, and now his tv show, nick cannon presents: wild 'n out, where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. this comment was originally for thugaboo, but i wanted to show examples of how celebs kids watched on tv not long ago can become those who get involved with non-kid-friendly programs. it is very sad that this happens, but all celebs change and grow up. it is just the opposite with the wayan's brothers new cartoon. it is bad enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos, with allowing the young generation watch this program, it will just convert the kids with possibilities to the ones who don't have a chance at a good life. just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs on what will happen to our children if they were to watch it.

this cartoon is not right,lol i totally disagree with a lot of things it portrayed however it ended on a positive note , but as for me and mine we will not be viewing this in our household mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel black people act likethe comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious (he was white ) that really offended me that's not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability

this movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(john candy)to lead them back east. sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. and richard lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then i honestly don't like him at anything he does. ed lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.the movie was dedicated to candy. he died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed. a stand in and digital enhancement enabled candy's character to be seen in the final scenes. candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee slapping, belly laughs in his career. this movie was just not the caliber of his best.also in the film, you will recognize: william sanderson, gailard sartain, ethan phillips, ellen greene and rodney a. grant.

"wagons east" is widely known as john candy's last movie, as he died on the set. that's just what makes it so sad: not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. seriously, i don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap, but the flick has no redeeming qualities. it's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it. no wonder john candy didn't want to make the movie; maybe his contractual participation was what did him in.anyway, the point is that candy did much better than this throughout his career. to be certain, he had already completed michael moore's "canadian bacon", in which the united states declares war on canada. just stick with that one and you can say that candy ended his career honorably. as for richard lewis - who previous had co-starred with candy in eugene levy's absurd but hilarious "once upon a crime" - he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on "countdown with keith olbermann" in later years.

wow - thank god i was on an airplane and could look out the window. bad hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly acted (who the hell was that awful woman who played the wife?), badly casted, awfully written. this movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person who's willing to kneel at the alter of either firemen specifically, "heroes" or gods in general, i suppose. i just don't have enough bad things to say about this film. it couldn't have been cheap, either, with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes. had to have cost a fortune, yet it still sucked worse than any movie i can even remember seeing. funeral scene? astonishingly bad. courtship between fireman and aforementioned awful woman? corny, contrived, trite. firehouse pranks? don't we all wish we could be both so manly and churlish at the same time.

is there a fire fighter cliché that is not used in this film? from the opening line "i'm getting too old for this" through the "antics" of the firemen, to the "worrisome wife" the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at disney ("our studies show that audiences really like it when..." and then they stuck it in).there is nothing original here. any emotion we feel for these guys is brought in for our admiration and feelings for firemen. go watch rescue me if you want to see real heroes: everyday guys with flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers.

as much as i respect firefighters for what they do. i was unimpressed and bored with this film. the acting was ok but joaquin phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.what bothered me the most about this film was the celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. the directing and continuity was pretty bad too!**spoiler** for example, after phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio. then miraculously, he manages to crawl across a huge space covered in rubble and fire to punch a man-sized opening in a double thickness brick wall using only a foot-long piece of re-bar???? and to top it all off he then gets ultra weak and busted-up again.did anyone also notice that throughout the film, whenever you see shots of joaquin fighting fires and rescuing people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. i would think the smoke should be pretty thick in a flame engulfed building.i also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yelling "i need some equipment over here!!!".i really thought i would enjoy this film but i found it to be a weak attempt at representing the true life of a fireman. the intention was there but i honestly think that this film could have been so much better. i couldn't help but think that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters. more time should have been spent on editing and ensuring there was good flow to the film.the special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. kind of like a jerry bruckheimer movie.call me critical but i just can't see what's so great about this movie. at least it wasn't as bad as "the whole ten yards" which is by far the worst film i've seen in recent months.i really hope there isn't a ladder 50 in the making!

this is a poor, poor movie. full of clichés, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions!!, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!! did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something!!? anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke. it's a pity, because firefighters do an awesome job, and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.

i remember seeing this years ago, it had a reasonably promising start, with an interesting premise, but then it degenerated into nonsense quite quickly. uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of simplistic philosophy thrown in too, all culminating in a terrible ending. simply, it's trash. before i saw this tv film, i didn't think i would ever have any film that i thought was the "worst" i had seen, but after i finished watching this, i knew that from then on, if anyone asked me what the worst film i had ever seen was, i could say without hesitation - "the second coming".avoid.

i went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the second coming. boy, was i ever wrong. bbc are dullards at pacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. and this movie is no exception to the rule of how much bbc sucks.ugh, the pacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. the first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. i kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would end. they wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written. everything that happens is just to kill time.out of 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). what a shame. reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. the preaching, the "am i god" endless blah blah blah-ing, the dumb as doornails boring miracles... ugh.do not watch this crap.

one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and judgement day. this film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard british social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.actually, good candidates for a real third testament have been published several times - like "a course in miracles" or "conversations with god". they all have thought-provoking new twists and angles for christian faith and theology.the most interesting information in imdb's rating is not the number of stars, but how many people who have bothered to vote. in four years, only 387 people have bothered to vote for this film. as usual, the enthusiasts are the most eager. for comparison, have a look at "jesus christ, superstar" - original version from 1973.

as i don't have a tv, and had never heard of this mini-series, i didn't know what to expect from the second coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis, which sounded interesting.dear god! (every pun intended.) if someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year olds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play i wouldn't have been surprised.why, oh why did they decide to portray jesus mark ii as what amounted to an idiot savant? is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this? okay, an ordinary bloke, but a great northern moron. i don't think so.apparently all jesus did to impress people was his miracles, because according to this take his preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone. certainly without the night into day stunt mr jesus eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe, a paddle or any kind of following at all.and the odd little gay polemics put in willy-nilly, without rhyme or reason. other than, of course, russell waving to his qaf fan base. jesus turns up in the pub to recruit 'disciples' (more gormless northern losers and, of course, the gay writer's standby - the harpy woman, nag, nag, nagging away). gay rights are rammed down his throat to no real purpose, almost like russell thought he 'owed it to the lads' to put jesus on the spot. i can't really see the real jesus coming out with "well, i've nothing against it personally, mate." only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine jesus to be quite this wet.and don't start me on the ending. 'please come in and eat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if god dies'.it was like an eddie izzard sketch of god as bill gates. "hello, i'm bill gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style i'm going to give it all to you, my customers." and eat the rat poison, of course.i'm often mystified by the ratings on imdb, but the high rating on this one takes the biscuit.never mind jesus for the new millennium - this is jesus for brainless mtv lads.god help us all indeed.

possible minor spoilerit's not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing. like a lot of russell t. davies'work, it asks more questions than it can answer. his best work (bob & rose, doctor who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. i suppose the fact that i'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes. i would, however, disagree with the reviews i've read complaining that the end feels "tacked on." i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show. while i never really questioned the progression of events, i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon. i've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two, and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece. however, these flaws appear throughout, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in.to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big, and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. strong points include christopher eccleston, who is positively mesmeric in the lead. for me, he was and remains the best reason to watch. the depiction of the messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both davies' writing and eccleston's acting. i also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true. so, two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. i would rather be uplifted or, at least, distracted by my fiction. i have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through cnn or the newspapers -- if i choose to be horribly depressed. there are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but i'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.

korine's established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker. the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular i've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). the opening images of this film, of michael jackson lookalike (diego luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: roy orbison's "mister lonely" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion. there's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance, without music (though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him), in the middle of a paris street; korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine.the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; father umbrillo (werner herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over, and drop food into, impoverished areas nearby. in a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting, herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco. as the exchange develops, herzog draws out of the man a confession: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place. this scene, short and sweet, gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when korine and co. were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him, in real life, a lasting, overwhelming guilt.henceforth, the film is hit-and-miss; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous, muddled narrative. whereas gummo and julien donkey-boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks, mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness. a few scenes were cut from the film, which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters, due to continuity errors in costume - a result, no doubt, due to the absence of a shooting script and korine's tendency for improvisation. one deleted scene in particular - in which 'charlie chaplin' (denis lavant) and 'madonna' (melita morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film (i won't spoil it, but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half-succeeds).the two strands of the narrative, unconnected literally, are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (it's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) but there's not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film, and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is, in retrospect, tedious.this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkey-boy that suffers mostly, at least in the lookalike segments, from having far too many characters for the film's running length, a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone (as was originally planned).with many of the imagery's self-contained beauty, and moments of real, genuine connection with the soundtrack, this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition. as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation, it'd lose none of its power - indeed, for me, it would perhaps be more impressive. the loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well-captured in images such as that wherein 'marilyn monroe' (a gorgeous samantha morton) seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest, or when 'sammy davis, jr.' (jason pennycooke) settles, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake.as it is, moments like these, and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene, are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be.(for those who see it, i lost all faith during the egg-singing scene, late on. you'll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed.)

why would anyone make a film like this? why would anybody invest in a film like this? why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this? why would any theatre show a film like this? why would any tv channel program a film like this? why would any critic bother to review a film like this? why would anybody watch a film like this? why would mental examinations not be made of the writers/producers/directors of a film like this? sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good. this is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible. imdb really must institute a "0" or even a minus scale to embrace works of this appallingly pretentious awfulness.

too fractured to be enjoyable, too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable mr lonely is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making. like a ken russell film at its worst, or day of the locust remade by amateurs, mr lonely might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper (no script, you see) and a free holiday to somewhere, but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that everything they did was a brilliant creation. or did i get the film maker right? mr lonely is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) quirky and deliberately off kilter. it ends up being annoying and indulgent.. and pointless. what's the point of going to a commune in scotland? what a stupid idea in this film about hollywood delusion. maybe korine wanted to remake godspell ... well the result is god-awful. oh and there is some subplot like leftover footage from fitzcarraldo including werner herzog, nuns and a plane. add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy, add james fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring (like in performance) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. it might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess. imagine american pie band camp with food poisoning.

i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad. this movie has terrible everything: the dialog is corny and cliché', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). this is so bad, it's funny to watch. if you can catch this on lifetime, i'd recommend it highly as a comedy. as for being a serious movie, i'm afraid i'll have to rate this a 2.don't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline, or good acting. there is none to be found.edit: hmmm... i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down. don't believe them. this is a really crappy movie.

... or should i say unintentionally hilarious? either way, this is one of the best comedies i've seen in a long time. i was laughing throughout at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters this side of homer simpson. it's just one forehead-slapping, painfully stupid scene after another as the clownish, dim-witted cardboard cutouts substituting for actual humanoid characters push, pull, and drag the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion.if i had to describe this movie to someone, i'd call it a mutated hybrid of fatal attraction, dumb and dumber, and the three stooges, with a "climax" uncannily similar to the episode of family guy in which the whole family gets into a knock-down fistfight in the living room.advice to benson family: next time you get a new pet, do the poor animal a favor and don't name it fred!

the acting is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way...at all. the writing, the dialogue, and the chemistry between the actors is horrible. nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a mexican soap opera (telenovela). everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. am i the only one who sees this??? to use the word cheesy to describe this canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century. did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air???

so bad as good - not only the script is obvious, but the acting is not just poor, but pathetic. the worst of all is the definition of the characters: unrealistic ingenuity, affected reactions, camera forcing to watch superficial aspects, which are introduced as keys to the plot.can't prevent laughing when, at the end, main character says to second something like 'your daughter plays no soccer and knows no cooking'. such offense to female intelligence defines the level of this film.is the film about the psychological behaviour of the second character?, about its impact on the main character?, or just a sequence of events set in order to heat for the obvious ending? pls, make more of these - i had a good time guessing what next would go wrong...

let me begin by saying that i had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. after finally getting the chance to see it last night, i'm sorry to say that i was incredibly disappointed. it's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's "exorcist: the beginning" look good, but "dominion" does just that. no wait...it makes it look like a great film. perhaps i got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down. after all, the idea that warner bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. plus, i'm a huge fan of stellan skarsgard, and in true fashion he gives a great performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. on the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. clara bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare, and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone, while gabrielle mann's father frances is just ridiculous. the effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. this movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else, and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three-seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper, it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either. i could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers, but frankly i'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things i'd love to say.the saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give...a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past...had huge potential, especially with skarsgard as leading man. unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the harlin version, but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. otherwise, be content with the version first released and move on.

don't get me wrong, i love most of paul schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement i was able to attend at the "rolling thunder" screening at the parisian french cinemathèque with surprise movie on the 17th dec 2004. of course the surprise movie was the exorcist and most people were there for that (i was too). the film was then finished but the score, so p schrader used excerpts from the return of the king and some other movie i forget (was it conan?). anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized. the happy few there (maybe 200 people) were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have jeopardized its chance of getting selected to the cannes film festival. then came the film, then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the festival because of its quality : never in my life had i experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience as people went from being skeptical to plainly laughing out loud at the pity-full spectacle. i couldn't believe how low the author of light sleeper, mishima, blue collar and affliction had sunk.forced over-the-top acting thorough, stupid ending, black and white moral, awful fxs, worst take on christianity from schrader ever, not even suspenseful, just boring as hell (no pun intended) and unsurprising at all! some good locations but sadly miss-used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes! in the end i was 100 times more satisfied by the schrader penned rolling thunder and wished my 2 hours back.don't believe the hype, even the john boorman movie is more exciting and original. oh, and the billy crawford casting, the poor guy does his best, but what where you expecting? he's now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever! i give the movie a 1/5 just because i didn't leave the room, but i should have.

solomon and sheba has come down in hollywood lore not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that tyrone power died while making it. i was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. i didn't know who tyrone power was then, but i learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.i often wonder if ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved. he was the unnamed producer of this as well. maybe he just didn't want to face the critics. good thing power actually went out with witness for the prosecution although you can see him in long shots if you look close. what we have here is a biblical stew that probably would baffle the great solomon himself. several incidents described in the bible that the bible treats separately are woven together into one plot with a few additions tossed in by hollywood. the actual story about the queen of sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the kingdom of israel, chatted solomon up a bit, came back with a lot of trade goods and that was that. the story of a romance between her and solomon is of legend. the ancient kingdom of sheba is about where yemen is now and her people purportedly moved to the african continent which is how ethiopia was founded.the queen never witnessed solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby, nor was she involved with the building of the first temple. nor was she around for the destruction of same. for that matter neither was solomon.and she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when solomon's brother adonijah put in a counterclaim. that is the heart of this film. adonijah upon hearing the news that king david is dying declares himself king. of course david rallies temporarily and says that god came to him and said solomon should succeed him. when david hears about what adonijah did, he says that's what got god all bent out of shape, adonijah being greedy. after that adonijah gets to plotting.things seem to come full circle in that ty power collapsed on the set while dueling with george sanders as adonijah. sanders and power were rivals in many films, most particularly in lloyds of london which was power's breakthrough role. if sanders is not quite the jaded sophisticate he was in samson and delilah, he's still sanders the biblical cad.when power died yul brynner was brought in to play solomon and given a wig so that existing footage of power in long shot could be salvaged. brynner invests the dialog with the proper dignity, but i think he probably regretted doing the pinch hitting.gina lollobrigida is the queen of sheba and she is alluring as a biblical temptress in the cecil b. demille tradition. she seems not to have any real conviction and my guess is she was shocked at power's sudden demise and having to do it all over again. marisa pavan as abishag may give the best performance in the film.the real story with adonijah is not as elaborate as this film. he disputed with solomon for the succession and gathered around a group of some of king david's court as supporters. solomon pardoned them once and then adonijah asked for abishag in marriage. abishag in the bible and here was an adopted daughter of king david in his old age. when solomon hears that, he decides adonijah is getting greedy again and has him killed. the bible mentions someone named berniah who was going around basically doing contract hits on adonijah's supporters.what we have in the film is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that i searched for and couldn't find. it came from the fertile imagination of director king vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note. it was a question of vidor trying to out do cecil b. demille in biblical spectacle. he didn't make it.

right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo. beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful gina. great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love. yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba. george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders. given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role, gina does a good job, though by the time the movie ends, she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa. i guess thunderbolts will do that to you, but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion. the supporting players are mostly awful, lacking credible emotion and timing. the usual big battle scenes, what passed for lascivious dances in 1959, and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of "ah's", but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality. the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play. the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more.

in short this movie was awful.i understand it's a disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. however, i must say this is the worst of all disney movies, with bad acting, lots of irritating shrieking teen girls(my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie. the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store. do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this, no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon.

nothing but the director's juvenile fantasy come to life. this 'movie' is nothing more than an excuse for the director/actor to play kissy face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time of day.the plot is simple, the direction is nonexistent and the movie drags while the actor/director/writer/narrator narrates. don't be fooled by the 'x' rating, there is no nudity and minimal gore.

ah yes, it's yet another retelling of the classic, "sociopathic murderous doctor creates female frankenstein and falls in love".from the same director who brought you such timeless classics as "10,000 maniacs" (no, not the group) and "blood feast", this "unfinished" film virtually cries out for the mst3k treatment. the doctor's assistant even has overtones of torgo from the classic "manos: the hands of fate". i don't know if the graphic, if fake-looking violence or the frequent stretches of dialogue-free tedium could have scared the crew off, though.the main reasons to bother sitting through this movie are for the hysterical 'hypnosis' scene, the laughably serious ending and the rock-bottom production values. i actually watched all of the credits after this movie, for the same reasons you're inclined to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident. that and the sheer genius of the end theme that sounds like a watered down "my favorite things" played on a toy piano. goblin this ain't.

i own this movie. and it is terribly hard to find. it is a unique low budget little gore flick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion. it has the really humourous low budget feel to it, and the gore is suprisingly good for what appears to be a $500 budget. the director is claimed to be the master of gore. i wouldn't go that far, but maybe in his time he was. overall 6/10 on the gore chart.

before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. "constantine"), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la "manos the hands of fate"). now that i've seen "dr. gore" i know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. that will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. a work that is mind-bendingly execrable. anathema.i have hated certain films before, but i've never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its thresh-hold and became self loathing! have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it, but makes you grieve for another hour after that? mystery science theatre disciples beware, this is soul-sucking cinema. go rent "circle of iron" or "the killer shrews" instead.

one of the commenter's is wrong. this is not the only pat patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. he shot a film called the "electric chair" in pineville, nc. he shot this a few years after doctor gore. patterson died in the late 70's. i know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! it sucked also. this was a big deal when the movie came out. no independent horror films were being made in nc. this movie didn't help matters. patterson used to do gore effects for h. g. lewis. he was also good at magic. his gore scenes in body shop were actually well done. the film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11. you can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes. the budget was less that $20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it. only patterson could understand it. still...it's entertainment and it's a classic.

**spoiler* it gives away the very irrelevant ending**at the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, h.g. lewis. he talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. he also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. blood feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 maniacs was a 5 galloner. but, then he goes and claims that dr. gore was a 15 galloner. i want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. watching the movie, i saw very little near 15 gallons. agreed, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but no where near 15 gallons. some of the dismemberment scenes were definitely pretty gory and realistic, strings of flesh and all, but i wouldn't say 15 gallons."end!!! ennnnnnnnndddddd!!!" does that sound familiar? that's what you should have been saying near the last half of this movie. after the igor character was tossed into the acid bath, the movie slowed to a painful crawl. there was no coherent end, as it didn't fit into anything the 90 minutes before it provided. she drove off in a van with a total stranger, big deal! that's what happens when you keep an individual (i won't say person, because she doesn't qualify as a person) very innocent about the world around her. the doctor teaches the girl that a man is to be loved, so every man she meets, she loves.even though h.g. lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting, the directing, or even the gore... i will go with choices a and b. both were terrible!! it was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with shifty eyes as they talk to one person. but, i made it through the movie, and came out stronger. too bad i couldn't say the same after finishing robo c.h.i.c.this was a bad movie. i can usually take my doses of vinegar in good stride, but every once in a while, you get a movie that bites back. i think this movie took off an arm or a leg (haha... *sigh*) admitted, i did enjoy the stare down scenes, where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes really wide and just stared. it was very similar to fuad ramseys in blood feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop, and did not use his power after that. i guess this movie picks up where fuad's powers left off.*final judgement* the movie should have stayed lost. good day-scott-

i know this movie is a low-budget horror movie intended for those in favor of shocks and "inexpensive" gore, but even considering that, this movie is just too dull, filled with an incoherent plot, along with awful music, and obvious signs that this movie was never finished.without giving any spoilers, i'll just say that by the final reel, things are wrapped up with no explantion at all, either by film or narration. the girl anitra is real attractive, but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie.if you are a fan of those gore movies from the 60's and 70's, then you should watch it, but be warned that it does not even reach to the usual plateau of these kinds of movies.

i can't believe i even tried to watch this filth. as an avid b-horror movie fan, i was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker herschell gordon lewis. unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, i could not, for the life of me, think of a worse movie than this. well, maybe gigli, but i firmly believe dr. gore (the body shop) is worse when i think about it. a horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of. however, i will admit to the pure hilarity of a couple scenes when dr. gore is mesmorizing his soon-to-be victims. the camera zooms in on his overly large, bulbous eyes, while the whole time there is this purely putrid soundtrack to add to the amusement. i laughed for the better part of 10 minutes. after he erects his "miracle woman", the movie wastes away nearly 20 minutes just showing him and his "girlfriend" as he is teaching her to speak, then they talk, frolic among marigolds, have picnics, etc. unfortunately, there is only music playing during this whole fandango with no speech whatsoever. this portion of the movie will leave you wishing you had slit your wrists with the dull edge of a butter knife. i almost want to puke at the very thought of this movie. if you like movies that are bad, watch this one.

after the wife of a plastic surgeon dies, he gets his hunchbacked assistant to help him bring her back to life with various parts of other nubile, young, girls. this film wants to be a hersel gordon lewis-type romp, but fails miserably. the acting is beyond bad, the gore effects atrocious (no, not in the good way), the plot almost none-existent and no fun to be had. skip it. you want to know how incompetent it is? at one point you can actually see a movie slateboard quite obviously.eye candy: candy furr gets topless and again in a flashback my grade: fdvd extras: commentary with jeffrey hogue and cynthia soroka, a second feature "how to make a doll"; alternate title sequence with hershel gordon lewis intro; 2 shorts ("quest of the perfect woman" and "maniac hospital"); cover art gallery with music by the dead elvi; trailers for "dr. black mr. hyde", "boots and the preacher"; "the doctor and the playgirls", "the gruesome twosome"; "wizard of gore"; "awful dr orlof"; "wacky world of doctor morgus"; "proffessor lust", "monstrosity"; "fanny hill meets dr. erotico"; and "i, marquis desade" easter eggs: theatrical trailer; a scene from "just for the hell of it"; and a trailer for "axe"

my friends and i have watched this so many time i have lost count. this is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. this film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.you'll laugh as greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. "greg, stop clowning!", scolds dr. brandon. you'll laugh as j.g. patterson gives hand signals to direct greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. and you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with.

the lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film's theme song, a wonderfully demented parody of the (in my opinion horrible) song "my favorite things" from "the sound of music". and this fun little detail isn't the only aspect that makes "the body shop" aka. "doctor gore" (1973) recommendable to my fellow gore/trash fans. the film, which was created almost entirely by j.g. patterson jr., who served as producer, writer, director and leading man as the eponymous dr. gore, is crap, no doubt, but it is also beyond doubt that it is amusing, and that everyone involved, probably patterson especially, was aware that they were not exactly making a masterpiece.dr. brandon (patterson) a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon, looses his beloved wife anitra, a model, in an accident. along with his hunchbacked assistant greg (roy mehaffey), he henceforth kidnaps beautiful young women in order to build himself a new, perfect wife out of their body-parts..."doctor gore" is doubtlessly a film of the 'so bad it's good kind', but it is also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness. mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite horror topics, and, as a matter of fact, it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous gore trash flicks. obviously shot on a minimal budget, "doctor gore" pays some homage to the "frankenstein" films, especially james whale's masterpiece "bride of frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the look of the early troma / herschell gordon lewis gore flicks such as "blood feast" (1963) - only that this looks a lot cheaper and crappier. obviously j.g. patterson's motive was not merely to make a fun gore flick: being a rather ugly, weird-looking fellow, his role of dr. brandon gave patterson the opportunity to make out with a couple of hot, scarcely dressed young women (who would later end up as body-part donors in dr. brandon's laboratory).most of the gore is actually pretty well-made regarding the obviously tiny budget. the dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines ("get that, it might be the door... and put a coat on so they don't see you're a hunchback."). besides the aforementioned theme song, "doctor gore" also includes a wonderfully crappy appearance by a country band called 'bill hicks and the rainbows' - my new favorite band, not. for the rest of the film, i kept wondering whether bill hicks and roy mehaffey, who plays the hunchbacked assistant, are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly the same, and having two unrelated obese, red-bearded guys looking this weird in one film would be a huge coincidence. other than j.g. patterson, most of the cast members never did any other films. this is the first film i've seen out of the few by patterson. sadly, the man died of cancer in 1975.overall, "doctor gore" is a film that certainly isn't for everyone. as a matter of fact, it is total crap. but it is also amusing, and recommendable to my fellow fans of weirdness and cheap camp stuff. dictionaries should show a screenshot from this film under 'trash flick'.

a couple of clarifying comments are in order. herschell gordon lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of doctor gore (aka the body shop), wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with j.g. "pat" patterson, director and star of doctor gore. patterson concocted the "gore effects" for the gruesome twosome and a few other lewis movies in the late 60s. lewis remarks that whereas 2,000 maniacs was a "five gallon" film (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the lewis-patterson productions were "fifteen gallon" pictures. lewis does not describe doctor gore as a "fifteen gallon" film -- he's only talking about the films he & patterson made together. lewis has confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to doctor gore was improvised before he'd even seen patterson's film! so take it with a grain of salt. this may be an "unfinished" film, but like some unfinished novels it does have an "ending." it's just missing some connective tissue. patterson has definite stage presence & a dry sense of humor, helping to make this simplistic show somewhat more watchable than it should be. there's an extremely bare-bones plot -- even blood feast is more complex -- and a gratingly repetitive musical score by william girdler. a bit of nudity & lots of skin. the entire middle section of the film involves the construction of a "perfect woman;" this is concentrated gore for the bloodthirsty, and laughable. patterson the director is in way over his head, but he tries hard to tell his story creatively, if it's possible to use frankenstein clichés creatively. but the best reason to see this film (on something weird's dvd, if possible) is that it features a perfect nashville weeper, bill hicks' "a heart dies every minute." ain't it the truth!

telly savalas put on a passable (but no better than that) performance as pancho villa, the notorious mexican bandit/revolutionary in this account of villa's raid on the town of columbus, new mexico in 1916. villa is not really a historical figure who i'm overly familiar with, so i won't say much about the historical details of the film. as a movie, this isn't great, although it has a smattering here and there of both action and humour. chuck connors' performance as colonel wilcox, commander of the u.s. army base near columbus struck me as a bit over the top, and clint walker as villa's gringo sidekick scotty didn't really do very much for me. the movie is obviously a pretty low budget effort of limited technical quality. for a movie with a runtime of only slightly over an hour and a half i have to say that this movie dragged in places, particularly in the last 20 minutes or so. villa's raid into the united states was an interesting (if, in the overall scheme of things, not especially important) historical sidebar, and probably deserved better treatment than this. 4/10

telly savalas hams it up as the mexican revolutionary (though he's matched by chuck connors as a military martinet) in this jokey yet rather boring pastiche on the famous historical figure's life and times. an earlier attempt, villa rides! (1968) with yul brynner in the role and co-starring robert mitchcum, dealt with these events more soberly and on a grander scale. as such, pancho villa is an all-too typical european venture and an undistinguished one at that, despite its credentials; the end result is more often silly rather than amusing - though a few moments, most notably the action set-pieces and a scene involving a brawl inside a church, offer some mild pleasure. oh, and savalas even gets to sing over the end titles!

this movie was definitely on the boring side. the acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of kenny g and michael bolton. speaking of the soundtrack, i found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a blatant ripoff of paul simon's "you can call me al" - except that they don't acknowledge it at all. isn't there something a little hypocritical there? the scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite. 10 lines? i have to write ten lines about this movie to be included? what a ripoff, i don't think it's too fair to force people to write more than they would just to get it included!

an aging roger moore is back yet again as bond, this time trying to find out why agent 009 was killed, and why he had a forgery of a faberge egg with him, and where it came from. he ends up in new delhi india, then in east germany after finding out about a russian general trying to detonate a nuclear bomb at a circus, hoping nato will push for complete disarmament, so he can take control of western europe, then the rest of the world.despite the way it sounds, this is really more of a romance, i think, between bond and octopussy than an action movie, and longish, but still somewhat fun. but there are way too many attempts at humour in this one; at times it seems like it was intended to be a comedy. also, timothy dalton would have been better than roger moore in this, so there wouldn't have been so much of an age difference between bond and octopussy. useless trivia: the small plane used by bond in the pre credits sequence is now hanging up in a quaker steak and lube restaurant in clearwater/ largo area florida, usa.**1/2 out of ****

i saw roger moore huffing it on the scenes that required running or exercise. he was a james bond who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar telling stories with his fellow british knights. nothing against the elderly in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a frail-looking 58 year old man to be fighting on the wings of planes, hanging off the side of a train, swimming in a swamp with crocodiles, etc.? aside from the fact that octopussy was incredibly silly, vapid, and moronic, the fact that a frail oldster engaged in many death-defying stunts just made it so much easier to laugh at james bond. by 1983 roger moore was clearly looking his age, and he was long past the time when he looked like he could fight with younger men. i saw this movie in the theater, and the howls of laughter were many and very often. any credibility that james bond had built up was gone after octopussy.the only thing missing from octopussy was benny hill and his supporting cast. another low point was that the incredibly lame louis jordan was one half of the axis of evil. jordan helped to make the whole concept even more laughable. and the russian general was a total goof. octopussy works better as a comedy spoof similar to spies like us.even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes done in many other films by better actors. take emperor of the north (1972) where lee marvin & ernest borgnine fought all over the top & bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real.roger moore had a thin, frail body in 1983 and yet his stunt double was clearly a younger, taller, athletic & muscular man. even the hair color did not match. this only made his fight scenes more comedic. the moore stunts looked like those old low-budget chop-socky kung-fu movies, especially with the bad editing. the director seemed to try to make the bad acting and bad stunts better by providing several views of the same stunt. this only accentuated the differences between moore and his stunt double. the fact that the train scenes with moore were shot inside a studio could be noticed from the lighting when moore was in the shot versus the exterior shots of the stunt double on a real train. though many of the bond movies have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt-fights. you can usually clearly see that the bond actor is not actually fighting. overall octopussy has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst of the worst bond movies.

firstly let me get this of my chest i hate octopussy with an absolute passion. what is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill. firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with, just an excuse for moore to tell his corny jokes. next there are several sequences that would make a bond fan cringe,for instance the sequence in which bond turns up to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown. the villains are pretty poor, louis jordon fails to make an impact as kamal khan and bollywood veteran kabir bedi is equally poor as his henchman. it's funny that when people debate over what the worst bond movie is and octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money.

well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (ashley is taller than mary-kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even french, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. lamo. it is also not that bad, not their best. i am a big mary-kate and ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is ok and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again. but hey, when they made this movie they were still new at the whole making their own movie thing. the girls also act like they are older then 13. but if you are a young viewer this is a good movie. not so good if you are older than 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids. then it's ok. good luck mk+a with your future movies!

now, i watched this when i was hungover one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins (one was 11, the other 9). we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just started. my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked. since i was in no fit state to get up, i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film! i have to say, as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films, i actually enjoyed it... it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit, it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. there's always a movie or a show that you don't think you'll like, but for a laugh, you enjoyed it.

this is horrible film. it is past dumb. first, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in 7th grade. not to say i am a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being pretty and popular is not everything. but that is what the twins make it out to be. the plot is even worse. the girl's grandpa just happens to be the ambasitor(sp?) to france. he has a co-worker take the girls around paris and they meet two "cute french boys" with motorcycles. they sneek out to meet the boys start to really like them etc.....they meet a supermodel in process and go around paris with total strangers they think are cute. need i say more? this movie may be cute to 8&9 year olds. the twins play ditsy losers that want boyfriends. it makes sends the wrong idea to girls. the film itself is not great either. i don't recomend this to anyone. i give passport to paris 2/10

just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter mary-kate and ashley olsen movie. this movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical "junior high" experience. they make learning anything at all seem completely taboo. i can't stand the fake french accents, or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually "fall" for the twins. why am i putting everything in parenthesis? because its all stereotyped. the twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. they should be happy they even have a grandfather at all. how does this fit the mary-kate/ashley mold? this one has them fixing up a single guy who (gasp!!) isn't their father!!!!! yes, folks, they actually have a mother who appears for all of five seconds. i haven't even sat through thirty minutes of this and i can already tell how it will end up. this movie is so pitiful, it makes miss usa seem like an academic bowl. really.

this movie sucks so bad. its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained american twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. its just so stupid and so bizarre. how can they just find two french guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? more realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. as for the bit where they make the french president drink 'bad water', that was just lame. i don't think he would have been too pleased in real life. everything worked out too easily for the girls, and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie, if it at all depicted real life.my rating : 0 / 10

oh yes, i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash. i can't say i was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on. no i did it with free will. i deliberately tortured myself. let's go through the fact here folks. - the acting is an insult to humanity. - the plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - the character development is horrendous - the characters that appear in the movie are so clichéd you would recognize them in your average comic book. - the editing is sloppy and unimaginative. - the camera-work is low key. - the dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history. - the directing: well let's say, i bet it wasn't hitchcock.then to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved wath so ever. the director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison to the world. bottom line: passport to paris is one of the worst movies ever made. permanent!

this movie is pretty predictable nuff said....from the delayed kissing scene to the inevitable coming around of grandpa...this is a great movie for the 10-12 age group but beyond that it has no market..i give it 4/10 only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more.

they call this film "euro trash horror". well, it's not horror. the film takes place in europe, so yes, it's "euro". trash? ah yes, it's trash all right.you know you're in for a great movie when, right at the beginning, the dvd gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. expect crackles, odd jarring cuts, and for the movie not to fit the screen. plus there's the sound -- at first i thought i was watching a dubbed film. then, watching the lips carefully, i realized that, no, it's that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of synch.the plot itself is fairly goofy -- an old, disfigured woman named dr bannister kills a scientist for his youth formula. i'm not giving much away because when you see the "old woman" it's pretty obvious she's under a layer of thick, badly applied make-up. anyone with a lick of sense, seeing the fake old age, knows what's coming next.yes, the "old crone" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman -- complete with face make-up and a long wig of hair! zounds!when i say the old woman is disfigured, i mean she has cornflakes glued to her face. the film makes no attempt to explain how the cornflakes got there. for that matter, there is no attempt to explain anything at all relating to any of the characters. they're never developed beyond the level of finger puppets. the two policemen pursuing our anti-heroine just wander about, apparently baffled by the simplest clues. the murdered scientist was working on a youth serum, the old woman has disappeared, and we keep running into a young woman -- how do these pieces fit together?! what does it all mean?! one of the cops sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth. the other smokes a pipe. that's pretty much all we get, character-wise.dr bannister (the crone, now a beauty) goes around wearing odd costumes and then taking them off so we can see her flesh. she has affairs with men. she gets in a catfight with a young woman in a nightgown. she goes to geneva so we can see the lake there. she water- skis a bit, then takes off her wet suit to reveal a strange bead-curtain bikini. she takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume striptease.the ending? well, without giving anything away, it's just a bizarre, tacked on conclusion that makes about as little sense as the rest of the picture. it's the sort of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says, "quick! we need an ending for our movie! what happens next?"the writer mumbles something half awake, and the director runs with it.what's good about this movie? some of the music is campy and fun. that classic 60s organ music that's so corny it's enough to make you laugh out loud. there are some odd seduction scenes, bizarre dialogue, goofy moments. it's very close to being so bad it's good. i did manage to watch it from start to finish without gouging out my eyes or sobbing. i guess that's praise, of sorts.'

i don't know why i even watched this film. i think it was because i liked the idea of the scenery and was hoping the film would be as good. very boring and pointless.

i bought the dvd out of a big bin for $4.99, thinking i'd lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the karakoram mountains, and k2 in particular. fast-forwarding through the film, i reached the climactic scene in which the climbers catch their first sight of ---- mount waddington, towering to all of 13,260 ft, in canada's coastal range. at least one of the several bozos geared up to climb k2 clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like -- he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldn't have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain. given that one of the film's premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on k2, you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts, but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale, while good enough for the likes of reinhold messner, are beneath him. to be honest, i haven't watched the whole thing. what i've seen makes me cringe. they say that you get what you pay for. at $4.99, i've been ripped off.

having enjoyed neil gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in "the dream hunters") in the past, i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. the beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and i loved the sets, the costuming, and helena's artwork. the subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. the dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying. events occurred for the flimsiest reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed. i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so i'm not exactly an authority, but i strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with gaiman's strong written work.

this film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but i am not sure what. i watched it and was very disappointed. it promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. the characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. there are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie. it is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects, not the be all and end all of a movie i agree, but in a movie that is based around them, it's a very important factor. for me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.

this representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. i know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. "the great train robbery" (1903), which i also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.we see little long-haired jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (i guess poor jack attained the wrong kind). jack dreams of a goose (actually it seems to be a chicken) and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven.there is no effort made to be creative in this film. the stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a home with nothing abnormally large in comparison to jack and the climax to the film where jack makes his escape with the goose-chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of screenshot in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place - rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films. the beanstalk (leaf-covered rope) comes trailing down from above and coils neatly on the giants forehead.watch something else.

this is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in social issues - but really haven´t got a clue. the actors - i think all of them are amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can´t save it.worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school. the lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast-translation 2.30 in the morning: "i´m the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual."please!

after watching stop-loss, i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a stinker. gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an american, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. what we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-bush radicals. the story tells of three young men who return home from the war. one descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. the main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time. the third truly is the hero of the story, electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago. what makes this movie bad, is not the acting, but the premise behind it. we are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country. desertion is akin to treason in a time of war, and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie. this paradox is designed to weaken the audience's reaction to the central act of the movie. we are not supposed to find fault with king, since he wears medals, but his actions don't just merit it, but cry out for it. he is not an anti-hero. in order to accept the movie, the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints king as nothing else short of a hero. i cannot accept that, since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day. furthermore, derision for the real hero is heaped upon, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country. i would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of hollywood, as it is a clear example of it. no wonder it fared poorly in the box office.

this is one of those so-called "hollywood social commentary" films that wants to have it both ways. and believe me, in this film, both ways are clichéd and stereotypical. stop-loss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some anti-war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that "if you are a man in today's society, you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies." in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control, a quasi frat party/animal house extravaganza mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed homo-erotic proofs of masculinity. this movie had it all in one scene after another of clichéd imagery. and then rebellious military deserter ryan phillippe goes on a "road trip" with best friend's girlfriend, an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen, maimed soldiers in military hospitals, etc. and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico. but male honor and patriotism win out in the end, as all freshly scrubbed and handsome, he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate. full metal jacket meets sands of iwo jima . but in the end, john wayne rides again! and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its hand.at least it would like to think so. as far as i was/am concerned, just take me back to the more convincing reality of in the garden of elah.

it is unfortunate that between this film, in the valley of elah, lions for lambs, and home of the brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in iraq and afghanistan. the boozing, the fighting, the short-fuses, the broken marriages, guys freaking out and digging a foxhole in their front yard when they're drunk, etc etc etc.does it happen - yes, but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies. i think that it is unfortunate that these directors/producers/writers choose to grind their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way. in this particular film, kimberly peirce didn't even throw us a bone, like showing the new children that were born while a family member was deployed, or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the gi bill, or the couple who can afford a house, or start a new business, earn their citizenship, etc etc etc. instead, we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this film only want to show you the bad side.a couple of issues with the film itself: 1) somebody screwed up by putting phillippe in for a bronze star with v after he led his squad down a tight alleyway after having been baited by a gunman in a taxi. pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) the humvees didn't have any turret armor, so we are supposed to believe it is a near the beginning of the war, yet every soldier and their brother has an acog and every possible attachment for their m4? sorry, don't think so 3) timothy olyphant as a lieutenant colonel? it's hard to believe, but i just checked an he turned 40 in may, so the timing isn't too off. 4) he strikes two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying that he wouldn't return to iraq (upon having learned that he had been stop-lossed). so he's a fugitive. then, when he finally turns himself in at the end, and they take him back, he keeps his rank and deploys with the same unit? sorry don't think so.i can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the army and the infantry. do some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. however, in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes, and really things just aren't like that for most soldiers returning. i wish the director had made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting off with her agenda and then making a film.of the movies i mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best one is probably lions for lambs, which is more a commentary on the sad state of generation y+ than it is about the wars in iraq or afghanistan or the bush administration. if you really want to see this film wait for cable or netflix it, don't pay cash directly to rent it.

i find it terribly ironic that "left wing" hollywood continues to hedge its bets, making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it.if you're a sixties survivor and a committed pacifist, and you're hoping for an all-out condemnation of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front, this movie will really feel like a rip off. none of these soldiers actually question this war, or any war, or the idea of war. they just gripe about having to do another tour.on the other hand, if you're a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really feel like a rip off. none of these soldiers loves america, or even loves the service. the way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys. it's not we were soldiers, and it's not sands of iwo jima. it's not even mindless action, and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffy.ryan philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie. though he's devastatingly sexy, in a rough trade, men's room, bisexual sort of way, it's hard to picture him as a slow-talking' texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted. this is no sgt. croft in mailer's the naked and the dead. he's more like joel in truman capote's other voices, other rooms. he can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit, or that he wants his woman and wants her right now. he fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear.

my mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. that all ended seconds into the film when the "mtv" logo appeared. it might as well been called "national lampoon's sexy-n-loose." and it did play to the "mtv" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. at least disney was smart enough to ship its rated r stuff over to touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. okay, i'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film. however, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. admittedly, i'm not a war movie buff. i can't watch 'platoon,' 'full metal jacket' or 'saving private ryan' more than once. sure they were good movies, but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where i wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next. following a tour in iraq, phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. or, at least, that's the military's plan until he goes awol and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. no, i haven't been in any war, nor to iraq, nor do i agree with it. i also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. i can say this: though i am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict, i can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. it's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the surgeon general's warning on their box of cigarettes and say, "oh, they're what? deadly? i'll sue them!"

over acted, heavy handed, full of speeches, preachy, on the nose, and over stylized in a way only mtv could be guilty of, stop-loss is agit-prop garbage. i expected a lot more with talented young actors such as joseph gordon-levitt and ryan philippe, but screenwriter/director kimberly peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on american youth. i'm sure she did some work researching the iraq war and the young men fighting in it, but you'd never guess it from watching stop-loss. in many ways this mess reminded me of catherine hardwicke's lords of dogtown, an equally inept, overly stylized, tv movie-like waste of solid subject matter.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

the story isn't very strong. don't expect a "bourne identity" kind of movie. it started of strong, tara speaking russian and it even sounded credible. (not that i'm the russian language expert.) moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential, i still believed in it. to bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one. acting was poor, maybe because the story itself was not very strong. there is this part in the movie where gordon patrick (nick moran) is having a conversation on the phone with the c.i.a., like you're listening to a chinese synchronizer. w.t.f!? too bad, the writer didn't even take little effort to give the main characters depth. also, bit of a cheap and easy ending.plus point is almost every scene where tara reid is in. not that she's acting that well, in fact, she doesn't. but she really looks great in this movie. overall, it was a bit of a disappointment. rental material.maybe.

...at least during its first half. if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter film. the second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships, but it's like a dull toothache getting there. also, don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it. she has an important role, but it's a small one.the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of sally (ginger rogers), a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. world war i breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle, yet enlist in the navy anyways. the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian (bill boyd as baltimore) winds up the commanding officer to the other two (robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets). to make matters more complex, sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.the film is a little more interesting on board ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. however, james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby, especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design, or, i should say, the lack of it. in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.in conclusion, if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you've seen everything here worth seeing. the rest is padding.

the threesome of bill boyd, robert armstrong, and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. with the outbreak of world war i, the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar. the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a u-boat. these sequences are lively and well-filmed, but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy-drama with a flat ending. for fans of the stars only.

i generally like sion sono's work, but this movie was completely retarded. but sadly, not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded. i just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. the plot makes only a whisper of sense. i think it was intended to be campy. i mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? but the humor, such as it was, fell flat. not funny. not scary. not gory. i would say perhaps sono was a hired hand on this project, but he appears to have written this boring trash as well. i still need to fill a couple more lines, what else is there to say? i suppose i could finish by saying: better luck next time, sono-san.

what a drawn out painful experience.that's over two hours of my life i will never get back.this film festival director's delight - is awash with overuse of the long slow shot....however - that's not the only thing that makes a script.avoid this movie at all costs.

this self-important, confusing b+w "film" watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip. you're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain. there's no room for plot when you've got "visceral imagery" and "subtle" allegory. to me, it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades. i didn't bring my beret either. watching this, i felt almost insulted since the "film" does such an effective job of distancing itself from you.

first let me say i'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies, i love tarkowsky movies for example, berghman is also a favorite.....but this? the positive points can be summed up easily: the photography is splendid, and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie? i used to think so, but this one is a perfect example of one that (for me) doesn't make it.... maybe it's because i'm too dumb? possible, but i don't think so.... tarkwosky for example also used very long shots, but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and i mean just their heads, because in this movie there are a lot of those shots, but sometimes it is effective), the general result is plainly boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that, while intelligent, is above all very pedantic)you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic, or symbolic effect, but just to spare on budget....i'm very disappointed in this film, because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just went on and on, without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....while reading the very praising comments on this page, i also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty, it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is quite interesting on itself, but it does not make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself....an exercise that, in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching "stalker" or "solyaris" than werckmeister harmonies, that owes much to tarkowsky, but cab never equal it's level....

this movie is a shame especially considering andrzej wajda is not an amateur, but professional director. however this movie fails to deliver anything you could expect.first of all -- i am polish, so i can tell all the background story, because i read books. but how can you tell there is even a war from this movie -- bunch of people are going back and forth, some soldiers are shouting... this is really the second world war or soldiers are on vacations?acting and dialogs -- poor, miserably poor. a.żmijewski, d.stenka, m.komorowska, w.kowalski, a.chyra fit in their roles, the rest of (polish) cast is out of the place (most notably m.ostaszewska, one of the leading characters, what an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogs are not spoken, they are just put there, actors had difficulties to perform and it is no surprise considering what odd things they had to say.and this leads us to the most disappointing issue -- you can't feel it. everything is so theatrical, artificial. there is no real life, there is no feeling in it. there are a lot of original footage from the wwii and, guess what, the material is much more powerful, dramatic, than what a.wajda did.i can see only one positive -- despite historical mistakes (like acronym zsrr; it was made for post-1945 propaganda purposes, to please polish that zsrs was gone, and now there was zsrr, but in 1940 there was no zsrr!), luckily it is undoubtedly shown killing in katyn was done by soviets (yes, it is a fact, not some controversial gossip). great, two hours for 5-10 minutes scene.anyway -- time and potential wasted. this is tragedy of epic proportions, will to fight in 1939 (barely shown), not declaring war against soviet union by polish authorities (sic! not shown here), imprisonment of soldiers shortly after, living in the outrageous conditions (not shown here), hope and fear what will come next (barely shown) , and then... extermination. hand to hand with germans -- soviets were exterminating polish nation, aimed at people who constituted the backbone of poland. unfortunately they succeed, and the results are still visible to this very day.

i'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book. given the number of characters and subplots during katyn, i thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. but really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story. aggravatingly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could have been edited out.in relating the events leading up to the mass-murder of all these intellectuals and officers, i don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary. was it political? philosophical? revenge? the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions. instead, the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons, controlled entirely by stalin, who's appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch. the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely one-dimensional. (are polish people just that angry at the russians?) besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic, choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself. i don't think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on hand-held camera. (but if the director went with a character-driven story, perhaps by focusing on a single family, maybe the handy-cam approach would have worked better.) and if you use really dramatic music, it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made.

oh what a disappointment this movie is. i can't believe it was directed by wajda. there's practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the katyn massacre. the most interesting part comes right at the end, but by that time i simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of "personal immediacy" but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie. instead, the constant jerking of the camera made me seasick. to be fair, there are some great shots too (no pun intended), but nothing that makes you go "wow!".if you're not familiar with the katyn massacre, the movie will leave you scratching your head. if you are familiar, you'll be scratching your head too, although maybe for different reasons. basically, the movie states and restates over and over again that it was the soviets who murdered thousands of polish soldiers in 1940. this point is hammered repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. however, the movie never tries to explain as to why they were killed. after all, tens of thousands of polish soldiers in the other soviet pow camps were not harmed and were released in 1941. it is also never explained adequately how many people perished, although the figure 20,000 is thrown in a couple of times.the acting is adequate with only komorowska (old woman) and chyra (lt. jerzy) giving noticeable performances, but they get to act for maybe 10-15 minutes in total. certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matinée looks rather than their acting abilities, but i won't mention their names. suffice to say that they are definitely not the oscar material, so any claims that this movie was "robbed" of the academy award are simply laughable.the tone of movie is wrong as well. on one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama, on the other it resorts to cheap anti-soviet propaganda such as showing a russian soldier tear up the polish flag and using it to clean his boots. then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot, such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the krakow university.there are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting, such as adding a political angle to the story, or showing the german discovery of the graves, or even portraying anna's trip from the soviet occupied part to the german occupied krakow. all of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie, but instead they're reduced to a couple of minutes. in the end, we get a collection of loosely fitting, confusing, boring scenes about the reaction of poles to one of their greatest tragedies of wwii. not very compelling and not worthy of wajda at all.

first of all, let me say that i am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. i am polish and i have been aware of the katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so i was looking forward to this film. unfortunately, i was disappointed.i think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. the characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning. in my opinion the cast doesn't really have a chance to show their ability. the exception is andrzej chyra, portraying jerzy - the only interesting character. i wish the story was more focused on him.as a result, the film lacks emotion. before seeing it i thought i would be moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact i was watching it with an odd sense of detachment throughout, except for the final execution scene. it is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending, although the idea of the lord's prayer being recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far-fetched.to conclude, i suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events, but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema.

i bought this because it was $1.99 and harry carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it, and for $1.99, how bad could it be? then i read some comments here on the film and began to get excited -- maybe this really was a lost gem, one of those terrific little b-movies everyone had forgotten about but which deserved to be resurrected. wrong! i'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it got from some quarters here, but i found it one of the most tedious and blatantly bathos-filled movies i've ever seen. and i'm not talking about richard carlson's hokey texas accent (straight from the georgia part of texas, i guess). it's just dumb. no one in the film behaves like a real human being. no one. and no one does anything believable or interesting. it's not even a cliché-fest. it's just 80-something minutes of frames going by. it even managed to make harry carey, maria ouspenskaya, and c. aubrey smith boring. now that's unbelievable.

this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least. the basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it. the two whom show up fall in love. the 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out. okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together..slightly weird here...harry carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick. i mean really, make up my mind i can handle it. then there is richard carlson playing james houston from texas....hmmmmm, he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas. this one isn't even close.. then we take the 3 ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping out...in fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge.. silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of character..you can avoid this one..

i can see what this film was intending to do. unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal. the "reality crime" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. in fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way. notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and the father tying flies. on occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog. instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book. but the real problem lies in the editing. the story does not flow. it fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts. in the end you are confused as to what is actually happening. those who like this sort of detective movie like to follow along, piecing together the puzzle at the same time the lead characters do. with such poor editing it is difficult if not nearly impossible to do this.

i find it amazing, that so many people (probably poles) have voted for this movie, giving it such grades (mostly tens). ok, the movie was fine, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. the only good thing about kiler is the dialogues, rather not comprehensive for non-poles. screenplay is primitive, the acting (except for jerzy stuhr as ryba) - awful. it's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. p.s. the sequel "kilerow 2-och" ("2 kilers") is on the way and it's just the same story.

this movie was absolutely terrible. the only explanation i can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. it was actually painful to watch this movie. even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. as far as i know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. it's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said, "hey! let's make a movie. who wants to be in it?" it's that bad. besides luke perry, who is only in a small part of the movie, i did not recognize a single other actor. that's not necessarily a bad thing but it is in this case. i liked sandlot (i) and i generally like stupid and silly movies but this movie doesn't have a single redeeming quality. the people who wrote it don't have the slightest clue as to how children think, talk, or act and the movie is a disjointed mess of terribly corny lines and stupid jokes. i rarely write negative reviews but this is the worst movie i have seen since man's best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies i have ever seen in my life. if you rent it, remember that i warned you. the fact that some people actually rated this movie as being good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence. i'm not exaggerating.

first off, this movie is not near complete, my guess is that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the script.the movie contains bizarre time-travels without notice, inconsistent dialogs, misplaced details all over, the music isn't very bad at all, other then misplaced tracks, and besides the fact that the volume goes up and down between the different tracks. the cutting-room did a descent job actually, and that says a lot. missplaced sound effects ruin the tension, though.luke perry does what he does best, just looking worried, and occasionally coughing up punchlines from hell.i seriously rate this movie as the worst of 2007, and i've seen a few bad ones. do not spend money on this one, it's not so bad it's a laugh, it's worse. ratings above 1 star, should render a blacklist at imdb, because it's a damn lie.

just in case the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage.short review? yeah.i decided to spend as much time writing this review as hollywood probably decided to put into the script. i doubt it'll be published considering how poorly i worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first sandlot movie. it completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. the sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.

i gave this a 2, and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh. the film is excruciatingly boring, and incredibly cheap. it's even worse if you know anything at all about the fantastic four.

i am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life. i'm not a huge fan of the fantastic four, but i'm fairly familiar with them. in 1994, roger corman (b-movie legend) produced the first, i think, feature length fantastic four film. the result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release. still, copies exist, mostly on the net and at conventions. if you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing out.the film basically retells the ff's origin and an encounter with doctor doom and a villain named the jeweler, essentially the mole man with a penchant for petty larceny. as is the case with these comic book movies, everything has to tie into everything, so the ff play a vital role in dr. doom's creation, and he and the jeweler play a vital role in theirs.first, i'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie, i actually sort of liked the guy that played doom. he doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does he hits them. the armor looks pretty good too.as for the rest...it's a dirty, dirty mess. bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything basically. boos especially to jay underwood, bringing new meaning to the word overacting as johnny storm. he's not overacting, he's ultracting.as for the ff, well they all sort of look right, and sue's played by a very attractive actress, but they just don't seem like a real team. for one thing they have no reason for sue and johnny to go into space. in an early section ben and reed go to visit the two, johnny's like 8 and sue's about 12. it only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier. the thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the human torch is really a human torch he looks like the silver surfer tinted red.i could type for hours, but i think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned not-so-human torch. he's racing a laser beam, and he eventually destroys it with a punch. yes, a punch. a laser beam. with a punch. then he flies around and goes "yippeee!" a whole lot, whereupon the camera tilts down and he flies back toward earth. evidently reed the intellectual forgot to inform johnny that fire doesn't exist in the vacuum of space. this and many other scenes operate like looney toones, if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff, they don't fall.i laughed, i cried, i was glad it was never released.

when hulk hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before dvds of the old incredible hulk tv show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. we saw a similar occurrence a year prior when spider-man cartoons appeared on dvd to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.so the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of wal-mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. i guess everyone involved would just rather forget. to be fair, the fantastic four is not as bad as everyone says. let me rephrase that. it's not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggest.veteran television actor alex hyde-white (no, you don't remember any of his roles) leads the way as reed richards, the brilliant scientist who, along with his crew, gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap. he's left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths. his future wife, sue storm (rebecca staab), can suddenly turn invisible, while her brother, johnny (jay underwood), may now ignite himself at will. then there's poor ben grimm (michael bailey smith), the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy, orange rock.just as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this, they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos. it seems reed's old colleague victor von doom (joseph culp) is living up to his name, and that villainous jeweler (ian trigger) isn't exactly helping old ladies cross the street, either. can our heroes save the day? of course they can; like any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when.what's striking about the fantastic four is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. the dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. the acting is so unpolished it makes a third-rate afternoon soap opera look like shakespeare. the special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget, but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. when the human torch fully ignites his body, for instance, the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon. i can just hear that production meeting. "oh, no one will notice. they'll be too intrigued by the action!" i mean really, a cartoon? at least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string! prior to that, the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens-in-the-backyard fare. the crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely-spaceship-like object on fire. that's the only remnant of such a major disaster?of course there wasn't a whole lot to work with in the script. there is a fairly coherent story here, but it's all so simplified. when reed and ben decide to go into outer space, they simply drop by the storms' house and ask if they'd care to join them. is it really that easy? don't these sort of things require, oh, i don't know, years of training and expertise? not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in full house reruns. but as bad as that may be, nothing can compare to how painfully clichéd dr. doom is. he was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s, right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks. no comic book, least of all fantastic four, has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional.ultimately, the fantastic four is saved from being a complete turkey because it's just so damn innocent. you can tell the people involved, as little talent or experience as they had, really tried. they didn't know the final result would be so embarrassing. they were under the impression that this was their big break, that people would flock to the theaters. it bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with (and i'm sure half of that was eaten up by the cool thing costume). all things considered, they did well, and for its many flaws, the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans.

i never read the book. now i don't really want to. i had no clue what this movie was about when i walked into the theatre. i still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but i do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. two precious hours i can never get back.the storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. werewolves...or something...a very romeo and juliet type plot. i predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. and i was correct.the acting isn't horrible. the only two cool characters in the movie were the british cousin guy and the rambo-graphic-novel duder. the other characters are too...the dialogue is very bland and predictable.the absolute worst part of the movie is the transformations between the "humans" and the "wolves." if you wanted something kick-ass like van helsings, you're gonna be really upset. imagine ballerina's, a bright light, then a wolf. yep...that's about it.just avoid this movie. period. especially if you've read the book, because you'll just wanna punch babies.

i'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. first is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. the second is from someone who has.(movie without book) from a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. nowhere near as good as either of the underworlds but much better than ultraviolet. and i'm not just talking plot line either. the visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice. the characters has very little development and vivian didn't even seem to truly care that her "love" was killing off what was left of her species. some of the other characters could have had more air-time, like the five. the plot was way to similar to underworld for my tastes.(movie with book) as many have stated, other than the title, character names and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. in the movie, gabriel was a lot older and was the father of rafe (thus astrid was once his mate). in the book, gab was about 24, never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life (astrid is trying to win his affection) and astrid was the mother of ulf, not rafe. another important thing is the location. the book took place in riverview, maryland. also, why they moved from west virginia is very different. the movie has it being vivian's fault and her entire family was killed due to it. in the book, the original leader of the five, named axel, killed a girl from their school. hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (viv's father included), forcing them to move. also, viv's mom, esme was a major character.one thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the "bitch's dance". for those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the males). vivian won it, trying to save her mother from astrid (who is a horrid evil woman in the book) and thus was supposed to mate with gab. there was no prophecy! anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, i highly suggest not seeing this film.

***may contain spoilers****i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my friends. i couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. but as soon as the movie started, i couldn't believe how different it was. at first i was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. but then came the rest of the movie. by the time it was over i was furious. nothing was correct but their names and the fact that vivian fell in love with aiden. by the end of the book, gabriel was my all time favorite...and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot?! the movie also showed the shifters, or werewolves, as these vile, evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe. they would never kill humans for the fun of it.if they wanted to make a movie like they did, they should have given it a different title and named the characters different. because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it, but when i think about it all i can see is the bad. you couldn't pay me to go see it again or buy it.

from the makers of underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen. it is basically a reconstructed version of underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a big deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). a twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named vivian is currently residing in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves. there, she belongs to a small society (or pack) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly wed the pack leader, gabriel, whose son - some toad with a british accent - takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack. they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention, so of course, such activity is considered forbidden. vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood-thirsty predators. when they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted - giving the pack a chance to transform into their "wolfy" selves. all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf. very cheezy effects. the entire movie is like a tamed down underworld with some drippy, romantic montages and very little action. watching this in the theater, i could not wait for it to end. a devastatingly boring disappointment. avoid!

ok, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. when i'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book i turn to to fill in the time. i have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! they could have done a little better than this. i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies. they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly i'm tired of watching it. i mean hello the best part of the whole f*****g (sorry) story is she ends up with gabriel. he doesn't die. what was that about? and he's old in this movie. gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da** it. awww. and astrid who the he** came up with the idea of astrid being vivian's aunt no no no no. astrid and vivian hate each other. awwww. anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pi**ed off. hope this helped.

one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their "love" of each other. they don't seem to be interested in much but each other, and only passively so. i was left feeling shut out. most of the exterior scenes take place at night, so one can't even enjoy well-lit sights of paris! i gave up after an hour and ten minutes.

this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend. from then on, she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends: jack during the day and joseph during the night.this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget. the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture. there are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances. the wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have much to do, as the actors wear very down to earth clothes, and actually most of the time they are naked anyway.the film is very dialog heavy, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. however, the dialogs sound too composed and awkward. in the beginning of the film, most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says 'me too'. after the frenzy of agreement, the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad.the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful.this film is a great disappointment.

i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish. akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than paris at night?). the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to egon schiele's angst ridden self portraits. yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good goddard and truffaut really are.

this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb. armand assante, once again doing a poor stallone imitation, is ray wellman a ex-con just out on parole. all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy, played by a young marcia gay harden, back. unfortunately for ray, lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot, played by sam neill. further complicating matters is that ray's old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen. ray and elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.what follows is violent and slow, but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future, she's not as polished here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching. almost.rent "fever" (no the title doesn't fit the film) if your a fan of hers, otherwise skip it and be grateful it's stars went on to better things.note-this is a hard "r" flick for language, violence and nudity.

i was expecting "born to kill" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after "dillinger" (an overrated movie but at least better than this). claire trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal, and the action (such as it is) stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling. it's one of those movies in which the supporting players -- notably elisha cook, jr. (whose character's homoerotic itch for tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script) and isabel jewell -- out-act the leads. it also doesn't help that, nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in "psycho," tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have "psycho" tattooed on his forehead. also, there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called "deadlier than the male" -- but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. "born to kill" is a real disappointment from robert wise, who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career.

fellow giallo-fanatics: beware and/or proceed with caution  for this movie isn't exactly what it appears to be. it surely looks like a giallo, with its juicy vhs cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife), rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast (john phillip & fernando rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot. the version i watched is presumably harshly censored  with a running time of barely 77 minutes  but then still there's a severe lack of suspense, character development and most of all sadistic (and typically giallo) carnage. "eyes behind the wall" can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues. it's an interesting effort notwithstanding, because writer/director giuliano petrelli (his only film) clearly attempted to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame. inspired by hitchcock's "rear window", the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound writer. he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road. the tenant, respectively, likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires. wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. then, there's also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. are there any normal characters in the story? well no, of course not! the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography, but none of it ever leads anywhere so it's all just sleaze & sex without significance. there's a truly bizarre twist/revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality. not recommended to fans of italian horror/cult cinema, but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students, to analyze the characters freud-style.

i'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice. the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. the script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why vidal tried to disown it). the direction is worse. most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the "uncut" version). the cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. the movie should've looked a whole lot better. the overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an x-rated movie (guccione called it "paganography") wears thin after the first hour after peter o'toole and john guilgud exit. bob guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid-79's bbc production of i, claudius instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-louise, look somewhere else.

i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. the scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting (tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. john gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet. the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played macro was handsome. the guy who played claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of nero and was certainly at odds with robert graves' picture of claudius. the climactic (?) assassination of caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the domus flaviana that still exists today. there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions. if you want history, read suetonius or tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch passolini's "salo", but by all means stay away from this movie.

"caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "fellini satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the "glory" of ancient rome. but fellini it ain't... first of all it is not as entertaining. far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced mcdowell in the titular role. his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. the portrayals by jay robinson in "the robe" (1953) and david cain-haughton in "emperor caligula" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. as it is, they are little more than cyphers. one example is the role of macro, played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.

probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . what do people mean by hard core sex ? the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring traci lords and " big " john holmes ? well anyway this is really poor film , i doubt if i`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . the script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . it truly is an absolutely awful film. you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . yes you read that right , a film set in roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !trivia point. many years ago a pirate copy of the thing ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of caligula meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of caligula of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts . this led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . but having seen the whole of caligula i don`t know what it meant either
