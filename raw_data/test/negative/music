oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. don't really expect hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry "d" student able to outsmart only stupid people. and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called "victims"3/10 just expect this one in the daily funnies.

there are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. the last slumber party is one of those. i hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. i have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. it is the prime example of how in the 80s, any movie could get released.our killers name is maniac randles. (scary, huh?) randles is an escaped psychopathic killer running around in doctor's scrubs and a doctor's jacket hacking off people with a scalpel as he goes along. he ends up coming across a house of girls that are having a slumber party. one of the girls is the daughter of the doctor that tried to operate on randle's, and randle's ended up pulling him down in some kind of sexual position. (lol just watch the movie to know what i am talking about.) now i know what you must be thinking at this point: this must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like slumber party massacre, or valentine's day massacre, right? no! this movie is horrible! first off, the quality of the film changes off and on throughout the film. sometimes it will look like it could have been filmed this year, but other times it is so grainy and blurry that it isn't even watchable. the funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not care at all.the director played the killer (as if that wasn't funny enough) but because of the fact that he wasn't talented enough to act and direct at the same time, he just filmed one shot of him walking toward the camera with his scalpel, and then just replayed that clip over and over every time someone is killed.the characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikable, and these people who are suppose to be ages 16-18 look more like they are 25-45. i know that slasher films commonly use adults as teenagers, but i have never seen a movie where it was this obvious. my guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they have all died of old age... or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and that is a good thing because i highly doubt that they could have gotten into any more movies even if they tried. all i can do is hope that tyler will one day make the last slumber party 2: the final conflict and have all of the original actors return. i'm sure everyone would love that.the movie was directed by stephen tyler, (no, not the singer) who never went on to direct again, and it was released by b&s (which i am sure stands for bull and ****) productions. bull&s only released one more film, "forever evil," which was pretty awful, but not near as bad as last slumber party.a horrible, horrible, horrible film... highly recommended.

this one's a doozy. dating from 1949, scene of the crime often plays more like a coen bros. movie set in the 1940's and filmed in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche here isn't quite so well-tuned -- maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to oscar-baiting schlock like road to perdition. frankly, it's a wonder that this film isn't considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere, considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance ( much like the grandaddy of all such "fake art" films, citizen kane, or anything by murnau. ) mgm is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes, and i think any story, any atmosphere, even "gritty realism," can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization. you could say i'm a disciple of the minnelli school. but it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough-guy dialogue of the dashiell hammett stripe, a willingness, perhaps, to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like "careful, mr. wiggly, or you'll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with." i made most of that up -- "mr. wiggly," unfortunately, made the cut -- but believe me, the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs. even the lead cop's wife played by arlene dahl speaks like she has a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the christian name rocco. by the time van johnson turns in his badge with the line, "i'm sick to death of death and homicide," you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices -- in this case, zeugma -- could ever have been misconstrued as "street." for those who have outgrown the naked gun series, this is the funniest cops-n-robbers film going.

okay, now i know where all those boring cop/homicide tv shows came from. i do believe they can be traced back to this movie. "scene of the crime" feels more like a tv episode, or an episode of a serial. complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.i like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall i found this movie dull as i'm not a fan of the genre. i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case ...something about bookies and informers. and oh yeah, there was a stripper, played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven. what i want to know is: why did she keep calling van johnson "uncle wiggly"? wasn't uncle wiggly a rabbit? a character from a children's book? what the heck does that have to do with anything? i guess i just don't get tough-guy film noir-ish kinda jargon.in fact, much of the dialogue made me mutter "nobody talks like that!" however, i could relate to one scene where the cop's wife (arlene dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life. yeah, i know that feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them, that there's a constant fear for their safety. so there are moments of truth in this film, underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self-consciously to be gritty and real, that it actually seems unreal to me.a little background: this movie was made when dore schary took over mgm from louis b. mayer, and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great. dore schary was determined to bring more "realism" to movies. i kinda hate dore schary. maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious, bleak movies being made today, wallowing in the ugly "truths" about life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity rather than the best. no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii.well, damn it, we still need that kind of distraction today! there's still plenty of depression and plenty of war. and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape? trashy, brain-deadening reality tv. thanks a lot, dore!

i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information: score 6,7, well... not so bad. genre: scifi...good i like scifi. so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it. but but...no.as in summary, this isn't a movie at all. it is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. movie starts with a epic abduction story: driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... well, actually that was the film. last of this ..ummm... frankly i don't know what to call it...was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement. quite a same stuff what these tv-preachers tell you, but they are "good" at it.honestly, if you wan't to see a scifi movie or something with ufos, please stay far away from this "thing". it has nothing to do with them. if you want to hear some cuckoo head's opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do. then go ahead and watch this "thing", but i still prefer going to the church at sunday.this is complete bull. (and evangelical christian propaganda, as another users said= well... i should have red another users comments before i got the movie. (27% of voters have rated this "thing" as 10. yeah, right. please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)

christian propaganda...lots of fear mongering...this is not scifi, this is chrifi (christian fiction).the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn. from then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . the ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction, instead of god taking all the christians to heaven. no reason to repent if its aliens. the deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.

this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series. i did not know it would be a bible-thumping movie. i expected it to truly be a movie about ufos and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. as previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. i felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones. if you go to church, it'll probably be shown there for free some time. other than the cover-up of its true subject matter, the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned. but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained, but preached to.

"yesterday" as a movie, is hard to rate. the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. the story is gritty and real and does not compromise. but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.as a person who was born and raised in central africa, i appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu. but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film. it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of "yesterday". unlike the 1980 film "the gods must be crazy", which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology, "yesterday" has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience. the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind - and i doubt it was intended for the western mind. the scenes are long and slow, the editing is not paced for a 60mph+ instant gratification world. the dialog is not cleaver or witty, it is real. movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment, it is education.this movie is best viewed by those who know, appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub-sarah africa. if you lack a broad enough world-view to understand other cultures, especially african cultures, should skip this film. do not waste you time with it. go see "talladega nights" or "larry the cable guy" instead for your cross culture viewing.i give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures. for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world, i would give it a 7.

i'm pretty sure poe would have considered this a travesty. the first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. and then there's toby dammit. what on earth was fellini thinking? it's a rambling, random, dull piece, with little to recommend it. one should feel frustrated at the lack of backstory or conclusion, but there's only relief that it's over.

what is it about the french? first, they (apparently) like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does. second, they (seem) to like edgar allan poe's work more than just about anyone else does. it's got to be the "beaudelaire effect".don't get me wrong...i'm a poe fan myself. but this trilogy manages to make three of poe's below-average stories into...well, i'm not sure what they're made into."toby dammit" is a fine fellini film, but it has nothing to do with poe's story, at least in terms of theme. it's enjoyable on the first viewing. terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role. however, it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead."metzergenstein" is a big mess. how did vadim's films get produced? it's just awful...not even up to amateur film school standards. depending on the dvd menu you have, try to skip it and save your time."william wilson" is actually the segment that is most faithful to poe's work. it does not have much style, though, even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film. (it looks like the boys are throwing tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs, that have been rolled up into balls.) my advice is to skip "metzergenstein", watch "william wilson", and then, if you're a fellini fan (i'm not) keep "toby dammit" on while you cook dinner or make a snack.

it's reassuring to see that other imdb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great vadim, malle and fellini.these directors may be talented & artistic in their own right; however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as *in any way* related to edgar allen poe's stories, they exposed themselves as frauds. either (a) they didn't bother to read the poe stories, or (b) they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn't pay poe any mind.imagine if metallica plugged in their guitars, cranked the amps up to 11 and moshed out 3 chords claiming it to be beethoven's 9th symphony. that's the feeling you'll get after sitting through this film. if you're a vadim/malle/fellini fan (metallica), you'll dig it. if you're a beethoven fan (poe), you'll puke.metzergenstein...here we begin with a bizarre porno version of poe. ok, "porno" may be a bit extreme haha, but at the very least you have to call it a barbarella version (including, i don't doubt, some of jane's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp). vadim falls into old clichés of his own: the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow-cam we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. cute stuff, but "metzergenstein" ain't the place for it. and in addition to the barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, jane fonda's awful american accent and unconvincing performance as a european countess made this the worst casting since julia roberts in that lousy version of dr. jekyll & mr. hyde.william wilson...here's a great poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. if you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, go watch star trek episode #27 "the alternative factor". but here, malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on... any guesses...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. ho hum. brigitte bardot's role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end, and once again the director distorts a classic poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues. do it on your own time, malle. i thought we're here on poe's dime.toby dammit....the absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film i've seen since "staying alive". at least fellini showed some tact in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humour of the story is so vast, i wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies, stamped "edgar allen poe story" on it and submitted it to this collection. i strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with poe's works, but there was absolutely none.the original poe story ("never bet the devil your head") is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims "i'll bet the devil my head..." on a foggy morning, the devil takes him up on his offer. the result is the sickest and silliest thing you've ever read. this was poe, the comedian, at his finest (yes, poe wrote many comedies. also check out "a predicament" and "devil in the belfry" if you want a taste of his witty, satirical works).this fellini version? it's bland, soulless, and not funny at all (unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes). here fellini's egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. most of it is set at an awards ceremony where fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic "sour grapes" attitude that we find in all fellini films dealing with cinema. note the sarcastic jabs at "the critics", a recurring theme in fellini's films. for someone who considered himself above the critics, fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them. at any rate, i feel like fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1/2, spliced them together and sold it as a poe story. worst "adaptation" ever.i think i put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a poe movie.

i saw this film in the movie theater. i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. it is a woodward film about one of second city's native sons.everyone knew about johns history. everyone knew how he died. some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.but hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.this movie. well. forget the idea of poor michael chilklis (who is a really great actor) being in a really astonishingly bad film, and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man.forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of belushi's work...and all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie.screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob woodwards work. kinda saying "okay...we are about to mess with belushi...now lets go after woodward too..." they also decided to take the premise of it's a wonderful life and turn it into it's a horrible life on crack.is he a guardian angel or the devil? is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device...how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie? it is one of those movies after it is over...you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go "what the hell was that?!" in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic. but for good reason.a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw out snappy one liners) to the screen. a cult film is never good. and most people would never watch them in any serious context.if you want to watch some classic bad late 80's fair stoned? rent wired. if you want to know about john belushi...you can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie.

this could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! i had this film when i was a theater manager. when i put the film together, and watched it, i thought i had some reels out of order. as it turned out i didn't, and if i did, nobody would have noticed. i couldn't figure out what's going on! everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way!

"wired" would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen. the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and i'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film.it fails to work either as a tribute to belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. a pointless mess with no redeeming features.

in bollywood it isn't rare that worthless films become hits, good films flopping and good actors not making it bigaks is such a moviehimesh after a music director and singer tried acting hell man, just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actorthe producers were sure the film will work perhaps, the songs were a hit too and of course himesh did his cheap publicity as usualthe film tells such a poor story, such poor direction, such poor acting it makes you cringeindian rickshaws in germany, stunts by himesh and lot of stupidity himesh's cap is intact even when he is in the car which somersaultsdirection is poor music is saving grace though most songs sound the samehimesh tries hard but sadly his emotive scenes are a joke, lacks expressions, he is best suited for his music director and some singing he cuts a sorry picture hansika is awful malika is okay sachin khedekar is okay, darshan jhariwala hams

agreed this movie is well shot,but it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made 2 hours seem like 3 just over a small love story,this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the o.c,in short please don't watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you up from you're sleep,i gave this movie 1/10 cause that was the lowest,and no this is not based completely on a true story,more than half of it is made up.i repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10,but the movie is just a little too much,the actor's nasal voice just makes me want to go blow my nose.unless you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge no-no.

i have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and i must say that i never felt that bad, which i felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very bad. there were songs & songs. nobody should watch this movie. the director has shown germans speaking english which is so rubbish. germans does not speak english. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked himesh for autograph. (obv that he must have gave some money to her) in the promo they have shown prepare for laughing riot. but i could say there was only one scene where that himesh was laughing for no reason may be he thinks he's funny. hansika is very good. she is like an angel. but too young only 16 yrs old. if you have plenty of time and don't know what to do then you should watch this movie or else its waste of money

whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? only hope this is first and the last as well, for god's sake ! from assalam valekum to gayatri mantra, himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. why does himesh not smile ? simple, because he does not use close up toothpaste ! now there this friend of his, tailing him around every where, and this number one lawyer in the town, who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce himesh, of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier, perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate, for destined to deal with the stiff, unattractive lot, every day ! the action scenes are so funnily shot, like the event planner attacked by the thief, autos riding over the cars, so on and so forth. the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off, that he flies to and fro around. most hypocrite, he praises hr for distributing love among people of the world, as if they were sweets , and on his back, coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men. when himesh is proved innocent, he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy, as if it's a game of musical chair ! i didn't get to se the poor guy's face even, did you ? hansika in the role of ria, looks as if she is in need of an eye check up, for strain in her eyes ! the fellow in the role of a friend is good, who has acted quite naturally, and should be in better movies, like sharman joshi, for example. child artist in trishu's brief appearance is sweet, but wasted. it seems today's young generation has gone nuts , since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores , and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. this is a weird taste in music, and rather funny. i am surprised, how such classic lyricists like gulzar , have opted for himesh of all the people, to give music. there is story in panchtantra , that a crow attachés so many feathers of a peacock, to look beautiful, and appeal to the birds; but the feathers fall off ultimately, and the real dark crow is revealed ! hope himesh takes a hint, and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff, and wasting precious money, which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much ! his friend does tell him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing ? thanks for showing us germany, himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd ! and correct those spelling mistakes, will you ? an extra e in movie, and no e in love ! there is also a famous number from the old film sholey, mehbooba, on which mallika sherawat wiggles, once again, but this time with himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, ria , his so-called real love, and his new bride is not around ! now that was very clever, himesh ! at least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly, to justify sherawat's presence . but doesn't she look a bit washed down ?

if you feel reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. his face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. this is way far from a real love story (get the spelling right, reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, himesh getting imprisoned, himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ... if you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this one, especially the scenes where he howls in mehbooba. if you despise the nasal twangs, and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of reshammiya can do to you, then don't miss this movie.i couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the very end. the only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography, locations, and a couple of the songs. even then, until you are a die hard reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.

one of the most awaited movie!i thought himesh will do a bit of acting but alas all my hope went wrong..given that the heroine is 15 yrs old!!!!omg!!what did they thought before considering the actress..may be its because no boby wants to work with hr(as he is called in the film,(human resource as many people wrote in mazagines!)nevertheless it was a disappointment.i hope the producer doesn't make himself bankrupt by making a part 2 of this as this news is roaming around...the story was predictable one with himesh showing his generosity character throughout the movie which i doubt very well.anyways..the movie is good from those people's angle who thinks himesh cant do anything wrong. >>4 out of 10<<

first things first, how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this. i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head, what exactly is director trying to say.if its a thriller, there are no thrills, if its action, there is no action barring a chase sequence, there is no drama, and the much touted love story, it actually never takes off. no passion, emotion nothing is there.actually i never expected wonders from the movie, however after the bumper opening it took, i thought of giving it a chance. i have no problems with himesh reshamiya whatsoever, and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity. i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one.let's not put the blame of himesh reshamiya, he is just a debutant actor. but direction, screenplay, writing, makeup, everything has gone for a toss.himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve. he can do the don kind of roles. hansika is just a kid, and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks.the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie, i don't know his name, but he looks promising.watch it at your own risk, not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing.** strongly recommend to avoid this movie.**

i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. where do i start, it's a complete mess. the main attraction of course was the soundtrack. which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what himesh does best. but as they say, don't give up your day job - hr definitely shouldn't.hr's acting is plain and simply awful. even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there. two words of advice to hr - give up acting and secondly, use chapstick.hr has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him. as for malika sherawat - just the same old bollywood vamp crap. you can package the product as much as you want, but if there's no substance it won't hold. don't waste your money...

ego. seems it's the only reason this movie was made. this movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it. every character was only good at self praise and lead actors (i use this term liberally as has the director) emote in the likeness of stone. the little story, if that, fails on the basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. direction leaves much to be desired. blatant flaws are all over the place (character motives aren't defined, prospective husbands are found overnight, broken car windows mend themselves among other things)let's face it, himesh can't act. neither, it seems, can hansika motwani. in her defense, she's still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make-up. raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much. the actor who plays himesh's friend is the only natural. a few questions do come to mind: how can such a film cost rs.500,000,000?? where did the money go??? granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind. (including 3 mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car)the good: himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark "topi." let's give the devil his due: himesh, as usual gives good music.the bad: direction, story, himesh's singing is still hard to ignorethe ugly: dialogs and everything else!!!final word: painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghai's "yaadein"

frank tashlin's 'censored' is a so-so private snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the south pacific but the censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. these early scenes are the best, with the unseen censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! the second half of the cartoon, in which snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy, first class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only-a-dream finale. the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! aimed at the military, the snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic i've come across in any of these shorts thus far. despite all this, i prefer the snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. for great examples of this, seek out tashlin's 'the goldbrick' or chuck jones's 'spies'. 'censored' is fairly weak by comparison.

how unfortunate, yet also fortunate, that two films about pot-holing -the cave and the descent - should arrive at much the same time. sadly for the descent its release in the uk on 7th of july coincided with the very day of the london underground tube/metro terrorist atrocity that killed almost 60 and injured hundreds - not a particularly good night/weekend to pop out to the cinema, especially to see a scary-as-sheesh film about likable women being trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic underground caving system. the two movies have virtually the same elements - a half dozen or so characters, lost in a previously unexplored caving system, with no-one outside aware they are trapped down there. lots of water, caverns, danger... then ultimately some vicious human-like or human-derived creatures determined to prey upon them. where the two are so different is that the cave is unreal, entirely unbelievable, more alien-esquire sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror, or drama. the comparatively minuscule-budgeted british film (filmed in southern england though set in the appalachians) is five-pair-of-pants terrifying, a heart-stopping shocker so stomach turning that people walk out of screenings early in shock. it knocks off the girls in any old order - you genuinely have no idea what to expect next - surely not her! the descent is also lit in naturalistic manner, making it all the more scary, unlike the laughably lit cave which resembles a giant magical christmas santa's grotto, with cathedral-sized room after room dazzling in gloriously blue light from... who knows where, while the cavers torches are employed exclusively in artistically lighting up the granite-jawed heroes (each more puppet-like than any team america / gerry anderson / thunderbirds creation). fantastic amounts of equipment are carried too, yet despite this the impossibly deep-voiced actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger, drama, or anything worthy of a horror film - it's strictly pg rated. and in this instance the actors peg out in exactly the order that everyone expects them to - i quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character, only getting piper perabo out of sequence. the cave script is entirely by-numbers, unlike shakespeare a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in under a week... take a typical exchange between the 'good buddy' white and black leads that goes; "how many times have we been in this situation before bud?" - "too many" (replies morris chesnut). i swear, you could hear my suburban london audience gasp at the obviousness. the scariest thing about the cave is that at the end there's a clear opening for 'the sequel' - 'the cave 2: overground' or whatever. be afraid, be very afraid... or instead catch the descent and be truly afraid, very very very afraid. rr

the scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel. 'the cave' is really a disappointing action movie. a team of cave and undersea researchers go to romania (one of these inexpensive places to make a movie, for now at least) and following a destroyed church enter in a cave that proves to be a realm of underground monsters. or are they daemons? the movie never decides if it wants to be action, science fiction, or horror, it is a mix of all without salt or fun, and acted in a wooden manner. the best thing about the movie is the cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring, because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting. waste of time.

i went to see this movie to kill some time. i remember cole hauser in "tigerland", and although his acting is wooden, he does portray a tough "leader" character. same here. this movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in romania that one has to dive to see. the beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of romanian or russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. flash forward 30 years, and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose. there is a lot of clichéd, useless talk. the women are too hot for their jobs, let's face it. i hate to watch the lips of these women talk about the guys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. i mean it was like we were at some bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sex--not a group of scientists and divers. every character had zero personality, with perhaps exception of the scientist, who at least wasn't one of the young and beautiful people. so, the acting, although workmanlike, was not inspiring. the dialog was pretty bad. at one point in the movie, cole hauser ("jack"), the lead diver--his irises morph into the cingular wireless symbol, and stay like that. we are led to believe that, since he was scratched by one of these monsters, that he is turning into one of them. fair enough. but first of all, nobody says the obvious thing to him: "what is up with your eyes, dude??" no. everybody just talked about how he's "changed" and that he should not be the leader of the group anymore. and then this guy says, "you see how he's not human". huh? if they really believed he was a friggin' monster, then why not act like it? instead, the group splits in two--those who go with jack, and those who go their separate ways, i guess thinking him to be a monster. it makes no sense.the best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman crawls up a cave wall, and gets attacked by this goblin. her scream really sucked--but she fought like hell to dispatch the goblin.the photography was fine when the camera was still. but any action sequences, the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flashing bubbles, flashlights, dark space, god knows what. i wish they would just show us a scene straight once in awhile. just because you move the camera all over the place doesn't make the movie any scarier, folks. this movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been made:1. every actor was replaced by someone who looked real. let cole hauser be the lead, it's ok to let him be the good-looking one. i'm getting tired of seeing 20-something supermodel scientists. give me a break, people!2. the cinematographer was fired, and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat still. this could be the director's fault, i don't know. jumpy camera (as in constant gardener) is getting old, folks.3. we got to see the goblins actually devour the people. how bout some gore? there's not much else in this movie. we barely got to see the creatures--i felt a little ripped off about that. 4. the ending was pretty lame. during the denouement, the sexy british scientist has a secret...guess what that is? it's a bit canned. the ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy (morris chestnut), who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions. all the other actors had no expression.i gave it a 4 out of 10, because after all, the acting was without noticeable errors, and the concept was fairly original. i'd like to see cole do more military roles--he's good at it.

i though this film was okay.i din't think it was great.it was a bit too slow for my taste.lots of drama,but not very much action until close to the end of the film.this movie was basically a dramatic film,with the payoff,if you can call it that,not until near the end.to me,the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the town,were okay,but much too brief.the film itself is done okay,the acting is decent,but it just didn't do it for me,in the long run.think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie.at least that's what i think.the other factor is that i had just recently watched '10.5' and its sequel '10.5:apocalypse'.these are 2 big budget "event movies,which,in my opinion, are a very hard act to follow,in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction.as a result,i have to rate killer flood:the day the damn broke at 4/10

right... so you have a dam, tons of water (that seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that happens to be right underneath the dams path of destruction. throw in a profiteering glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son, and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting. all in all, when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view... i would feel extremely peeved off if this was a pay-per-view film. if you want a laugh... then you really need to watch this film.

why can't there be better tv movies made i was at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the uk. what a terrible waste of my time it was . poor sets, poor acting & oh my god what a terrible flood . blimey that woman can even outrun a torrent of water too!.i really wish that people would make tv movies using better effects, better or at least more believable plots & far better acting. killer flood is well up there with poor acting. a few bits of ham couldn't act any worse.1 final thing i really agree with the comment about the dog, but i believe it would of already scarpered in real life!

this movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good. it is truly appalling. its closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie, but alas they were serious. made for tv, but not worthy of even that. it contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. oh will he save the town from the flood? will his wife admit that she still loves him? will they escape before the flood drowns them? i cant explain how bad this is. awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy. bad effects (although to be fair i have seen worse super-imposed bubbling water). bad script. woeful acting. hideous. so bad in fact that you probably should get drunk and watch it.

when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget. either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up. what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot. when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my tv was broken.this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one.

the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high ... when he accepted to direct this movie... ... i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being ... punished to watch that stupid movie ... my parents make me watch it as punishment...... ... don't watch it !!! the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high ... when he accepted to direct this movie... ... i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being ... punished to watch that stupid movie ... my parents make me watch it as punishment...... ... don't watch it !!! the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high ... when he accepted to direct this movie... ... i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being ... punished to watch that stupid movie ... my parents make me watch it as punishment...... ... don't watch it !!!

even a awful 1 is to much for this film, everything form start to finish made you cringe. i don't think it would be possible to cram more overly clichéd moments, into one piece of mind numbingly numbingly waste of film.prisoner cell block h meets thunderbirds, hell even virgil's expressions were more life like than his son.i haven't even finished watching this and i'm on here now.... oh no, the cheesy clapping of 3 actors and a backdrop done by a child with adobe premiere. this truly is the end of my "i've started so i'll finish watching it" phase.oh joy, the credits have come to rescue me. (and relax)

this is one of those made-for-tv b movies that is so awful it kind of endears.bad acting, predictable script and cheesy special effects that were pretty much some of the cheapest tat seen make you have to keep watching to see if it gets any better.it doesn't!

what a dreadful movie. the effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. what was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. the acting was awful and i mean awful. the point in the story where michelle green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. they see the water approaching and run for their lives. (by the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make ms green look to unfit). they manage to outpace the water for some time before taking refuge. what speed! later, a speeding car is not fast enough to escape the torrent. god, she and that dog did run fast! if you want to watch a good movie about a dam breaking - this isn't it. porchlight entertainment turn out some good family films but this time they just missed the mark.

killer flood: the day the damn broke: 1/10: finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. even by the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of made for tv disaster movies this is truly awful. where do i begin? the dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but i doubt it. most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity have oh i don't know a power plant nearby, some sluice gates for water to run through, heck even a high tension electrical wire or two. the dam is also somewhat understaffed. two, count them, two employees staff the entire dam, all three shifts. and the employees were apparently imported from a clichéd ridden world war two film, as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of grandchildrenn floating by. heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description. the special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photo's of the town in a method that makes a sixties godzilla film look like the matrix. a three-year-old drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results. since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film? needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead. this is no diamond in the rough. this is the rough. so is it a guilty pleasure? killer flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic, but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine. (avalanche, the swarm, meteor) it is also doubtful that michelle green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great henry fonda being pelted by raisins that are supposed to be killer bees. check back with me in 2024.

possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. pathetic in almost every way.i threw the dvd straight in the bin - i didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop.the effects are beyond a joke. the dam control room looks like cardboard. the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds - nothing works.then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon.i couldn't wait for them all to drown.

this was by far one of the worst movies sandra bullock has starred in. ben affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. this is definitely his forte and acting is not. i actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before i was so bored with it i felt compelled to leave the theater. it's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. the premise of "guess what happened to me on the way to the ...." has been done over and over to death. somehow there just doesn't seem to be anything funny, or romantic about people cheating on each other. parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children especially impressionable ones that may view sandra as a hero. there is a scene where the writers/producers/directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint .... while driving .... and then have no consequences at all when caught. i'm no prude, and i smoked my share when i was younger but i guarantee you i won't take my teenagers to see it and they're solid a & b students. if you want to see a good sandra bullock movie, rent "the net" or "hope floats" which i believe are two of her best works.

it seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes, trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more, where it failed miserably. some may like the nontraditional ending, but the attempts at "deep insight" into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere.but if you were interested by the story, the movie tried other methods to distract you. the unnecessary special effects, of which the falling rain was the most obvious, served to do nothing but annoy. the camera-work is erratic at best.one note of caution, however. my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying, sitting in the first row with a group of young'uns around...

there were some decent moments in this film, and a couple of times where it was pretty funny. however, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie. there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film, and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by. there was better chemistry between him and liv tyler in armageddon. hell, there was better chemistry between sly and sandra in demolition man.there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.this was a poor remake of "my best friends wedding". wait until it's been out for a year and a half on video and rent it in the .49 cent bin if you've got nothing else to do on a rainy sunday afternoon, and you can't think of any better movies to rent.

this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad. i really lost it with those out of the blue not so "special effect". guys, if you're an insomniac go with your girl to see this movie. i give it three sleepies!

this movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. the director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. steve zahn was good, as always. ben affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy. sandra bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany, but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her child, going on carnival rides, offering to strip for money, and bumming a ride with a fellow airline passenger. the script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. it introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them off before they could develop. to top it all off, the "twist" at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy. if you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it, as i did, my advice is: don't go to the movie. it will only spoil a nice trailer.

ben affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (sandra bullock, forcing herself to act insane). who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? it is so badly edited, when i looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! rife with clichés, contrivances, and sandra bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters. laughs are non-existent: the scene in the gay bar with affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren't so stupid (the bar patrons--a big rowdy bunch of them!--shout for affleck to strip and start digging out their cash). it's not supposed to have any significance other than getting ben to loosen up a little, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong-headed, and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away...or was that all the film he had? it's a small moment but it's typical of this film, an amateurish piece of pop-goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts. it is tailor-made for the bottom shelf at your video store. * from ****

this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality, don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film. this is, without peer, the single worst movie that i have ever seen in my life. i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it. the acting was terrible, and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film. the film blatently rips off far superior sci-fi films, such as timecop or total recall (where the title seems to have been derived from). i'm sorry, but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours. if you already have seen this movie, i feel sorry for you for going through what i did.

i rented this movie for about $1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) i have ever spent. it's lame! i couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this.the plot... there is no plot. everything you'd expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. the acting was horrible. my dog could've done better. the special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief. and the cheesy lines.... i mean, why even bother? the only credit i can give this piece of sh*t are the opening scenes. they were actually quite pretty. and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this. the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film.total reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it lower.

this film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. but don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. only a little unexpectedly, though nothing worth watching the thing through for.from the taciturn and wronged hero, to the germanic baddy, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. the two fbi agents smith and wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour, but that came to nothing.i am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film. a turkey!

there is no reason to watch this film.why? many reasons. first up, the acting is awful. there is hardly a line that isn't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity, and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth. it is awfully written. one of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line."repeat?" "yes, they repeat it. for the whole movie." "the whole movie?" "yes, the whole movie." etc. in movies like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after. (all the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys. setting up a good "mwahahaha! with x in my grasp i will rule the universe!" villain is the first stop in any cheapo sf plot) but in this turkey? - you tell me.as i understand it our "heros" are a bunch of mass murderers sent into the past on a dirty dozen type mission. they are sent by a fascistic totalitarian state to stop some other mass murderers from altering the course of history. the new history would not include the rise of totalitarianism, and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet (we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long on-screen situation reports just before the action starts, telling you who is who and what is what. it's an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be, that it is narrated as well as appearing on screen - just to save the audience from taxing their brains too much by doing a lot of reading.) so just who are we supposed to be rooting for here? i guess we are asked to believe our hero undertakes some sort of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace, and understanding while shooting loads of people - but that doesn't work as an arc because we are shown he is a decent(ish) human being right at the start when he tries to rescue all the civilians aboard the rebel station.i guess the makers were aiming at some sort of deeper than normal complexity in this film but they just ended up with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average crap sf movies.the opening credits were nice.

don't buy this film for comedy value like i did, i didnt find it one bit funny, but so f****** miserable and lame it's unbelievable. i gave it to a friend for christmas which was pretty funny (on my side) i recently heard that he watched it and told me what an a**ehole i am!there is nothing more frustrating than watching an over-lit, over dramatic, poorly scored scene in which the camera is sat there on a tripod and doesn't move... the film work is truely pathetic, and i can only say dont watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!

as i mentioned in other comments, i became a real big fan of david bradley ever since i saw him in "american ninja 3". the guy is great doing martial arts, has some kind of charisma and is a cool looking dude on screen. sadfully, he went to the dtv department ever since his debut and has remained as one of the king of tv movies until 2001 where he apparently stopped making movies. now, one thing is watching cyborg cop or hard justice which are crappy clichéd movies but real fun to watch (coz they're entertainingly bad if that has any sort of meaning) but another thing is watching a tasteless piece of boredom like total reality. i mean, this and crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse-dung this guy ever did. i wouldn't recommend this not even to the biggest bradly hardcore fans. if i had known this and crisis were going to be so f*****g crap, i wouldn't have spent the 3 or 4 euros they cost me. total reality is just as boring as crisis although funnily, it starts promising. a group of military prisoners in the future are given a chance to stop some kind of disaster in the past (i'm sorry, i didn't really pay much attention to this atrociousness) and they only have 24 hours to get back or something like that. if they don't, they're stranded there forever. the poor director who oversaw this, "tries" some humorous (?) clichés like the convicts arriving on earth and not knowing what a truck is for example (wow, hilarious...). the movie follows up with david bradley teaming up with some earth girl for the rest of the flick. this bored me so much that i had to force myself to watch it in like 3 or 4 installments to at least make use of the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. that's coz every time i tried, i fell asleep. and if you get a movie with david bradley with just one crappy 10-second fight scene in it, then that's the final touch which would contribute to you throwing it off a hundred foot cliff so as never to see it again. i wish i could meet the "director" of this pile of poo on the street and i swear to god i'd ask him back for mi 5 euros. i'd also love to meet david bradley to ask him why in god's name did he choose to star in this poor excuse for a movie. don't even bother with this film, i mean it from the bottom of my heart, not renting borrowing it and specially not buying it.

rigoletto is verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. the maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled gilda as a horny ditz. opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at zeferelli's magnificent la traviata --- but when a work is as superb as rigoletto, it doesn't need cheap gimmicks. it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that.

publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the duke of mantua urinating during his reprise of la donna è mobile, nor is it sensational to see gilda sing caro nome in the bath. it is just crass and boring. what stands out about this film is its lack of imagination. director corina van eijk sets the duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool. in fact, he is not the duke, he is just a character named duka, so it's difficult to see why he has lots of hangers-on and his own jester, rigoletto. rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors.the duke's, sorry duka's heavies ride around on motor scooters (yawn). concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected, and unintentional humour. what can we make of the fact that gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council flat.? when the call goes out that monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts. one imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool.it was common for opera films to be lip-synced 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today. a dubbed opera is like soft porn. you don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort. the actress in gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. she barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing. when she sings caro nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted. it is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from. the duke, later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon.the ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio. fairly slow, rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub.this is a film of a production by opera spanga. spanga is a village in friesland in the netherlands. they normally perform in a tent in a field. if i had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in friesland i would have been fairly indulgent. by filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule.

hi! i'm sheena, an african (yet white!) jungle tribal princess who possesses the incredible ability to transform into the cheapest, unscariest monster in the world (think 60s star trek aliens) by rolling seductively in mud! when i first found myself in this horrible position, i took the only logical action: i made myself a torn-apart jungle bikini in which to perform my badly-acted antics. i enjoy romance novels and tearing apart the occasional unimpressive african warlord. and i would be remiss if i did not mention my (white, of course) sidekick mr. cutter, an american ex-military man who seems to have fled the u.s. after his divorce. can you say "ducking alimony"? anyway, he provides the occasional distraction from my difficult life. i mean, how many idiot blonds do you know who are also an endangered species of flesh-rending monster? despite my many hardships (acting is so hard! *whine*), i haven't given up, and after much soul-searching, i have finally discovered my role in life: to terrorize insomniatic late-night television viewers who are so unfortunate as to not have cable or satellite.

a very bad film, an amalgam of clichés and historical inaccuracies. a few examples: in an early scene soviet infantry are attacked by the germans; instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they advance into open ground to fight them,contrary to all infantry tactics; kate, one of the central characters, is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and obsessed with her russianness, yet she does not speak russian; a guilt-stricken german airman attacks an anti-aircraft gun- the gun, however, does not fire shrapnel shells but scores a direct hit on his 'plane, which doesn't look much like a german 'plane of wwii. in fairness, when they could escape the preposterous plot and the consequent absurdities there are some genuinely powerful moments- the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving, but these only show up the rest of it even more. a film to be avoided.

you can generally ask two questions concerning 80's low-budget horror films. and this `demon wind' in particular. 1. is it a good film? no.. 2. is it a fun film?? you bet! demon wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale, filled with cheesy make-up effects and nasty violence. the story is pretty much non-existent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups' ancestors. apparently, his grandparents used to live in a devil-worshiping neighborhood, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still dwells around there. but, i got to hand it to this film.from start to finish, it breathes morbidity! the diabolical undertones, the playful gore and the (relatively) decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream, uninspired 80's slashers for sure. it shows some creativity and guts (literally) where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily. this creators clearly got inspired by the success of `the evil dead', and perhaps even lamberto bava's `demons, but what the heck! it's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm. although.this film does have a pretty high `what the f***'- standard at times. especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed. and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians? nonetheless, `demon wind' gets my recommendation if your likes aren't too high concerning crap horror!

demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. it is definitely an awful example of a film. so awful in fact that i don't even consider it a movie. i describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. a thing that must be stopped at all costs. my friends and i first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. it's just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of evil dead. the whole "story" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. i've seen bad horror movies before (manos, troll 2, hobgoblins!!!) (shudder) i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.fun fact: this film is like a cockroach on steroids! much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. kind of scary huh?

i swear i didn't mean to! i picked this out only since it looked good on the back! this movie wasn't scary at all and actually was very confusing. the demon wind was only actually used a couple of times and people were killed off pretty cheesily. the one major bright spot was seeing sherri bendorf from slaughterhouse play in it. seeing what happened to her, however, made up my mind for this little turkey of a film. a 3 out of 10. next!

jim varney's first real movie is quite a delight, but don't come in expecting to see ernest p. worrel any time soon. i felt the wide array of characters varney depicted were great, but without being said, the rest of the movie should be put into a mulcher or something. a rather odd beginning for a movie icon.

irwin allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish "epic" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the earth. potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. varied players from walter pigeon and joan fontaine to frankie avalon and barbara eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. good for a few stray laughs, but allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense. later a popular tv series. ** from ****

i was surprised after watching this piece of crap , if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry pours some liquid onto him and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with added erotic topping a man becoming invisible and doing s*i* is the conclusion of the movie. involving too much sex in a cartoon themed movie doesn't increase its worth :( , and most of all i was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show up the mr.invisible and that was really awful i must say , flour drops off the rack and our very own mr.invisible becomes visible "watch zack and miri make a porno" i bet you wont get bored, 1/10 from me

after just viewing the movie, i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. this takes my worst movie award away from komodo, which is no easy feat. it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. the acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. why was a joke such as this put in the film? was the director thinking; "i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a laffy taffy wrapper." another retarded part is when norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling. why did they even bother to give the film a nc-17 rating, were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible? at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality. i pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond.

i rented this type of "soft core" before, but i can honestly say, i wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as "rod steele: you only live until you die"--which was both sexy and funny. it had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. it also has gabriella hall who is hot. the reason why i didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the "must be 18 to rent" sticker. i was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake."first of all, i think movies shouldn't be allowed to start with "actors" rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or wherever "actors" rehearse). in this movies seeing the "actors" rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie.okay, having found out that this was a soft core movie, i didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. but, the dizzying way the extended video "erotic" scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of, say, rod steele. you know they must've had some money, because i think some of it is filmed overseas.i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs i've ever seen. and, i've seen torgo from manos! it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and gabriella hall). still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.

what can have been on irene dunne's mind when she accepted the role in this distasteful account of a woman of negotiable morals? certainly, the irene dunne of the 1940's, whose reputation as a faithful roman catholic who publicly abhorred smut, and shunned any film scripts or hollywood society, that might be even be remotely construed as corrupting public morals--would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this.perhaps, new york's cardinal spellman, in his private audience with her, gave her a good dressing down over this role? that we will likely never know, inasmuch as she never spoke of it in later years, though she did denounce her morally suspect, (though quite successful) 1932 film, "back street" as "trash".certainly by the time she received the distinguished st. robert bellarmine award in 1965 for exemplary public catholicism, "ann vickers" was no longer recalled by the general public.suffice it to say that "ann vickers" works neither as entertainment or social commentary.miss dunne's role as an adulterous social worker, who sleeps around, (between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on correctional rehabilitation) doesn't dovetail with her temperament or on screen demeanor, and one keeps suspecting that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag, (what else can we think when we witness a montage of miss dunne's sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed over a shot of a female prisoner being scourged?) by films end, she has renounced careerism in favor of marriage, (to crusty convict walter huston no less--and what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically?) irene dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity, if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge: "i'm going to get you off the snow cold turkey" !!! well, if nothing else such sordid goings on, do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic trills, furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphates--cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable miss dunne.

when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie. i was wrong. all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others. some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.i feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as varsity blues, friday night lights, stick it, etc. and if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one. even the adult humor in this movie was dry. do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don't rent this movie

the spoof genre, which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already, gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent. no point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers. it takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. any clod can pick up a cam-corder, and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies, there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways, to get you to laugh hysterically. it doesn't work.that's not comedy. however, the same old worn out sophomoric "jokes" ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. if that's not enough, there's a running "gag" of a bus running somebody over. so funny, right? also, one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than michael bay; again with the same unfunny results. a musical bit flops miserably. pity carl weathers, once apollo creed in the rocky series, now stuck with roles in swill like this.lousy beyond words. watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. probably a lot funnier, too.

oh dear, oh dear! what were they thinking of? terrible script, terrible acting. i don't even feel sorry for the actors... they took their cheques to the bank and smiled happily.since when did an air shaft from charing cross pop out at bank? why are vehicles crossing tower bridge going in towards the city when the surge hit? why is tower bridge not crowded when the city is being evacuated? how does carlyle dive into a raging torrent.... and survive? i could go on... and on.there is no real sense of urgency in the command room. they might just as well be waiting for the england eleven to come back onto the pitch after the tea interval at lords.it says something when i await the adsbreaks to learn more about diarrahoea treatment with eager anticipation.totally abominable trash!

it was inferred by a previous poster that the military would not be subordinate to the police in a disaster as depicted in the film. in fact the military role would be to supply aid to the civil authorities when requested to do so. the civil authorities would retain primacy. in practise the army would need 48 hours or so to mobilise themselves, there not being much army presence in london, especially with current overseas commitments. even then they would be dependent on calling in the ta.as for cobra, we were given the impression that it was a full governmental emergency department in its own right - even reference to a met police cobra division. in fact cobra stands for cabinet office briefing room "a". it's just the room where the pm or dpm meet their advisers to discuss the current emergency!

this film was just on two nights running on itv1.. dear oh dear. someone actually bought this on the strength of robert carlylse.. ok, i missed the start.. but what i did see was so bad i thought, no... i watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it. nothing was based on reality, i doubt things would progress as they did in this film. everything was poor about this film. ok, cgi.. but no reality. the write up gave the impression of a cliff hanger end..sorry, i wasn't impressed. yes, formulaic. couldn't guess the end. from what i saw the military had the upper hand, people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing, it just wouldn't have happened that way? it was worse than leave your brain at the door. it was annoying.. as someone else said.. yeah, right.. of course that would have happened... not!! the credits mentioned quebec and canada.. so it was a co production, missed the third party concerned.. i'll have to check back on this site. i'm not usually this critical, but this annoyed me.

in addition to all the negative reviews: i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere, somehow a cctv-camera was summoned at a most unlikely location, to show the 'crisis'-team (''look maaaaa-aaam'') what was going on, notably near the thames-barrier, where the professor is hit at full (wind)force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story. otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films/programs: i said to my wife: 'hey, that's neil, from the young ones' (nigel planer) and 'did they summon hercule poirot for help?' (david suchet). to add to the disgrace of this film (shown in two parts on itv uk recently), itv showed the telephone number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers, living in areas 'at risk of flooding'. how low can you as a broadcaster go to treat your audience like that? what must the environment agency have thought?? (''oh no, it's mrs jones from hull again. she says she was right all along, she saw it on itv'').

i'll put it straight to you, this movie is dead boring. it's about a flood, that's it. blah blah a little about family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah blah boring. blame it all on the weatherman, poor sod. the deputy prime minister campbell is a hard-ass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a most irritating character. if you are from the united kingdom, or anywhere that it may flood, then you might like this film. it's sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen. this is not really an action film, where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer, or outrun it literally, it is more like a time-bomb that must be disabled. looking at this movie, it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is overpopulated, it isn't, but for them it is. really, the movie is about as exciting as picking scabs and i can't recommend it. it's over 100 minutes, far far too long.the problems with the film; i won't get into them beyond this because the film doesn't deserve such dissection. hint to you londoner's - buy more boats. if you bring children to this movie they'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons.

this movie was so bad it was funny! for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la "for your consideration"). the "cliffhanger" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. the script was dreadful enough, but coupled with sean young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie. i still can't believe how this thing got made. first of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? how did star actors get attached? were they at low points in their careers? questions, questions.

there's simply no redeeming quality about this film. ok, some of the costumes are ok, but they're nothing you can't see in, say, the conan flicks. and what's up with ator's hair? i can't believe this is part of a series! i will say one thing about this film: it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else.

this movie's one redeemable quality (besides ator's barely-there loincloth) is the hilarious acting on the part of the bad guy, zor. this wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain...oh, shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). i just giggled every time he pirouetted, lifting an incredulous eyebrow to henchman or hero. a true example of someone not getting paid enough. (and that beard!)now really, what was with the 12-minute hang-glider scene? really, really, really bad. i can't emphasize that point enough.so, seriously, if you even deign to see this movie, watch the mystery science theater 3000 version. with those dear silhouettes has many a horrendous movie been tolerated.

i just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show "mystery science theater 3000!!!!!" and yes, i do find that advice really helpful! i mean, a movie that tries to be this good and this exciting just really is not what that movie wants to be!!!!! so yes, do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars, you can give this a ten out of ten stars! until then, my one star review is for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie only!!!!!! got that now?

honestly, the only reason i picked up this movie from blockbuster was because aaron carter was in it. okay first thing's first. do you notice how ugly aaron carter has become?? i mean, he used to be so cute but now..with that lanky body and blotchy skin - ew. i think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie could've found a much better-looking guy who could lip-sync. no offense though. i thought this teen movie was majorly lame - and this is coming from me, being a teen myself. the 'mean girls' in there are oh-so predictable, the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times (especially from aaron) and overall i just didn't enjoy it. although, i give out points for the storyline - that was alright, but not at all realistic. anyway, stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. it's not worth the $6.50!!(p.s; this review of mine may not be applicable to younger kids under the age of 13!)

i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes. unfortunately, i don't remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal braces jane wore. and i didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp. the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense. this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee length skirts, then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you.

what really stood out to me about this movie was how little the plot made sense. so many characters were randomly introduced, it was like how i imagine tommy wiseau's "the room" would be re-envisioned for the disney channel set. we had the wise elderly couple who kept on hanging out where "jane" worked, telling the same story about how "soda" brought them together, or jane's mom/stepmom/random crying woman who would all show up at random times.aaron carter's acting is definitely the highlight of this film: i actually looked forward to every scene he appeared in. the editing is painfully bad, with scene cuts that make no sense. the "jane" character is really irritating, mooning about and moping about "j.d. mcqueen." the scenes with the "music awards" are more depressing than anything else. and the ending of this movie is surreal.

never before has such a large cast of ugly people gathered together to make an equally ugly film.something huge and horrifying is loose in the waters off the florida coast, something that leaves half chewed up bodies behind in its wake. unshaven beer dependent bob thinks he has caught the thing's "evil voice" on tape. bob's assistant, the amazingly unattractive and painfully skinny stella, decides to enlist the help of slimy ladies man peter, an electrician whose equipment may be able to help them locate the mysterious creature. but anyone who sticks their nose too far into the mystery winds up dead, killed by a baboon faced hit-man with a bad perm. what is the terrible secret behind the sea killer? ugly scientists have torrid affairs, inept cops and doctors puzzle over the increasing numbers of corpses, stella and peter make out on the beach and characters we don't care about are killed off or munched up. the sea killer, a weird combination of an octopus, a shark and a pair of large dentures, never really seems as threatening as it should. the conspiracy behind the monster's creation makes no sense whatsoever. none of the characters are particularly likable, and the ones who might be are killed off immediately. this is a poorly shot, badly dubbed, plot less mess. the whole thing is so scuzzy and smelly it made me long for a hot bath. i've had sushi plates scarier than this film. avoid it, unless it's the mst3k version.

warning: may contain spoilers the ripples in the wake of the first "jaws" movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond. movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie: the ocean, deep space, genetics). although "jaws" was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror, few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original. "shark rosso nell'oceano" (aka devil fish or red ocean), is a dutiful follower of the original "jaws" formula. after several hapless boats and seagoers are brutally murdered by some ocean creature, there is an initial drive to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results, and a final push to destroy it. although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. this movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing, brittle acting, and cheap scares. the most sickly compelling feature of "devil fish" is its cookie-cutter editing. from the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together, the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility. it appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music. furthermore, every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms "fade", "wipe", or "dissolve". the impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins. silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time-lapse image of their act is composited over their bodies. the music is equally bland. the creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the "jaws" theme with slight variation. although i like to keep my reviews devoid of mst3k influence, mike most aptly described the somber score as "soft core porn music". failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to "devil fish". the acting is stale, the relationships baffling, and the whole conspiracy is laughable. the question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why couldn't a more practical use be administered to better mankind? one of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster, even though its film presence is less than stellar. overall, this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre. if "jaws" had never been made, then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively. sadly, as a carbon copy of spielberg's original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese.

boring, horrible piece of italian euro-trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time guzzling beer(this is what makes him american, right? our scientists spend most of their academic life soused out of their minds, sure. that's where all the really great theories come from), who's studying something(dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). he hears a weird sound through his headphones, proving that his radio is picking up a station in jamaica. at the same time, a jack skellington girl with one of the worst, most bleached manes of bad 80's hair that it has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm down the dolphins in the seaquarium she works at, as they're apparently upset about the amount of fish she's been doling out lately. the beginning of the film was a really badly colored storyline about two annoying, very italian people who's boat is attacked by something unseen under the water. the whiny woman is never seen again(best part of the story), and the guys' corpse is found with no legs. the dim, alcoholic scientist(who has an inexplicable, english- american- italian accent) and the stick girl with the hay hair begin to theorize that there's some kind of giant monster lurking under the seas off the coast of italy...err..florida.they enlist the help of an electrician to set up an underwater mike, so that the monster can sing karaoke. this guy has a beautiful girlfriend, who's only drawback is that she pronounces peter "pey-tah", but for some reason he's sexually drawn to the anatomical skeleton with the frizzly hair, a situation that leaves one blinking.the dubbing is awful, the editor a spaz, and the storyline generally a yawn. there's a bit about how this weird scientific corporation genetically engineered this monster giant shark-squid-barracuda thing for some reason that makes no sense, and a really unpleasant greasy haired guy goes around killing women, again for no apparent reason. a stupid sheriff and his bulked up deputy are along for the ride, along with a female scientist(who we know is smart because she wears huge glasses). at one time the woman scientist takes on the huge, terrible monster(yeah, right, ed wood's giant octopus was more believable) with only a small handaxe, and she wins the contest. hooray for skinny little women, who obviously make the best monster hunters!the solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the everglades, leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction. to hell with ecology and the environment, right? we have to kill this giant monster! at the end, the electrician and his broomstick love ride off into the sunset on her vespa, which is o.k. since she's gotten over her colleagues' death and he's not very upset that his girlfriend got whacked by the crazy guy with the greasy hair. hooray for true love! wait a minute, isn't there something fishy about all this...

sometimes it's hard to judge how bad a film made in italy or spain really is, because they all seem to use the same stable of 9-10 esl trained voice actors to supply the english voices for release in the us. and things are always lost in translation anyway -dialog, character shtick and plot elements written for the expectations of european audiences may not go too well with our american ideas of what is funny, hip, or dramatic. i imagine that the team responsible for making the translation for the sound track of this movie to english had about 3 days to do it from start to finish, and they probably each earned the equivalent of an installment payment on their used fiat to do it. in other words, pure hackwork, tossed off in one or two takes and never reviewed or redone by someone with a real ear for the american language.watching "devil fish", i can imagine that if you were an italian watching this presented in your native language, you might find it a mildly amusing little piece of fluff. you'd laugh at the 'in jokes' and the amusing drunk, you'd gasp at the monster and the villainy of the bad guys, and you'd ogle at the attractive pair of peter and not-quite-daryll hannah as they couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of a search for clues about a man-eating monster who has already killed one of their friends.but since the jarring voice acting and tin-eared dialog keep yanking we americans out of the film experience, we can't help but notice that the editors had serious attention deficit disorder, that no one on screen can really act so much as project an attitude, that the stated reason for the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense, that the action sequences have all the impact of a cereal bowl full of cooked oatmeal and that the director, screenwriters and producers really hate women.don't even think about buying or renting this movie - watch only on cable tv on saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your fist, or with the help and protection of mike and the bots on mst3k.

i'm not sure what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this poor excuse for a film, but whatever they thought of didn't help this movie, it only hurt it, and it hurt this film badly. the acting, for once, isn't the problem, it's the horrible editing, scenes will end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in mid sentence. i'm not sure what the story was, but it didn't really matter, since what i did see was fairly uninteresting. just bad all around, a huge "jaws" rip-off and not a good one at that. the mst version was funny though. 7 for that, none for the film itself.

italians movie-makers love to rip off american movies. all of our movies, and as often as possible. i'm not stating that as a slur against italy as a whole, but i would like to further observe that the italian film industry does itself great harm by allowing travesties like this to go overseas to be seen by the world at large. that's all i'm saying.and no more grave injury do the italian people subject themselves to than by not sticking a harsh penalty upon those who made the world watch "shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is, admittedly, a ripoff of the far-superior "jaws" (as if you didn't know).let's dive into the plot (get it? haw-haw...): this huge monstrous swimming thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and steven tyler attacks many innocent americans (ie: italians) off the coast of florida (ie: italy) and the intrepid, beer-swilling peter (sopkiw) sails out with his anorexic, beer-swilling girlfriend and other beer-swilling people whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature, killed by mysterious forces who want the creature left alone or just stand around and be otherwise useless (and swill beer)...or be the doctor in this film who defibrilates dying patients repeatedly (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for his paddles to recharge (must be one heck of a good battery there, doc).then there's the monster...brother, if you thought the "jaws" shark was fake, look herein and have your mind changed immediately.this is a movie that was directed as an afterthought (by a bava!), edited with an onion chopper, acted by ambulatory (beer-swilling) pieces of driftwood and written by (presumably beer-swilling) people who should never ever ever ever be let near a typewriter, movie studio or major city in the world ever again. if this is how the people who made this film think real people act in such a situation, they've obviously made one too many of them zombie movies. or swilled too much beer.need i say this movie is bad? it is: bad like green cottage cheese; bad like a hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad like the "bad theatre" skits dan aykroyd used to host on "saturday night live"; bad like calista flockhart weight gain tablets - get it? good.mike and the sol gang slap this beer-drunk beauty upside the head repeatedly and reveal this "horror" film as what it is: horrible. though, with a certain european charm: it's charming, when watched by a european - preferably a beer-swilling one.no stars for the waterlogged, dead fish known as "shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the mst3k version. ...and now, anyone for a beer?

i cannot get over how awful this movie was. my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack. there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus. no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them. the acting is just so awful it sounds like an instruction video for social studies class. i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie. nothing. even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit. he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door. maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie. then there is some horse manure in the whole mix. it was torture watching this movie. then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together isn't a crime and they all hug him and love him. stealing gas is a crime. stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something. avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.

if i were to rate this movie based solely on the acting/script/production, etc., i would give it one star. all these elements are awful. i can partially forgive this, in light of the film's $250 budget. the movie does contain many entertaining scenes, mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety. some of these include: a 14-year-old kid stealing and driving a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom is sporting a joy division t-shirt) getting scared away from harassing the film's protagonists by a woman brandishing an obviously fake firearm, and an encounter with a plastic bull's skull in the arizona desert.i would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that horribly annoying, morally pontificating old granny. i had to dock one star just because of her. who the *bleep* makes a wedding cake with black frosting, anyhow?

ahem.. i think i'll be the only one who's saying this but yes, i was a lil bored during the film. not to say that this is a bad movie, in fact it's a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions - dilemma, sorrow, love.., esp it's the director's debut (read from somewhere, is it true?). i felt that something's not quite right, maybe it's just me, i'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world. this is a simple story, about ordinary people, ordinary lives. through simple and short dialogs, the director tries to relate a simple guy's life, and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time. oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me, such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man! i must say, i didn't feel the impact that most readers felt, in fact i was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they're comfortable with each other, the granny who came back for another shot - this is kinda melancholic, the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad - hmm but this is predictable.. don't misunderstood that i'm an action-lover, independent films are my cup of tea! perhaps i just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery. some asian films worth the watch: tony takitani (depicts loneliness) wayward cloud (only 1 dialog) my sassy girl (i like it!) 4.30 (loneliness as well) 15 (gangsters lives in local setting) before sunrise and before sunset (i just have to mention these even though they are not asian films. fans will understand!)

black eye (2 outta 5 stars) unimaginatively-filmed '70s action movie looks like it was made for tv... only the occasional cuss word and a subplot about lesbianism tip you off that the movie was actually made to be shown in theatres. fred williamson plays a tough guy ex-cop who becomes a tough guy private eye. he stumbles upon a couple of murders and attempted murders linked to a mysterious cane. there are some fistfights, a bullit-inspired car chase, a fairly original elevator scene and even time for williamson to confront the rich, lesbian lover of his girlfriend (teresa graves). there is also a scene with williamson bullying a poor old man by tearing up some priceless old autographed photos in his memorabilia shop. yeah, way to go, tough guy... maybe you can find a cripple to beat up later? obviously meant to cash in on the success of "shaft" (this and about six thousand other movies), this movie doesn't have enough edge or enough originality to make much of an impression.

his significant charisma and commanding presence are about all that keep this afloat, but fred williamson has done far better urban action films including many of his later, vid-released fare. the big studios' williamson films of the early-to-mid 70's rarely had the punch of their mid-level counterparts, and this is a prime example. clumsy action, little violence, and the pg rating is nowhere near questionable. worth a look for hammer completists in any case.

after slightly over 50 years of avid film watching, i've come up with some simple rules for making good movies.1.	introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour 2.	keep your characters to a minimum. if adapting a novel, combine characteristics and actions of minor characters into one person 3.	make sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation 4.	keep the action clear. violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either 5.	get the best music money can buy. frequently it matters more than acting, photography, etc. 6.	usually if a movie isn't very good within the first 10 minutes, it's not going to get any better`cannon for cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. elmer bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst i've ever heard in a modestly budgeted movie. this is altogether surprising considering bernstein's credentials (`man with the golden arm,' `the magnificent seven,' `the great escape,' `sons of katie elder'). paul wendkos' direction is lackluster and confusing. performances vary from very good (don gordon, peter duel) to terrible (raf vallone, giovanna ralli, gabriele tinti) with the usually reliable george peppard falling somewhere in the middle. this should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script, which breaks rules 1, 2 and 3.don't waste your time. i give `cannon for cordoba' a `3'.

i do not know which one was first released earlier in 1970 . cannon for cordoba is an "europen western" it was made in spain. this means this is fairly inferior to sergio leone's so-called #western spaghetti and to the real american masterpieces of john ford, sam peckinpah, howard hugues,john sturges and anthony mann, in my order of merit. this order is not to be interpreted as all john ford westerns are better than all by sam peckipahn's. i think imdb's 100 sort them out all pretty well.the worse about this firm is the casting. george peppard is fit for a sergeant's role, raff valone for a "maffia capo" and giovanna ralli to a "puttana" in "piazza vennezia" in the sixty's in rome.

you know you've got a bad film when you hear that the soundtrack is performed completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer, without any melody or sense of rhythm.it's hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously, even while giving it a bad review. this film is way beneath 'bad'.the continuity of this film is outrageously butchered. in one fight scene, we the hero (wearing bluejeans and undershirt) turn a corner with two revolvers in his hand; he doubles back, only now he has two semi-automatics in his hands; he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands; he chases down a hallway and comes out (suddenly dressed in standard army fatigue jacket)with a shotgun; after which he exits the building with yet another automatic rifle. or here's one for the books - a bus slams into a car at high speed; the car goes flying, thrown by a gigantic explosion - cut to the bus which is completely unscathed from the same explosion? the narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero - obviously - but every time they knock him out or otherwise get him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide they want him "to live to see this!" huh? one of the funnier moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him; then the bad guy decides he's not going to let the two meet after all; and this despite the fact that the the villain, the hero and his lawyer all know what's going on anyway, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and next we see the note being passed to the lawyer by another prisoner, even though we never see the hero give it to him. (this lawyer, btw, has complete access to the offices of the atf in california, including its confidential computer files.) huh? well, but it's a mindless action movie - so how're the action scenes? not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately they happen to be stoled from about a dozen hong kong films made five or ten years previously. the opening scene, a shoot-out in a junker garage, actually has shots the composition of which are stolen directly from "hard boiled" - so clearly so that it's a wonder john woo didn't sue for plagiarism.other hong kong films stolen from include "prison on fire", "island on fire", "burning paradise", "police story" i, ii, and iii (aka "supercop"). i thought i recognized a couple sammo hung clips here as well. in other words, the actions scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful duplications of action scenes from other films.there's nothing one can do with this film unless one shoots smack and just needs a lot of visual stimuli that needn't be make any sense.very funny film, for all the wrong reasons.

hell to pay was a disappointment. it did not have anywhere near the substance of a b western movie, and should in no way be compared to a fantastic movie like silverado. the dialog was dull, the plot was torpid, the soundtrack was overbearingly unnecessary, and the acting was awful. even the professionals could've taken some lessons from the sunset carson school of acting. the only positive thing about this movie is that it showcased some of the top cowboy shooters in the nation, but you can see them in a better light in any sass video. the packaging of this feature makes it very enticing, and the preview is decent, but it's all over after that.

this has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era. not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast. lee majors and bo svenson were fine but the rest of them look like their first time acting.so the budget was not tremendous. much of the costumes and set were believable but there were many things that jump out at the viewer to let us know that they couldn't double check or get all of the props to match the period.i can't think of one aspect of the film that i liked or didn't shake my head. your time will be better spent burning lint collected from your bellybutton.

not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a "b" western. story line was so-so but the filming, editing and acting were just plain bad. plus the music in the background was irritating to no end, too loud and just non-stop. many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music. i'm in sass (single action shooting society) and do some old west shooting with them, and a lot of the actors are members of this group, so that's why i bought it. if you have no interest in this group of people, or that sport, you certainly most likely wouldn't even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film. the acting of even the veteran actors (particularly stella stevens) left a lot to be desired also.

i simply cannot believe the folks that made and performed in this movie really took it seriously. the skits on snl look more real. everything was laughably fake. the goofy gunfights, the ridiculous fist fights, the dialogue, the sappy background music, and even bo's blind eye. had it been billed as a comedy, it still would have made more sense but still would be bad. i can see this as "entertainment" only if you get a room full of stoned college kids watching it like it were rocky horror picture show. imagine some of the stuff you saw on blazing saddles, like mongo knocking the horse down or the old lady gettinf stomach-punched. now imagine the producer wants you to take those scenes seriously and you get the gists of this disaster.

the seasoned actors in this do know how to act and have proved that before but the director, who also wrote and produced this travesty, is incompetent on so many levels. o.k. it's low budget but i know films students with lower budgets and lesser known actors who can do much, much better. for example, since there were people involved who should know better some of the gun rigs were totally out of place and never existed in those days. the stunt work was clumsy - the story stale and hokey. if some one gives you a copy of this use it for a coaster. by the way, i love westerns and have known many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors so i was looking for it to be good.

i am not sure who is having more fun, the people that wrote the reviews or the director of the movie. i could not go any longer reading this comments or watching this movie, i had to say something.i can see a low budget western film that is done with passion and interest on the detail, but using a garage with art deco lettering, pastel colors, actors that seem to be falling sleep because the script is so boring and the boom getting on the way of the camera every two scenes, that is definitely not my definition of "one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium".please if any of you guys had friends in the movie just say it!

there's no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted, overly melodramatic plot involving civil war bitterness, a crooked town boss, and other complications. it's all bad.stella stevens, andrew prine, bo svenson, william smith, tim thomerson and lee majors are all good actors that may not be big stars (or big stars anymore) but always made fun movies.here, they're all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap, with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department. in fact, most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too, which might not be so bad if it weren't so pretentious.the name of ed wood is invoked way too lightly these days. i think in this case the comparison is warranted. however, i suspect that old ed would have made a more entertaining western than this.

i love a good western movie, but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show. i could only stand 38 minutes of it in hopes that it would improve, but it only got worse and i had to end it. each actor(s) stated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards. there was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural occurrence or conversation. the wig on rachel kimsey was obvious. the actresses playing native american sisters, could have played non-native parts and should have. wardrobe for the native americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking. if i decide to watch it with any friends in the future, i will do so, not with the expectations of watching a good western, but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production.

i'm not sure what the point of making this film was. it looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local 'pistol pete' museum. at first it appears that it could be the beginning of a mad tv or snl sketch. but then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously. the story wasn't bad but the inclusion of the sass members seemed to be a ploy (that worked) to get me to see the film. i swear, the trailer listed every character in the film down to "dead cowboy #5". the reason westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. i just had the feeling i was watching civil war rean-actors dressed up as cowboys. not even worth the digital video it was recorded on.

i cannot see how anyone can say that this was a real good entertaining movie. with a few well known actors i found it hard to believe that this was only made in 2005. it's crap! the acting is tantamount to amateur dramatics, poor amateur dramatics. unless you want to laugh loudly at an amazing 100 minutes of pure corn, don't bother to download it or rent it, worst that i have seen in years. it's from the bygone days of acting, where cowboys are shooting 8 bullets from the six-shooters. the more well known the actor, the worse they were, drury was just sad. i was extremely disappointed with lee majors, has he actually stooped to this sort of garbage? it was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man.

yes, my summary just about tells it all.if you haven't watched this, try it. but not for pleasure. for studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family-oriented and "cool" at the same time.the men always think they know everything, are stupid, and finally loose to the magnificent women. etc.. this is especially offensive, when all the characters are just as terrible and stereotypic. i mean, ok, "cody" was funny one time or another, but unlike other "stupid characters(tm)" like woody in cheers or joey in friends, he doesn't get good lines. his stupidity is cast in a "duude" way, which gets quite annoying after a while.the family morale is awful. everything for the family. mother and father are supreme dictators, who inbetween severe punishing and old-fashioned parenting, constantly say they "love" their kids, and then of course, in the end, the kids love them back *barf*.and: there's always a "tender spot" like that squeezed into the "action", where american(c)(tm) morale lessons are forced upon the viewers, about sex (in a mature, you can't have sex before you're 18 (!!), kind of way), or drugs. even church-habits are thoroughly described here. the whole concept is directly sickening, all made in a half-hearted way to make money. if there are people like karen and frank out there, please lock them up and desintegrate the key.so, with themes ranging as far as revolting religious propaganda, i think it's fair to conclude as i did in my subject...

back in the cold and creepy early 90's,a show called "family matters" aired and became an instant classic.the trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts to sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a lovely little stealing-is-wrong,parents-are-right-show. so that worked out fine, so bickley-warren had a new ambitious plan: making the exact same show again.here's the difference though: "family matters" had urkel. "step by step" has the guy from those "kickboxer"-sequels nobody saw. he says things like "dudette" and "the dane-meister", and somehow the audience is still not supposed to hate him. i mean seriously, "dudette"? how can you even get that across your lips?the rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole winslow-bunch, combined with some more one-or-zero-dimensional characters, like the dumb guy (jt. well, eddie), the smart girl (laura), and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty(in theory).the character development was just awful in this show. grover and the cookie monster have more depth than the lambert family. everybody just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. they weren't worth much.powered by a massive laugh-and-cheer tape stolen from something funny,this show aired for a whopping 7 years,which was humiliating for the competition.although,you'll have to note that this is the time where family sitcoms were pretty much all big hits,everybody just ignored their crappyness because well,it was the 90s,one more crappy show didn't hurt.

in the early 1990's "step-by-step" came as a tedious combination of the ultra-cheesy "full house" and the long-defunct loopy classic hit "the brady bunch". the differences between "step-by-step" and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing, excellent comedic timing from almost all of it's actors, and a great deal funnier situations that weren't quite as sugar-coated as it's extremely popular predecessors. admittedly though, even with the big boosts in the show's basic dynamics and all it still wasn't exactly spectacular, nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming! it was just a much better time-passer, you might say, in comparison to the cutesy migraine-inducing "full house", which coincidentally, ran neck-and-neck with "step-by-step" during that time period in terms of overall popularity. the show, now in syndication obviously, is certainly suitable family-fare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it.

i was given this film by my uncle who had got it free with a dvd magazine. its easy to see why he was so keen to get rid of it. now i understand that this is a b movie and that it doesn't have the same size budget as bigger films but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than making this garbage. there are some fairly good performances, namely jack, beth and hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (assasin droid for example). this film also contains the worst fight scene i have ever seen. the amount of nudity in the film did make it seem more like a porn film than a sci-fi movie at times.in conclusion - awful film

cyber zone, as this dvd was sold in oz, is about the worst b-grade junk i have seen. apart from a restrained deadpan act from singer, indicating he knew how bad the movie was going to be, the other actors sway about genuine attempts at line delivery (swanson and quarry) or absurd imitations of classic movies scenes. mathius hues makes the most ham-fisted portrayal of dying since jim carrey's mask. all of this with no real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof by genre, period or any common vein is plain annoying. don't even try to join the dots with the plot. it is blade runner, thinly disguised with no content, actors or scenery due to a very limited budget. "you gets what you pay for" is never more apparent. there is repeatedly annoying re-use of limited sets, with no attention to set dressing and a spew of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for dr who in 1976. the helicopter explosion is worth a rewind to demonstrate my point. of course there are masochists that will lap up this tripe but if you are watching this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay rate. at $2 this dvd will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster.

my first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women, althought not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending

if you see the title "2069 a sex odyssey" in the video store, beware!! the cover has tori wells and three other "80's" porn stars, and has a copyright of 1986. if you're like me (and i hope you're not) you'll think "80's porn? tori wells? alright!" trickery!! it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars! there's nothing inherently wrong with 70's german porn, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting. once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket, i watched it anyway. it's a bad, bad movie. sorry, i guess i didn't really get past the rage.

four guys (jacks) go into the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense. they allow themselves to be abused worse than textile workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation. this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen. i just hope i can resell this item to someone who might like it. it is true that it holds your attention if you can let the illogical plot developments not bother you too much. it is very silly throughout however especially once a stranger enters the restaurant. who is he? guess.

on paper this movie has some chops: a street kid overcoming past trauma, rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off. great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending.in the theater though, there were some omissions that left the movie dead inside. the dialog was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone need to be gay? i have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it's used in this fashion not only is is offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and cheapens the movie. if the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut.every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form: each had one major flaw and one minor flaw, every character is good hearted were they succeed or not, and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone.the most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name "pip" comes from great expectations. they give it to you once and that should be enough. the story shares enough with the dickens classic to make this fact obvious.the most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for pip and how pip, the main character, learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. in the end, with lessons learned, pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life.

though not a complete waste of time, 'eighteen' really wasn't all sweet as it pretended to be. nor are the ages of the actors they're portraying  18, my butt. mckellen could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was 30 and ask us to believe it. even michael j. fox was more believable as a teen in 'back to the future' parts ii and iii (okay, maybe not; they're probably equal believability.) if you can get past the obvious age flaw, you'll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting (paul anthony's so called anguish, clarence sponagle's lifetime moments, and even though i do favor brendan fletcher, it's best to just watch him, and more, in 'freddy vs. jason,') incomprehensible scenes (a faster than britney spears marriage, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate, but still has one hand free  i'm guessing this was the writer's fantasy,) an entire movie of despicable characters (anthony might be playing someone that's 18, but acts like he's 12 and some odd "john" thrown in so anthony's character pip can save the day  was there really a sex scene in front of a baby?) and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions/scenes. on the positive side, i did enjoy ian mckellen's voice-over, seeing a (rarely well portrayed) straight/gay friendship, puppy love (from someone who collects stuffed puppies, that is,) good score, some decent dialogue (love the separation of gays and pedophilia  wish more people would realize that) and acting from the female leads (as well as cumming.) i can't really recommend it as it's really trying to be too many things  gay tolerance, gay hustling, homelessness, wwii epic, priesthood, first love, flawed judges, etc, etc, etc  on a shoestring budget.

how better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on tv? and i don't mean in the show cops; here, they're actually being presented as protagonists.i don't see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies. whitney houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star which bobby brown helped pull from the sky. bobby brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. why watch him? why does whitney stand by him no matter how despicable he is? this couple should be locked up and it's a loathsome shame they are making money and achieving a modicum of fame from watching the septic tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character.

a good idea let down by heavy-handed production.quite a bit of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the level of music/background sound, and this didn't help this reviewer. nor did the welsh accents, pretty impenetrable at times. towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue.this movie didn't know whether to be a farce or a black comedy - and they require different approaches. some of the incidents were laid on so thick that they only merited a groan, some were so unbelievable even for this sort of plot that they made the story just not worth following.the acting was in the main good - although the american just came over as a clone of the "back to the future" mad scientist. the little boy was very good.i did watch it all the way through but god knows why: i can't remember laughing once.

and i may be being generous. the overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped footage...the shambling monster, two women exercising, the shambling monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, the shambling monster again, none the worse for wear despite having been injured...you get the picture. i restrained myself from yelling "get on with it already" on several occasions.and it doesn't help that the footage they used was poorly produced. the sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. and in the one scene where they tried to get "artistic" with the lighting and camera techniques, the lighting guy, holding the flashlight that provides the scene's only illumination, is clearly visible in the shot.my hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to release it anyways, cobbled together from the editing room floor, in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the *real* film - the one with the plot and the interesting dialog. sadly, there's no evidence of this, and i'm forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of joel and the bots, they just didn't care.

following the world war ii japanese attack on u.s. forces at pearl harbor, "the eastside kids": leo gorcey (as muggs), bobby jordan (as danny connors), huntz hall (as glimpy), david gorcey (as peewee), ernest morrison (as scruno), and bobby stone (as skinny) want to serve their country. but, both the u.s. army and navy reject them as too young. still wanting to "knock off about a million japs", the "boys" attack an asian clerk, who turns out to be chinese. the unfortunate incident does, however, lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty japanese and german people.if "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only mr. jordan and mr. stone would be rejected for military service. but, it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by mr. gorcey and mr. hall. "let's get tough!" was made during what the script accurately describes as "open season on japs" - for this and other reasons, it hasn't aged well. it's a wasted effort, but the regulars performs ably, with tom brown moving the storyline along, as jordan's spy brother.*** let's get tough! (5/29/42) wallace fox ~ leo gorcey, bobby jordan, tom brown

propaganda pro-american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they're too young to enlist. ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust. the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent asians really did get singled out during the second world war. overall though, it's a pretty generic effort and both leo gorcey and huntz hall would have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they ad-lib.

let's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they made. full of awful racist jap talk and jokes, this east end kids story details how the kids want to join the military to defeat the japs. since they're too young, they decide to clean the town out of those dastardly japs. they find one, throw fruit at it (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls a short sword out to menace them! the cops say to stop annoying him! he's only chinese! he's on our side! when the kids go back to apologize, the chinese man's dead! it's all part of this huge jap and german spy ring! the kids see to it that this is stopped at all costs! i'm sure all of this was fine when it was made (1942) but viewed now, you realize of course, that this is clearly a product of it's time. full of stereotypes, german and japanese. funny how the east end kids have a black kid in the group, and he's not spared either. gee whiz.

ok. well, i guess it was worth my time sitting through this *once* but i won't be watching it again. there are several things about this film that irritated me.first, man...i really hated the characters. i had the same problem with sid and nancy. i have a hard time rationalizing spending a fair chunk of time following characters who i really don't care about, and can't relate to. it's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; it was that the characters were written in such a way that i just had contempt for them, and as the movie went on, i almost wanted to see the sky fall on them. and this leads me to the second problem, and a question which i think is at the heart of this movie: was the intent to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians who were (i guess) wandering around europe in the 60s? was the intent to criticize and lambaste them? or was this film some kind of a warning? my final assessment of the film (that is to say, in determining if there was anything salvageable here at all) hinges on this question.regardless, these characters are really unlikeable, and as a consequence, it's hard to really give a crap about the plot or what happens to them. if this was some sort of statement on this generation, then the film becomes a little more tolerable. it is clear that schroeder is not some kind of geriatric establishment square, so the way he proceeds here carries more weight than, say, the countless stupid aip films set in or concerning the 60s counterculture.at bare minimum, this film has two things going for it - first, the soundtrack (obviously). i like how cymbaline is used here and others have mentioned it too, as it takes the forefront in the movie. i am guessing that if you are a pink floyd fan and want to see it for that reason, nothing you read here is likely to stop you from watching it anyway (it wouldn't stop me either). the curiosity of hearing pink floyd in a movie may be enough to just barely get you through this.secondly, there is some nice scenery. ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. maybe i'm just sick of looking at los angeles, new york, and chicago in films, but european films which take the time to actually show us europe (the beautiful or the ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome.but i really see no particular genius here. no revolutionary camera work, not even a moral, tone, message, sensibility, or plot that has anything new to say. perhaps what was revolutionary about this was merely that it came from a guy like schroeder - a film critical of a mindset that at least in part made his movies marketable. to that extent it is an honest film; there's no glorification of the abject excesses of the 60s here, which is perhaps something you might expect. in fact, the portrayal of the characters in this film closely mirrors the (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) modern cultural memory of that generation.oh yeah, bunch of (yawn) nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch these kinds of movies from this time period. i guess it was considered novel or provocative or something at the time. i don't find it offensive or titillating (i doubt you will either); rather it just extends the running time of an already tedious film. in its own way, this particular use of sexuality in movies of the time (especially european ones) has become a bit of a cliché. but i guess in hindsight you can't blame them; they were just in that decade able to "get away with it" and i suppose (i'm guessing here) the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself (that being that sexuality was a part of life that this generation wasn't going to be all weird about like their parents were).should you watch it? if you're a pink floyd fan, sure...i guess it's worth a watch. in any case, the valley is a better film. i went into this movie expecting largely what i got. if you don't normally watch these kinds of arty, avant garde films and don't know what to expect, this is bound to be annoying as hell. this is a normal, healthy reaction :) if you're not a pink floyd fan, i'm not sure why you'd spend your time here. i noticed one fellow who left a comment did enjoy this movie quite a lot, so maybe i'm just missing something. i don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions, or anything like that to enjoy a movie. but i do need some kind of handle - i need to find something to like about a movie, and generally i need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters' plight (barring that some novel film-making will work; camera-work and so forth). here, there's just nothing to hold on to except for pink floyd's magnificence. which is *just enough* to make this tolerable. at bare minimum, if you're a pink floyd fan to begin with, you'll like the bit with cymbaline, i promise.

specks of white and various shapes, a beautiful nude, random images. that is what this little experimental short film is.it's kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film, but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films, and a fascination with the bizarre, this film just didn't do it for me.i'm not sorry i watched it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, i don't get it. visually, it is not that outstanding, in my humble opinion. as an example of dadaism, i suppose it would fit in quite well, since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, though i would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting way.but to each his own.

it's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting. there's some good work here.unfortunately they suffer from what afflicts much of modern gay cinema; recycled plots, too familiar devices (i have seen the "pool" setting way too many times in gay male films) and hackneyed scripts. most egregious of all is "dorothy" whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable availabe gay guys in his vicinity.in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials. not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution; basically they follow a point-and-shoot, shot/reaction shot/master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes. there's hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes, sadie benning and the late, great marlon riggs...but not here. these films are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility. which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.

i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb, but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn't go down to -10.all i can say abou this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. i don't mind the stupid jokes. i can live with the silly story. but when i see those dumbly grinning "main characters" with their pseudo-foreign speech (only germans will understand what i talk about), i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of. (if they had left them out, the thing may actually have been acceptable...).there's not much more to be said about this one. you may laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but that doesn't make it any better. it is definitely not funny.if you live outside of germany, be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas.if you do live in germany, avoid this movie at all costs.

this is one of the worst movies, i've ever seen. not only, that it is a comedy, which isn't funny, but it's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects.the two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot, that they touched each others genitals all the time. but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal, by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the "heroes", which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their "joyful" lifestyle (!). but i hadn't expect anything better by director michael "bully" herbig, who also made two not funny tv-shows, a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf-comedy movie. but erkan and stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up programs. for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel, who is very beautiful to me.

now don't get me wrong, i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around. it's part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant: ogling the belly dancers. but it doesn't make much of a plot.my first major problem is the music. i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote "the vampire lestat", the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though i could be wrong). i know relating to current "goth" music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrific job incorporating it. lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice. that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking.second, and someone else said it, mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. "lestat" could have been a movie in it's own right, and a damn good one if done right. i honestly don't think "queen of the damned" lends itself to a movie very well. though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story, there's too much, how to word this, "inaction" in the book for it to be a very interesting movie. and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly. now mind you, it's been a long time since i've read it, i always thought "lestat", "tale of the body thief" and "memnoch the devil" were much more action packed and would have made better movies.i know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture. i tend to agree with them there. aaliyah had a nice body though.

leatherheads is an apt title, however a leather strap would be more useful to self-flagellate oneself after purchasing a ticket to watch this noxious attempt at entertainment. clooney's attempt at self deprecating humor comes across with a quiet thud as his demeanor implies that he is anything but. perhaps with another actor playing the clooney role, the movie might be marginally palatable. sorry george, i doubt there will be any oscar nods this time. george clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy (unless you are referencing to his politics). anyway, only the most ardent of clooney fans will enjoy watching leatherheads, everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture.

check out the two octogenarians who review leatherheads. these guys are old-school hollywood and a hit on youtube. they always give an insightful and fun review. they have movie comparisons that are really interesting and they have a banter back and forth that is endlessly entertaining. they know movies, collectively they have been in the biz for practically a century. lorenzo is a well-known screenwriter and marcia is a famous producer. all of their insight on movies always leaves you with something to think about. see what they think about clooney's latest...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-w7evbears

how many times must i write the words boring and not funny on this page until i get to ten lines. george is about original an actor as alfalfa from the little rascals. although that is probably a slight to alfalfa. how many times do i have sneak into these overpaid actors crappy films before i will learn that there is but one law in the movie industry. take the money and make a movie - even if it is crap. they spend millions making this movie but can't take a few moments to watch the end result. and renee goawayzigger should stop taking the illegal drugs she is on and seek medical help for the facial problems she is sporting. at least i hope its drugs as she is quite unattractive whilst talking out the side of her mouth. this movie was neither funny nor dramatic and these hacks should just stop making crap like this. george and renee, you should be ashamed of yourselves and stop being stop stinking greedy.

i thought this movie was going to be good. it absolutely wasn't, despite the oscar-winning lead actors. i may have laughed once, and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing. renee zellweger's pancake make-up was very unbecoming. everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off. i think perhaps the movie must've sounded good in development, but something got lost in translation. were the roaring 20's really like this? i think not. everything seems a tad artificial. randy newman's score was annoying. the film is in sepia tones, just like every other movie that takes place in the 20's or 30's. there's just not that much originality here.

a lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film. ok, it had about as much to do with the actual nfl as your average war movie has to do with an actual war, or a western has to do with the true "old west". so, i think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one.the problem here is, the director (clooney) apparently thinks that making a screwball comedy means a) do stupid things, b) mug for the camera, and c) take stupid scenes full of mugging and stretch them out way too long. screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but moving briskly along at all times. here, things drag, and drag, and drag. after you watch this movie, it will make you appreciate how brilliant mack sennett was when he pretty much pioneered the genre with his keystone cops. after 90 years, you would think that directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two, maybe even improved on things a bit. but no, it's as if someone had watched an automobile pioneer build a duesenberg, and nearly a century later, paid homage and "improved" on the concept by cobbling together a child's wagon with square wheels.i've enjoyed several of clooney's movies, i consider him a gifted actor. but very few actors can competently direct themselves; clint eastwood notably took a while to get the hang of it. clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. the movie becomes more watchable during the very few times he is out of the frame, but when he's in the picture, he makes himself the centre of attention. in the fight scenes, his mugging is so obnoxious you wish somebody would thump him for real.if you are making a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in, you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female leads. clooney and zellweger have all the chemistry of pair of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. no spark, no sizzle, not even a post-mortem twitch. zellweger, who has also turned out some pretty good movies, must have traded her botox injections for oak tannin, giving a stunningly wooden performance. she might just have pulled off the "tough broad in a man's world" act if just once, while trying to out-testosterone the guys, she had looked into the camera with a little half-smile and twinkle in her eye. but no, she kept her jockstrap cinched up tight to the very end.of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie simply isn't funny. doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. doing stupid things very inventively, like the stooges, or very athletically, like buster keaton, can be hilarious. but otherwise it's boring and, well, stupid. i think i got one good laugh out of the entire movie.avoid this one. i saw it for free on cable, and still wanted my money back.

'leatherheads' tries so hard. tries to be light hearted. tries to be a comedy. tries to be a love affair. let's see, it tries to be a 'his girl friday' by way of 'the sting' by way of 'it happened one night' by way of a dozen sports movies. alas, trying isn't doing and the movie is as soggy as the last game's field.a fan of movies would watch the big fight scene in the speakeasy between the duluth bulldogs and some soldiers and realize that the fights that john ford staged with such style and verve and humor in movies like 'the quiet man' or 'donovan's reef', or 'the searchers' may have seemed easy to do but obviously aren't. i would bet george clooney thought channeling john ford would be easy as well. how hard could it be: masculinity run amok, punches, bottles broken over heads, an imperturbable piano player...just put it up there on the screen with some happening music. sorry. it takes a master to make fight scenes flow.movies aren't wished into existence. humor is hard. romance is hard. slapstick a lost art.i once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. something about not wanting to prick the fantastic bubble of the performance by hearing the thuds of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the lifts. this movie is like that...all strain and good intentions, handsome actors, nice sets, but it thuds through its paces rather than gallops like the original galloping ghost, red grange, who the movie is loosely based on.

i cannot comprehend how this picture was allowed to be made. it is mostly, if not completely, inaccurate so much so that the main character does not even resemble how history has him look physically. this movie made me go on the internet and go through my books to make sure i remember nero's personality correctly. for god's sake, i have a book that lists nero as one of the most evil person's of the world and the movie made me feel bad for him. i must say aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. although, the actors all did a good job, the movie was terrible and i'm sure i will not watch any others made by this sorry team.

sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie. but, i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster. the directing is really awfully bad. but, after i looked up its information here, i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing. maybe they don't have budget, but anyway, ang lee's sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit. the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself. it keeps pulling me outta scenes. maybe someone need to work hard on story line/ board. the dubbed sound is also awfully bad. my god.... normally, i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual. but, this time i am just mad , "i really wanna hit something hard." ...just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best. bad arts (its' not even art, what is it? )really hurt people.

"imperium nero" is the second movie of the series of six productions named "imperium". i have already unfavorably commented the first one: "imperium augustus". this second tv movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the italian state owned network has the same defects. in addition contains a considerable number of historical errors. some examples: nero is a child and agrippina calls him: "nero, nero". at that time is name was claudius. he was named nero after his adoption. nero did not meet acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with octavia and his nomination to emperor. when becoming emperor his sons where not adults: britannicus is one month old and octavia one year old. and many many more. if you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples. "imperium" series will continue with four more movies : "titus", "marcus aurelius","costantinus" and"the fall of the roman empire". finally!

for a good take on the roman empire watch the excellent bbc produced miniseries "i, claudius". this just sucked. the acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. hans matheson was irritating. cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated viewings. even caligula was tame. i think this film was silently supported by "religious" groups who shall remain nameless ;). the overt tones of christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if that gives any hint. stay away what ever you do - the running time is so long that i was able to read harry potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe.italy has done better - don't let hans cute face fool you. he is not a great actor...he is a great bore.

"nero" as the title of the movie is in germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting roman emperors, lucius domitius ahenobarbus, better known as nero. although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate nero than the amusing but completely fictitious nero peter ustinov played in "quo vadis!" it still is a major failure. and to those imdb-commentators who still believe that sueton and tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about nero that was published less than 20 years ago. nero did not burn rome, this is proved! he did not murder britannicus. he did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who banned the gladiator fights. the movie still shows a lot of mistakes, errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like some villa, the city itself looked like..well like a cheap set. the acting was between good and sub-par, the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after nero became emperor to a rushed, bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure. so there still is the potential for an epic biography of nero that shows the true nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled rome, despite the lies of sueton et al.

perhaps, we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen. perhaps, we expect too much from these films. however, if we, as viewers, are offered far too little, what happens then? that is what i thought after seeing imperium - nerone by paul marcus, a part of the production series on the roman empire. augustus by roger young, the first imperium movie, included at least peter o'toole but what does this movie include?hardly anything accurate. the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history. throughout the movie, we see nero young: young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula, young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own (historically 14 year long) reign. and...he dies the same. according to the movie, nero, born during the reign of tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies... continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie, which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable. nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. at that time, his mother, agrippina, is exiled by caligula. later, however, she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina. at these moments of the movie, we see acte (rike schmid), nero's mistress. all right, it is historically "accurate"; yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome. in the film, she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul's miracle (he brings a young girl marzia back to life). besides, there was, historically, nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula's 4 year long reign (a.d. 37-41). i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! and many, many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy.as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment, they are equally lame as the history here is. the performances are artificial, the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. perhaps, i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead, but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all. he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor. is he an artist who burns rome for a song? is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives? is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of "alleged justice"? none of these. he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and, in the long run, begins to release the fire burning within himself... john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character. elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea; yet she could have been much much better. the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze. low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment.but what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, i give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:- the death of poppaea and st paul's talk with nero at her dead body, - claudius' mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death), - tigellinus killing agrippina (laura morante), nero's mother, - nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, - finally, nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte "let us forgive him"all in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire. it's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been made at all.

what a disaster! normally, when one critiques a historical movie, it's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in, usually added by the writers to create more "dramatic" situations. however, "imperium: nerone" is a whole 'nuther kind of animal. in this movie you strain to find anything at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of rome's bad-boy artist-emperor.and it's a pity, because nero is one of the most fascinating of all the roman emperors. his life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie. the producers of this mess chose another route, which leads only to head-scratching on the part of any informed viewer.just a few examples: 1. nero is depicted as an 6-8 year old boy when caligula has his father killed for treason, exiles his mother agrippina, and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside. "ten years later," the story resumes just before the assassination of caligula. facts: nero was born about six months after caligula began his four year reign, and was only three when he was assassinated; nero's father died of natural causes; agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior, not treason; and nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family.2. okay, according to the writers, nero is now about 16 when his great uncle claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress messalina and marries claudius, who adopts nero. then he goes off to conquer britain, and is poisoned by agrippina soon after his victorious return. nero is declared emperor, although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old. fact: claudius conquered britain in 43 a.d., two years after beginning his reign. he lived until 54 a.d. nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology, but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16.history tells us that there then followed the "five good years," where nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher seneca and the praetorian commander burrus. this is shown -- sort of -- except that portraying the roman senate as opposing nero's good measures is false. senatorial opposition to nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing senators for real or imagined treason.3. nero's mother agrippina is the controlling sort, who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son emperor. after a while, nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her. in the movie, he sends his henchman tigellinus to stab her to death. all true enough, but the reality was so much better! agrippina was a survivor, and didn't go easily. nero tried three times to poison her, but as an old poisoner herself she was savvy to all that, and he failed. then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber, but that also failed. next, he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink; as it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam to shore. finally, he had her stabbed to death. now showing all that would have definitely improved this movie! other errors abound: nero's lover acte was not a childhood slave-friend, she never repudiated him, and there is no evidence that she became a christian. nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake. etc. etc. etc.the sources for nero's life are primarily the roman historians tacitus and suetonius, both of whom were of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory. but the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with the common people, unlike one of the final scenes where he is pelted by the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide.why did the writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie, and make this piece of crap? oh, and did i mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were? lol.one star, because there's no way to rate it lower.

i just attended a preview screening of this film. a masterpiece of documentary film-making it was not. totally absorbed with its subject, the film becomes incapable of leveling any sort of critical commentary with regard to ms. faye. cloying and sappy, the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt (albeit a failed one) to structure some kind of narrative. but the creepiest experience occurred as the closing credits rolled. the audience rose and applauded. like moths to flame, americans in the 21st century are still drawn to freakshows. the narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting rather tired.

i walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins. i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder.as soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, i sensed something was wrong and it wasn't long before i to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment. i'm not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature, but this one suffered from a catalogue of bad directing, bad acting (bar 'bruno' character & the impeccable jean rochefort -according to my friends),awful editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time . the worst crime was its overall insipidness and unbelievability (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). why was it so awful? i do not want to waste more of my time explaining. i'd say go and see it for yourself but i don't want to fill the coffers of this project any more than necessary. oh, the screening did possess one redeeming feature: my friend cambering over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself -more pathos, tension & entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 mins of this sadly dire effort.

sorry, but i usually love french thrillers - e.g. chabrol - but this was a glossy shambolic mess. the fact that it was based on a harlan cohen book is telling, because rather than being a french film (strong on psychology and character), it's more like a john grisham-esquire roller-coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists, flashbacks that update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!') and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies. by the end i was laughing hysterically at the unevenness of the film's tone (the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two streetwise shady characters are unintentionally hilarious), the utterly baffling plot, the absurd coincidences and strokes of good fortune (e.g. guessing the password for an email account) and yawning uncontrollably (thought i must have misread the 1hr 50min running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes).

first off, if you want to make a good film, don't cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes. the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours, only to have margo's father explain everything to alex very late in the film. to make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved, but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about (involving alex's father!).there's some serious motivation issues with characters also. margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over. why didn't he just kill philippe's father and be done with it? instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted, but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who gets murdered by philippe's father's thugs). although alex is a doctor (whom one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, during which he not only endangers his own life, but those whom he involves in a nasty pile-up on the freeway. why was margo's friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo, once all the crap hits the fan for alex? and are we to think that margo's father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison? what about his wife? did he consider her wishes? those are some of the main problems.then there are some nasty details, like: why was her father there the night of her faked death? how did he get a hold of the junkie's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two? alex's friend bruno seems over-eager to be part of the mayhem, in which he and his friends have to kill for alex, notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son's life. what good would the photos of margo do? they don't implicate philippe at all. and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her would-be abductors to take? did i miss some other things? probably. minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor, he smokes like a fiend. which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive. also, when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer, neither of them is wearing a seat belt. how bright could they be?

according to most people i know that saw this film and to the reviews i've read this was supposed to be a hugely entertaining thriller that oh so needs to be seen by more people. i didn't expect this film to blow me away but i certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre at best, which is what it is.i'm no stranger to french films being both french and having studied them as a student so i'm aware of the clichés and corny plot twists that can go unnoticed by english/american audiences. there are some great french films that should have been given widespread international release but this isn't one of them.to begin with the plot is both far fetched, over complicated and too smart assed to be entertaining so you really feel every minute of its 2hr and 5min run time and by the time everything is finally revealed you are beyond caring. the main character himself is lacking any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime close to the crap ending so by the time you've even considered swallowing the main plot twists it's begun to dawn on you that you've wasted your time! i actually remember switching off before the credits actually began to roll after the film's climactic reunion - that was the point in which i was sure i had almost completely wasted my time by the way.the film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated. for instance i read somewhere that it beats all the bourne identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has 'wall-to-wall tension'. i can safely say some people are hyping up this frankly dull movie.4/10 is a generously considerate rating for this film i feel, and since i have seen some complete and utter stinkers, i'll therefore save the 1s, 2s and 3s for them.

martha plimpton has done some prestigious movies, working with river phoenix and harrison ford, but she was never able to expand her limited, tomboyish appeal into the same class as, say, molly ringwald. this film, which was barely released, is just an extension of her late '80s/early '90s attempts to find a screen-persona which was identifiable to moviegoers, and it represents another failure. plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and--worse than that--was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep! she sets out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to (would simple curiosity give her this much determination?). unattractive material given sitcom handling; it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. plimpton gives a sour, surly performance, but hector elizondo and mary kay place are fine as her adoptive parents. *1/2 from ****

let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not plan nine or cat women. it is bad, period! the performances vary from drama school theatrics (marla english) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (tom conway). the photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. the real problem, however, is the aimless, pointless, nearly plot less story and the leaden, paceless direction. at a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless.the screenplay is especially inept. there are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. tom conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which he can control telepathically. he is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working, in the expectation of gold and jewels. when they finally arrive, tom conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. she is turned into a monster, kills conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. she sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. the white hunter rescues the wife. in the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!).the aip producer, samuel z arkoff, in a lecture included on the dvd, prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. however, it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. what appeal do they think it could possibly have? the monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. the jungle action is tepid and tedious. there are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with.the producers exposed 77 minutes of film, but they didn't make a movie. this is a con trick and arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.

this 1950's howler is so bad it's unintentionally funny. tom conway portrays dr. gerard, a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo. his poor wife, played by mary ellen kay, is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. along comes marla english as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. her idiot boyfriend, portrayed by lance fuller, is along on the safari. they hire "touch" connors, (later renamed mike connors, of mannix fame) as a guide. english is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either. "touch" (i'm sorry, i can't even type the name without cracking up, i mean, what the...) gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that's saying a lot. the monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. i would say this movie falls into the "it's so bad, it's almost good" category of movies. it's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube.

let's face it, this is a pretty bad film.however if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience.okay, you'll scream in agony a lot.african jungle fun in a dopey kind of way.tom conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau) is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being.it looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress.ugly is being kind.but it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject.he needs a bad bad girl.marla english and lance fuller are two petty crooks in search of african gold.acting lessons for ms english should have been at the top of the search list.she's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.mike "touch" connors is the white guide english & fuller con into leading the expedition.english & conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell.she is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.you will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.what made this movie interesting for me was conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.truly bad cinema.

at one point in this waste of celluloid, charles dance as some sort of meant-to-be-funny, cyborg bad guy says "if i had an anus, i'd soil myself."quite.

you've got to be kidding. this movie sucked for the sci-fi fans. i would only recommend watching this only if you think armageddon was good.

okay,i realize that there are some doubting thomas's out there...i was one of them...but then i saw this masterpiece of celluloid.all i can say is that the scene in which george wendt gets sucked out of the spaceship by his a** left me trembling. i sometimes sit bolt upright in my bed, screaming like an old man on a proctologist's table thinking about it. if the director is reading this... i would pay to be an extra in the sequel.

i'd never heard of this film before i caught it on the telly last night. i do hope it was never given a cinema release as this would be an insult to the silver screen and movie-goers alike.was it supposed to be serious, was it supposed to be funny? why the outrageously basic plot? does anyone actually care?...awful film.2/10

oh dear! ohdear!ohdear!ohdear!i love science fiction but this... er... 'movie' just puts space flicks to shame. every sci fi film i've seen over the last year has been disappointing to some degree, and i'm now seriously reconsidering what genre of movies i actually like in future!! (maybe i'll watch romance flicks from now on!) spoilers alert! (and thats not saying much!)this flick is so insipidly dumb it rivals battlefield earth and baby geniuses in sheer badness. the special effects are obviously fake, the big mac truck looked stoopid with its roller coaster seat restraints, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the power rangers, a huge fat guy is sucked out of a port hole window butt first and... space truck school??? wtf?mr hopper can do better than this. what really stunk were the two good-looking young things who accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants (??) for an entire two thirds of the flick! the obligatory 'sex scene' (snicker!) between our young heroes was so poorly performed i nearly choked on my tonsils laughing at the tv screen.the only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain/cyborg/mad scientist. he oozed the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy, but i believe he could've been much more menacing. he does and says things which are quite funny (all the best scenes involve him!) so for the captain i give this movie an extra point.but this flick is so bad it'll make you want to hurl abuse at the tv or maybe throw your tv out the window! it may even kill off a few brain cells and put you into a catatonic state.conclusion? i like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his peg leg when its obviously a fake peg leg!! i would've given it 0 out of 10, but since he cracks me up with his stoopid antics... this flick gets 1/10!

dennis hopper must've been really hungry to do this movie. atrocious special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid-looking killer bio-robots. never mind the blatent disregard for science. the awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off. the best part of this movie was the pull-start cyber-penis on the wacked-out cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because i'm in a generous mood.

i must admit that this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i thought dennis hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of yeeeecchh. if this is supposed to be funny then i gotta look around for a new sense of humor. if you're thinking of buying this movie you'd better think again.

square pigs as a way of efficiently utilizing cargo space is the one and only clever moment in "space truckers". believe it or not, dennis hopper has done worse, see "the american way", but this movie is way up there on the "cream of the crap" scale. i think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that "space truckers" will please no one. too cartoon-like too be taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor, and poor character development, virtually assures disappointment. the beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing, but all others have been warned to avoid "space truckers" for all of the above reasons. - merk

cheaply-made, poorly acted, and unimaginatively directed, flight to mars still is entertaining despite what its has going against it. a flight to mars is planned with five people(three older gentleman, cameron mitchell as a newspaperman, and one female scientist/obvious love interest)"manning' the ship. the spaceship gets there and finds that very human-like martians live there and have technological advances that would make earth blush. but all is not rosy in the subterranean cities of the martians(here shown as some caves and a few rooms). the martians are a dying planet and one faction wants the earthlings to fix the ship only to take it away at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on earth and another faction wants to talk peace and see if they cannot persuade earth to give them living space. the special effects here are pretty lame even for 50's sci-fi standards complete with slow-moving rocket ship, pastel/neon alien garb where the women wear shorts that would make many blush(except the men of course), and little less offered. cameron mitchell is the journalist and is affable if nothing else. marguerite chapman is beautiful in very short shorts but adds little acting range. the rest of the cast is filled with some older sci-fi veterans like arthur franz and morris ankrum doing serviceable jobs. this isn't a premiere sci-fi film from the golden age by any standard, but it is very watchable and zips by at fast pace.

obviously influenced by the success of pal's "destination moon" and lippert's "rocketship x-m" this one just doesn't make the cut. limited special effects, a thin story line result in a production that even the half-decent cast can't save. just no believability here. no one seems surprised to encounter martians, much like earthlings, etc. etc. pass on it!

early 1950s sci-fi directed by lesley selander. special effects of course are very primitive, but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then. drive-in movie double feature fare; still interesting enough to watch. two leading men, arthur franz the brilliant young scientist dr. jim barker and straight talking and earthy newspaper reporter steve abbot(cameron mitchell)are joined on a manned flight to mars by carol stafford(virgina huston)another scientist and two other space experts(richard gaines and john litel). upon landing on the red planet, the space travelers encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced. in actuality, the martians are led by ikron(morris ankrum), who has the idea of conquering earth to vitalize their civilization. there is a beautiful martian(maruerite chapman)that dr. barker intends to take back on the return trip. she is the movie's redeemable element.

it is said that there are some people out there who actually admire monogram's movies. well -- and why not? monogram studios lived on a kind of cost plus basis; cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while. sure, they're cheap. but let's face it: they're coarse, fast, philistine, vulgar, but exhilarating. they have no pretensions at all. they're designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill. so what if john wayne gallops through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles? this isn't art, it's entertainment.take this movie, "flight to mars." at the beginning, when we're first meeting the characters, a man might introduce his female companion abruptly, avoiding any tedious subtlety: "professor, this is my fiancée and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. she loves me but is growing impatient with me because i'm always wrapped up in my scientific work. perhaps you could steal her from me, marry her, give her the babies and the picket-fenced home she yearns for. if necessary i will die on this journey to see her dreams realized. also, she likes it a little rough." it saves a lot of writing and shooting time, doesn't it? that's what people mean when they say a narrative is "fast". (this one was shot in five days.) why should we have to hint about these things? i mean, what the hell is this, a cheap sci fi movie or henry james? actually this is a particularly well-funded example of a monogram movie. it's in color, for one thing. "cinecolor" to be exact. (you can tell it's not any other "color" you'd recognize.) and look at the cast. the female lead is dismissible, as is usual with monogram, but the male leads are definitely up there on the b list. cameron mitchell as the reporter, yet to hit his stride as a male lead, which, come to think of it, he never really did. and arthur franz as the pipe-smoking head scientist, the pride of perth amboy, new jersey. and -- for science fiction fans -- how about this pair of aces: both morris ankrum and john litel! there's not really much point in describing the plot in detail. the five crew members crash land on mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts. and they picked up english from listening to our broadcasts. american broadcasts, that is, judging from their speech. they're led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship, build many imitations of it, and colonize earth. they do not succeed.the special effects aren't very special. the men walk around a couple of spare sets, wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them. their names consist exclusively of english phonemes -- alzar, terris, ikron. the lissome martian who falls for arthur franz is named alita, with an indo-european diminutive appendage, and she already knows what kissing is.overall, i found it as snappy as it was intended to be, but dull too. the story is that of any buck rogers 1930s serial. once the earthlings and the martians meet and it's established that they have a common language, and that the martians have a sinister agenda, that's it. in two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of nazi spies in world war ii. the plot is done by the numbers, the dialog has no sparkle, the acting is pedestrian.however, dedicated aficionados of monogram productions should enjoy it. after all, jean-luc goddard, the contrarian french egghead, dedicated "a bout de soufflé" to monogram, so they can't have been all that bad.

this movie is overrated, to say the least. it's not good as a comedy, and it's not good as a "serious" film either. the pacing is far too plodding for the former, and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter. the only laughs come from some of bud spencer's reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother's behavior. the dubbing is excellent but the full-screen framing is appalling. (*1/2)

very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did: it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old.seeing it more than 30 years later, it's still okay, but it only mildly held my interest. what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing.also, things that were astonishing to me as a 10-year-old came across as just silly. for example, in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking. in fact, he doesn't even bother to look and see if they're dead, because he knows he hit the mark. um, yeah, right.in addition, a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden. sorry, but 35 years later, it hasn't really aged that well.although it's been a long time since i've seen that one as well, probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody.

i am testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me amnesia i have a dubbed to english version of this movie. now let me go down the points music score: bad quality but at least it suits story: it's about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for farmers land from a major and he allies with mexicans to drive them out and trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend it - the final climatic fight scene will confuse anyone about who the #### are the good guys conclusion: better than i thought but i need to continue with this i am next going to watch the dolph lungren and jean-claudde vanne damme movie "universal soldier" pray for my sanity

from the late teens to the 1920s, stan laurel was a solo act in films. during this time period, laurel was definitely not among the upper echelons of talent and his humor isn't nearly as good as contemporaries such as lloyd or keaton. however, for second-tier short comedies, he did create a decent niche. as far as the quality of the films go, they varied wildly. some, such as dr. pyckle and mr. pryde, were terrific, whereas most were of average to below average in quality.frozen hearts is an odd film. like many of the films he made for hal roach and distributed by pathé during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film looked very nice. however, despite this and having support from the likes of james finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. none of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. only the really silly intertitle cards betray the type film it's supposed to be.my advice is try to see all his laurel and hardy films and then see the solo films. in addition to dr. pyckle, try seeing the soilers and mud and sand--two of his more tolerable solo shorts.

i purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store, as they cleared out their tapes in favour of dvds. i doubt they'll be replacing this one, somehow.i couldn't say that it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, but it's very dull. no real cannibal scenes. me me lai is not naked enough of the time (only about 4 or 5 times). and she's not the thai goddess that i expected, either. so two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out.there is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing. a great fight between a mongoose and a large snake gets quite bloody. animal torture, as well, some of which is real and some fake. thankfully the fake is somewhat funny, but the real is just a little sickening.generally speaking, it's a 70s film - overly long, under-developed, not as deep as it would have liked to have been. but it's something different, right? one and a half stars!

no shortage of female flesh but still not interesting! lenzi at least is capable of so far greater probably peaking at spasmo and starting with kiss me kill methe hard gore r2 dvd release may be cut at 86 minutes, but this movie contains one act of cannibalism and one victim - a scene with a native girl who is brutalised and disembowelled by the cannibal tribe we are warned of and who later set fire to some huts. arsonist holocaust? firestarter fernox anyone?certainly not a cannibal flick but was there ever a decent one made? avoid.

ruggero deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with jungle holocaust in 1975. but director umberto lenzi, usually acknowledged as a deodato rip-off, directed the man from deep river 3 years earlier in 1972. is it a worthy start for the genre? well....not really.....a photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and while retreating into the jungles of an asian country, is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive, force him into slave labor, and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter. throughout the whole film, i never felt this was a horror film. it was more reminiscent of a drama, like a man called horse, which i liked better. ivan rassimov is pretty good as the photographer, but it is me me lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great. i have always been a me me lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in jungle holocaust and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films. she is still very talented and charming. lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about deep river that could make it a horror film, but even that doesn't execute well.the man from deep river is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre, but as an entry in the genre, is easily eclipsed by deodato's entries and even lenzi's own later entries. recommended only for completists and me me lai fans.

storyline drags. drug smugglers a beautiful women and a determined cop. nothing not already done a hundred times before. the boat sceen will be well worth the wait amsterdam is the perfect city to pull it off. the canals and waterways put you on the edge of your seat. i would say the same as did the car chase in bullitt, very intense!.

looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex, this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer (or in this case director) geoffrey reeve.and it's a doozy. laughable on just about every level.some government agents (i think) are "professionally murdered" in amsterdam and a considerably less-than-charismatic, block-of-wood interpol agent (who i assure you is not named louis salinger) is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax-dodge financiers get their money's worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location.the wannabe-hard-hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried, but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what's happening regularly in horribly contrived direlogue ("were you followed? oh no of course not. no one outside washington even knows you're here!") yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing. by the time a sinister vladimir putin lookalike priest (no less than kronsteen from from russia with love) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off, which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol, and him shouting "you bastaaaard!" at his friend's murdered corpse, and the leather-bound, moustachioed go-go boys, the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs. only the climactic boat chase impresses. it's an exciting, well-directed sequence that really has no place in this movie. such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - reeve had nothing to do with that sequence! thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous, spit-out-your-drink twist and warehouse shootout.unless such a wretched thing as a geoffrey reeve completist exists - and you're one of them - i wouldn't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense.

i have to say this, this is the first movie i'm reviewing on here i didn't finish watching. i mean.. i couldn"t continue! no matter how adamant i am for watching things until the bitter end, 'the ballad of the sad café' proved no match to this viewer. vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on. anyways,. a long lost relative comes to visit, he's a midget and well, that's as far as i got. what the heck was the point of all of this? i didn't even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on, as i was already pummeled senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role. i call this coffee table cinema. the type of cinema that appeals to just a scant few of you, but the others just stay away.

this movie was ridiculous from the start. let me save you all time from watching this movie. a woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes in her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a café downstairs from her home. she does and she and the cousin become close. there is a scene later where she is locking lips with him. later, the woman finds out an old boyfriend is coming back from jail and its tense between them, leading to a down and out fist fight in the café. the woman's cousin/nephew is enamored by the man. the ending was awful, the story was awful, and if i could get back the time wasted on this movie, i would appreciate it. a definite skip.

"the ballad of the sad café" worked hard at its image, but when it came down to crunch-time, it was left standing in its own self-created dust.one cannot image saying this out loud, but if vanessa redgrave's amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood, my hard-earned dollars would have to go to redgrave. her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi-million dollar contracted persona. redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard-earned woman from the south. to the average viewer, this could be construed as annoying, but as the film progressed it became her  miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck. it was redgrave's performance, as well as her interaction with the other characters, that made this film stand tall  but not the tallest. the others following her performance were needed, but not stellar. as we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the post-depression south job, the minor characters felt like poster board. the image was needed to set the scene, but the characters of the town had no other purpose. take for example rod steiger's vision of some old, wild spoken preacher. his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off-the-beaten-path town. the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene-stealing moment, but due to the lacking direction  it just seemed faded. the most absurd of the two (albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line) is cork hubbard who plays amelia's "cousin" who shows up randomly one night. his character is never quite defined, he lacks true motive, and his loyalties remain uncertain. he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us, the viewers, to question his sanity and honesty. can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue, flicking your ears, and punching your chest and head? finally, there is the other end of the absurd  keith carradine. callow's close-ups of this tormented man build character, but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder. these were the characters, as cliché southern as they were  some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece, and i cannot argue that they failed.where "ballad of the sad café" failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative. this film was about amelia, and her need for other souls in her life. the audience's level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining  one couldn't help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart. cork hubbard's character is never quite understood, but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together. it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona-fide café owner. the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave  is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelia's family? i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynch-esquire relationship that they had. then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelia's "love interest". using the technique of a flashback within a flashback, we see the two wed, but never consummate their love  which amelia's anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness. why was amelia so angry? why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave? why was this even in the film? with the lack of focus towards these characters's connection, the eventual scenes between the two made no sense  throw in cork's choice and it just gets completely discombobulated. while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created, the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b. i lost focus, interest, and my care for the characters plummeted when i didn't understand the ultimate question  "why"? overall, "the ballad of the sad café" began with a bang, but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker. my emotional feel of this film swung up and down, up and down, and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters. redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia, and while the other characters (outside of the random steiger) tried their best, i just didn't quite understand who they were. their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred, i was apathetic. director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players. callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery, which allowed us to focus on amelia  or carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. the film played out with anger, discover, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, fade out. without the comparative connectors, this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera. it was a shame, because "sad café" had the promise, it just couldn't deliver.grade: ** ½ out of *****

how do you make a totally unappealing movie out of a story by one of america's most famous authors? watch this film and find out. maybe i am overrating author carson mccullers, but i was impressed by "the heart is a lonely hunter" and was hoping for something memorable here, too. forget it.vanessa redgrave looks like a man with her short haircut and clothing. i never found her much to get excited about in almost any movie, anyway. rod steiger as a preacher? how insulting is that? unlikable characters, one after the other. well, maybe that's the book, too, and i am being unfair to this film. i am not familiar with the story other than what i saw on screen and this was so unappealing a movie that i could never recommend it to anyone.it's just one backwards person after another in a backward town. outside of some nice cinematography here and there, there is nothing to recommend. how anyone could sit through 100 minutes of this is amazing.i didn't even go into how bad this is directed. there is good news: this was the only film simon cowell directed.

when one considers that carson mccullers is one of the foremost literary figures of the 20th century, it seems that it needs a very great lack of talent to be able to ruin one of her stories, but this movie shows it can be done! how do actors ingratiate their way to becoming directors? wooden, unatmospheric, unsympathetic, totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of mccullers' writing, my jaw dropped with horror and disbelief that such a mish-mash of a movie could ever have found finance and backers. the only redeeming features are some moderately good acting, (although that said, vanessa redgrave seems to permanently render much the same performance whatever character she plays), and some good cinematography in places, but otherwise it is a bitter, bitter disappointment, and it could, and indeed should, have been a contemporary masterpiece. simon callow should hang his head in shame and stick to acting!

arguably the most disgusting thing to come out of australia since vegemite... predictably distasteful comedy with barry humphries in a dual role as boozy australian diplomat les patterson and undercover agent dame edna! so many bodily function gags that even the farrelly brothers would have been sick, and several gross-out moments, especially the effects of the horrible h.e.l.p. virus. only for fans of extreme toilet humor. oh, and that´s the "neverending story ii", not the "mad max" george miller, who directed... *½

the brilliant australian comic genius barry humphries had a rare failure with this uneven, and occasionally distasteful comedy, which was snatched back from release after only a few days. drunken, lecherous australian diplomat sir les patterson accidentally sets an arab potentate on fire at the un and is posted to his tiny country as punishment, arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader (american soap star thaao penghlis) on the throne. sir les, with the reluctant help of dame edna everage (both played by humphries) almost accidentally foils a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly, disgusting, aids-like virus on the western world. joan rivers has a cameo as the female president of the united states, her desk plate reading "president rivers"! extreme bad taste mingles with slapstick and humphries' usual scathing satire in a film which is more enjoyable in it's many funny parts, than taken together as a whole. dame edna's tv fans may be puzzled by the presence of a different madge allsop, sadly, one who lacks emily perry's wonderful drab comedy magic in the role. the film was written by humphries & his third wife, diane millstead, and directed by the mad max man himself, george miller. for die-hard humphries fans like myself, essential. all others, beware.

it's a shame barry humphries infamous sir les patterson character had it's film debut in this under cooked spy/comedy.this film reminded me of the beatty/hoffman stinker, ishtar (1987). humphries should have learned from the mistakes that film made - if your going to change gears on a concept don't use spies! like ishtar, the first 20 minutes or so offer a promise of something different. it would have been great to see the anachronistic and boorish patterson sleazing around in the world of australian politics. one of characters even point out that patterson is of date with the current times - you'd think humphires could of had a field day making commentary on the hawke government (i can just picture a scene with patterson and hawkie in a drinking contest). but instead of a film that might of been clever and even a biting look into that world, we get patterson running around the world as james bond trying to save the world from bio-chemical weapons that runs out of steam before the half way mark.disappointing.

to start, i'm not a person to rate movies that i haven't seen, nor am i a person that rates movies 1's when they don't deserve it. this movie was really that bad. the basic plot was extremely formulaic, and while it wasn't great, the plot deserved about a 5. the part that really bothered me was anything referencing swimming in the film. i compiled a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this film.1. no character development. 2. no sense of time. 3. completely inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: a. a team of six swimmer going to something called both "nationals" and "regional" with no mention of how they qualify. b. this same team going to whatever the hell this meet was without swimming a real meet at any point in the film. c. the rival program goes from being a high school to a club team back to a high school and then a club team again. d. in the scene where ellis is interviewing for a job the banners show high school state wins and placements at nationals, yet the team consists of anywhere from 5 to 12 swimmers depending on which of the 3 meets are happening. e. a team of 5 guys and a girl win nationals/regions whatever. f. said girl wins a men's 100 butterfly event. g. in this race, said girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top 3 in the nation. h. the announcer changes a race from the 200 breast to the 100 breast back to the 200 again in the span on about 45 seconds. i. in the final relay, the 4x100, which is being swum in a 50 meter long course pool, one swimmer is seen doing two flip turns. j. in this same relay, the teams anchor swimmer freaks out and steps off the blocks, prompting an inspirational pep talk, which lasts for about two and a half minutes, or about 3 times as long as the leg would take at a national caliber meet. k. the movie begins in the month of july or august, assuming that ellis was applying before the school year started, and the pool was to be closed in 3 months, so assuming these things both hold true, the swimmers went from not being able to swim to winning nationals/regional whatever, in less than two, as the pool had to be cleaned and the kids didn't start practicing for a while. l. i'm sure there are a couple hundred more, i'm just trying to block them out of my memory. 4. throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmers time. 5. if you're going to have a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire extras that know how to swim well. 6. the scene where the kid is kicked underwater is physically impossible.that being said, all the swimming scenes were way too slow, swimmers had horrible technique, and the idea of being able to qualify for a national meet within three months of learning to swim is just insulting to swimmers everywhere.ok, if you still don't believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst films i have ever seen, and this is coming from the guy that owns gigli, soul plane, manos: the hands of fate, skullduggery, and any number of other total piece of crap that have been put on film. please don't go!

inspired by a true story tale is full of 1970's feeling but is disjointed in the telling. this is the tale of a black college swimmer who ends up in phillie at a closing rec center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts together a swim team. the film staggers around blindly for the first half hour until terrence howard, as our hero, gets the kids into the pool.it picks up at that point by becoming somewhat engaging, though it still staggers about. there is a good story in this and its clear why howard and bernie mac took part in it, but the script is poor and most of the direction seems intent on making it feel like 197something instead of making us feel anything for the story.not the disaster that some reviews made it out to be, it instead suffers by all of the recent sport true stories-coach carter, invincible, glory road, etc, which at least knew that you have to at least work with the story to make a movie as opposed to just letting the audience suffer because "its true".

it's important to keep in mind the real meaning of the phrase "inspired by a true story" when watching pride. it's sort of like "you could save up to 50%," which can quite literally be translated to "you can't save more than 50%." it all sounds great until you realize that the lower part of "up to" is "zero." similarly, "inspired by a true story" means that someone heard a story and it made them think of this one. the only certainty is that the real story and the one you're about to see are not the same thing.there is a real jim ellis that began coaching the swim team at the philadelphia department of recreation in the early 1970s, but i have a feeling that the real jim ellis must not have been able to conceal some feelings of disappointment at the way the movie turned out. clearly, it takes wild liberties with the story of his life, and i just picture him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so much different than the man they know.at any rate, one thing that he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by terrence howard, one of our finest actors, who starred alongside bernie mac who, despite the lack of an original and powerful story, still gives a heartfelt and moving performance. the movie takes place in 1970s philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and the educated and professional jim ellis, who is also an accomplished swimmer, is having trouble finding a worthwhile teaching position, until finally relegated to a falling apart recreation center, which he is assigned the task of cleaning up before its demolition. we can certainly understand his feeling of belittlement. when we first meet elston, the maintenance man (bernie mac), he is a disillusioned grump who sits in his office surrounded by piles of junk that touch the ceiling and watching daytime tv on an old, dusty television set. needless to say, when jim shows up to start cleaning the place up and clearing it out, elston is not exactly friendly with him. he knew his rec center was being closed, and all his anger about that transferred quite smoothly onto jim. given his past as a college swimmer, jim takes a special interest in the pool, which he cleans and fills and brings to top shape. a group of black teenagers who play basketball just outside the rec center take interest in the pool when their basketball rim is taken away and the heat remains stifling, and soon the group have a developing swim team on their hands, which they enter into a citywide swim meet. to call them underdogs, of course, would be something of an understatement. they're unorganized, unprofessional, insufficiently trained, and have no idea how to behave at a swim meet. that doesn't matter, of course. the movie is your standard underdog sports story, so the first athletic outing is totally unimportant as anything other than a learning experience, a catalyst to drive their much harder and much more focused training that will lead up to the final athletic outing, the one that matters. by now, the only thing a sports movie has going for it is that the protagonist(s) do not have to win at the film's climax, we only have to understand the meaning and significance of their effort. sadly, the movie has all of the character development of an old seagal movie. the good guys are the good guys because they're just supposed to be, and the bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who laugh and jeer and make racist jokes at our team. oh, and there's one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while in the middle of a race. i didn't know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that, but you get the idea of how deep the character development is.we understand that this is the group of kids that jim ellis turned from kids hanging out on the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers, but other than that we don't really get to know anything about who they are.but the biggest problem is that the only real statements that the movie makes are that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad. both of these are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary. racism was so much more powerful in america in the 1970s that it feels like an enormous loss that the movie dealt directly with that issue but didn't really say anything about it. it's sort of a feel- good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much it should have said is much bigger than what it said, the feel-good sensation turns into a sad disappointment.

after some internet surfing, i found the "homefront" series on dvd at ioffer.com. before anyone gets excited, the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago. the resolution and quality are poor. the images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the abc news program "nightline", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.to this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. everyone was believable and really looked the part. their acting was also above average. the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong). the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor. the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time. for example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago. despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. for one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. when wwii ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a "homefront" either. curiously, the first episode of the show "homefront" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. that's like shooting the first episode of "gilligan's island" showing the castaways being rescued. the whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. by the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. the show is set in river run ohio, near toledo. however, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio. part of the ensemble cast are dick williams, hattie winston and sterling macer jr. who portray the davis family. much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil "whites" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years. we get it. we're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for "homefront". the acting talents of williams, winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical "frightened / angry black family". the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something. the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.in yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (ken jenkins) is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.personally, i think this series had great potential. the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to europe or the pacific. the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. but no, the writers of homefront (david assael and james grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.

hideously bad movie purportedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up casino life. moves at a snail's pace. dull, dull, dull! virtually everything about this movie is amateurish and unconvincing - with one very notable exception: the performance of clive owen, who is like a rolls royce purring through a slum. advice for the casino sequences were allegedly provided by a professional but judging by the way in which they are handled they were completely ignored by the director. while casino staff may very well be a different breed to the rest of the world they are nowhere near as witless and booooring as the characters presented in this script. odds and ends are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide it with convincing background but would appear to have been jotted down in a list on a cocktail napkin. for anyone who makes a living in the casino business (as this writer has for the last forty years!) this is a poverty stricken depiction of their world which even in the farthest and most obscure reaches of england has never been this wanting! an appalling, insulting mess of a movie that plods and plods and plods along to an idiotic and unconvincing ending. american critics loved it.

this low-budget film about a writer who goes to work in a london casino has an awful script, wooden performances, and not much to recommend it. of course it will appeal to highbrows for whom "mainstream" is a curse word, and who automatically add 20 iq points when they hear a british accent (apologies to jeff foxworthy).the script is full of holes (has he written a book yet, or not?), cliches (relationship trouble: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little insight into such basics as character motivation that it requires a voice-over narration just to move the story along.in an attempt to keep the audience from dozing off, it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of julius caesar.if your idea of scintillating dialogue is "i'll see your ten, and raise you twenty", then run to see this movie. otherwise, save your money.

it is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of george c scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by graham greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre. not to mention a better cinematographer. there are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over, rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel.elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site, one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. ever since i saw george c scott as rochester in jane eyre, i have prayed for him never to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a british accent. just every now and then, he could just possibly pass for british or a very british sounding south african played obviously by an american actor. i can stomach meryl streep's extraordinarily laboured accents (both british and australian) - at least she gets it right even though with every utterance, she demands that we marvel at her skill. well, i am sorry that mr. scott is no meryl streep, and it just destroys the illusion - like having michele yeoh speak excruciating mandarin with a strong singaporean accent in crouching tiger etc.peterson acts no differently than what we see on csi. except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie. he is the harrison ford of tv. same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. no on second thought, ford has two - perplexed/pained and happy. i have never seen a smile on mr. csi!

what is wrong with curacao ( also known as deadly currents though what the reasonn for the name change is i have no idea ) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover :" keep it down baby , i'm trying to sleep " it's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered , it's the fact the actress has has a central european accent . nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states ! this what struck me about this thriller while watching it - the way accents don't match their characters . apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent , a local police chief who sounds like he's an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who's either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african . you soon give up following what's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . it's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin . with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations even if you're not curious about accents or dialects you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because curacao is plot less . things happen like a boat exploding , and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to . i was lost

"curacao" is a foreign intrigue drama set on the title caribbean island which involves a retired sea captain and bar owner (scott) and a demoted cia field operative (petersen). the film has numerous bad guys, foreign agents and thugs, skulking about the pair of protagonists all coveting something scott has which they want and are prepared to kill for. a lukewarm low budget tv flick, "curacao" is spiced up with a couple of babes and use some carnival street parades as window dressing. little more than fodder for the bored couch potato. c-

strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context, the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing, the clear attempt at dry/black/dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke.with a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio i was shocked this show went pass the first season, i personally like scrubs, the office, 30 rock, trailer park boys, pulling, peep show, simpsons, family guy and i know what your thinking, these shows aren't weird at all, so some other good shows i've seen are jam, garth marenghi's darkplace, the book group, asylum and snuff box which are original with dry/black/dark humour/satire and are all at least 5/10.garth marenghi's darkplace especially is cheap looking, overacted and weird, however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too.

i attempted to watch this, and was highly disappointed. don't expect intelligent and insightful humor ala amy's brother david amidst this dreck... it is the polar opposite. but if you're into poop, fart and boner jokes, you'll be in seventh heaven. this is bathroom humor aimed, i assume, at those who've had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as "the best television writing ever." i assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review, but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high-end comedy. the characters overact. the shock factor is set to 10. and the laughs are set to zero (unless, of course, you seek juvenile, low-brow humor.) i made it through 40 minutes, praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment, but alas, it just got worse and worse. and beware of amy's ever-present and hammy overbite expression - it will set your eyes rolling. it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy, but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the sedaris family.to those who loved it, i'm sorry... this is my opinion. it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review.

necessary roughness (1991) was a bad comedy/ drama that tried to hard on every level to be a serious film about college football. a lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights. other than that it's a very mediocre movie. they should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism. instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick. when will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic?not recommended, unless it's for free on t.v.

this movie is allegedly a comedy.so where did all the laughs go.did the forget to put them in,on the version i watched.as a football movie,it is mildly entertaining,i guess.maybe'm just a stick in the mud,with no discernible sense of humour.or maybe this movie just isn't funny.it is also annoying,with that way over the top "you're a winner"musical score.and the odd thing is,the team sucked through most of the season,only winning the last two games,and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the playoffs.so what is the point? are they celebrating mediocrity?i don't see it.if anybody knows,please let me know.anyway,this movie isn't great or even very good.i'm giving it a low 3*

this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on. this has to be the worst football movie ever made. this has to be one of the worst movies period. the premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. this movie isn't even a half a star. bad acting, scott bakula sinks as usual, larry miller?? sinbad, couldn't act if he tried. rob schneider's one liners completely stunk. fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower, not even close. a complete waste of time and of film. if we could give a negative number, minus 9.

this movie was such a waste of my money. it was disgusting as well as disturbing. honestly, i would never recommend this movie to anyone. who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog?? seriously... it was a waste of my time. i kept watching the movie, hoping it would get better and a plot would emerge but that never happened. i'd rate the movie an f-. this movie should have been rated r for its disturbing nature. i would never let children of any age see this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is horrible. this movie was a waste of my time. i could have spent the night doing some worth my time instead of renting this movie. this movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it. pretty much, no one should watch this movie. this movie should be banned and burned.

spoilers, beware!!! flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. some things do confuse me about it (e.g. jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; alex replies "about 25 years," isn't alex supposed to be 18?) and some things do fascinate me about it (i loved the spins!). overall, though, it intrigued me. when this movie was made, i wasn't even born. i didn't really experience the eighties (i was born in '85) and i have to wonder: sometimes alex would just run in place a bit, or throw herself all over, not really dancing, just banging in to things, tossing her head back, and waving her arms-was this considered "dancing" back then? if it was, i'm not sure i could've standed it. the spins, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of it-my neighbor's toddler could've done better! also, if alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? when she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off? living in a warehouse-i can almost see it, but not quite. it doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, and is trying to get into ballet. none of it really makes sense. i shouldn't be too judgemental considering my own background, but please. maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, i don't know. but either way, they could've picked a better actress. the actors were fine. i even liked the romance. you make your own decision. but mine is-rent it once, don't see it again-it isn't worth it.

i registered with imdb.com just so i could comment about this movie. my god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was! it shouldn't even be touted as a real movie, this is very deceiving. this is a 15 year old's film project at best. the acting is terrible. but even good actors could not save this. the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie. who the hell wrote this crap? and that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about kaye being a "damsel in distress" got old real fast. god i'd rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again. do not rent this movie. if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it. smash it with a hammer. even if smashing this video caused you to lose your hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it. this is an abomination. i suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant. any questions....email me.

this movie obviously had good intentions. at the end there is a dedication to someone named kellie who, as a viewer, i can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts. perhaps she made the "wrong" choice. that dedication is the only redeeming quality of love & suicide.the movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film, it's pretty much going to be downhill after that...which it was. i know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good...unfortunately, everything else was horrid. the acting, the plot, the sound quality, the picture quality...the acting. i'm sorry but the acting is horrible. beyond horrible. it's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting. that's the only way i can think to describe it. as i watched, i actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind. none of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit. in short: the timing is way off. the timing of the entire film is way off. i'm no director so i know the limits of my knowledge but i really feel there had to be some way to convey the passing of time...until they explained about graduation not being too far away i was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week...a month at most.all that being said, it's really a shame. this movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking. all the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set-up is obvious (which is a bad thing). the moving scenes totally fell flat. for instance, when kaye's brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers, we should feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brother...somehow it just doesn't come off that way. there are so many more scenes like this (for example: all of the fight scenes) and all they do is take away from the movie. all these things put together, love & suicide comes off as one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.

my friend and i rented this movie for 3.99 at blockbuster. if i'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be, i wouldn't have paid a cent. i had no warning for this bs. the acting can't even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is awkward, and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the male villain... god, who couldn't tell he was going to attack emily and the musical cues... my lord. this movie makes me want to cry. never rent this. in fact, if you happen to look upon it, gauge out your eyeballs. this movie isn't of god- it's from hell. i'm just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah shiz cause i really don't want to continue on with this review.

i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on.so, imagine my delight when i discovered love & suicide while browsing netflix. echoing heavenly creatures, an easy choice, to the top of my queue it went.i watched it last, made myself comfy, and waited. what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student's prank film project (i laughed out loud once or twice, thinking "that just lowered the bar of straight to video") turned out to be the movie. horrible acting, amateur direction, weak dialog. i usually enjoy low budget films, there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the "meat" the acting, the direction, the plot, the story. i would liken it to a student who hasn't studied for an exam goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleeps.in someone else's hands the plot would have serious potential.do not expect magic or even a cult classics like, say, divine's polyester, or showgirls, at least there you learn to expect bad acting.love & suicide went from bad, to worse, to the worst movie i have ever seen.

ok, i don't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie. just the way the scenes were edited and the acting, it made me cringe at some points. i really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film, they must have had the smallest budget. i really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful. also, why is it that in almost every film with lesbian characters one of them has to either commit suicide or die or turn straight?!?! this is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. i gave it 3 stars and everything considered i think that was very kind of me. only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad it is.

yeah, i made it all the way to the end. it was pretty hard though.sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set. the acting...well, i don't even know what to say. i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring, sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog. i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100-minute-long audition tape. i'm not even going to talk about the ending...the best thing about the movie was the music.that being said, i do not recommend this movie to anyone. even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch overall, this is nothing to waste your time on. if you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, check out the children's hour, lost and delirious or high art. those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won't have to suffer cinematic hell in the process.

this movie has good intentions, at least in the message "don't be afraid, no matter how tough it can be. fear will kill you in the end" it's a good message, but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting, complete lack of credibility in the feelings, dialog that's delivered as if it were read out loud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people.it abuses from effects such as slow-motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus, a lack of emotional force...the suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low-budget film from the pre-90s, when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) an utter incapacity of live good, happy lives, and a tendency to get caught in over-the-top dramas that often involved separation, death, or prison. had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it (and not according to how others think we should live it), it would have being less dramatic, more inspiring. but it doesn't, it focuses of pain, on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal.i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection. if you're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel, go back to the magnificent "desert hearts" (even better: read the novel!)

just once, i would like to see koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director, and producer! just once!this is a good attempt by jean leclerc and chris sarandon, and an even better attempt by victoria tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. the screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing koontz's work this way and the director...please.the story is a well-written story, but the screenplay is quite dull, unbelievable and horribly executed. the only elements which work are the performances by leclerc, sarandon, and tennant.on a personal note, i really wanted this to work. i adore koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing, and talent they deserve. if they put the same money into koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into king's, koontz would quickly rise above. but alas! without powerful people who believe in his work, i fear he will never get the chance.as an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total suck-fest. as a stand alone movie, it wasn't that bad, though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut. this movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. had they followed the original work by koontz, a bit more closely, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a far better endeavor.however, all i can manage to see in this, is how good it could have been, and wasn't.it rates a 4.3/10 from...the fiend :.

i actually saw the movie before i read the book. when i saw the movie i was upset because i wondered why dean koontz had made such a bad book/movie. the movie was confusing and didn't have a flow at all, it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the tv. i couldn't connect with the characters at all, so i didn't care about what happened to them(normally i love the characters because i can relate to their personality or problems). then i read the book and loved it. i often re-read the book, and the movie is collecting dust. i wish someone would make a koontz movie that follows the plot of his books, then the movies wouldn't suck so much. do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money!

unfortunately, koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. whispers follows the original book very closely, seemingly until the production company ran out of money. all of the sets in the first half of the movie were meticulously recreated from the book - something which has been lacking in many other koontz films. despite its other (numerous) downfalls, i continued to watch in anticipation of some really great scenery. wrong. by the time the detectives show up at the crack head's apartment (in the book), the movie is out of funds, and one of the most suspenseful scenes from the book, is ruined. where the book offered grisly discovery, a search and a chase through the guys apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the guys car.let's face it - koontz writes without a budget in mind, because imagination is free. if a koontz novel ever gets made into a decent movie, no one will go and see it, because they have been let down so many, many, many times before. this is why dean koontz's frankenstein is now just frankenstien - if you had seen your work butchered that many times, you'd get out early if it looked like happening again!

one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema. wait, i take that back-- this movie can't be included in any category related to "cinema"; it belongs in categories like "waste", turds, or similar categories. ironically, it's even _about_ two garbagemen. the movie is "men at work", a lightweight crime comedy starring the estevez (sheen) brothers from 1990. setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slapstick, continuity errors, and high rate of no-name actors never to be seen again, all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway (at its core, i mean). it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn every line, and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your *wasted* friends, thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade class.to make matters worse, i actually submitted an imdb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to the movie's imdb web page, if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yet(about the butthole surfer statue). i'm so conflicted about why i should even *waste* my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note, when what i really want to do is blow up emilio's acting career (no, wait, he's already done that himself. thanks, dude!) i'm so glad i *wasted* only time on this, not real money. for that matter, can i maybe have at least one tenth of their budget? anyone other than this director (emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars, carefully placing bikini-clad bimbos in the background, and beating up useless extras (henchmen) in haz-mat suits. i'd mention emilio's writing credit, but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay "writing" -- it's more like crayon-scrawled cartoon ideas. and charlie sheen, if you're reading this, i assume m.a.w. must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a coked-up, hooker-loving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet. (oops! sorry, i guess that part of your life isn't over yet. get well soon, you "half a man". such a promising talent, so *wasted* oh look, there's that word again.)

i thought i had seen this film before as the plot summary sounded familiar. however, when i watched it one afternoon (in need of some mindless-but-amusing entertainment), i didn't recognise anything - if i had seen it before, i must have blocked the horror of it from my memory.this film is dreadful, and it shows its age. in fact, it looks older than it is: more like a mid-80s moronic comedy. whilst i am a fan of toilet humour and can see the funny side of many things, this is "comedy" at its most puerile and homophobic. the plot is as thin as a supermodel, which wouldn't bother me if only the film were funny.there is only one amusing line in the whole film, spoken by the character louis: "looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy!" in fact, louis is the only likable character (and that's not saying much). james and carl are the type of irritating, immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from, their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in iraq; the character of susan wilkins is colourless (looks like julia roberts, but lacks her charisma) and there is zero chemistry between her and carl - though it may be unfair to blame the actress, as i don't know what she could have done with such a poorly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable.there is good trash and bad trash. this is trash that definitely should not be recycled.

the fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper which i do not care for did, to a degree, put me off of watching it, but as i had come across a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing i felt i could watch it with a clear conscience.the film does have its moments, the evocation of the thameside location is nicely done, but it does suffer, i feel, from a few too many faults. firstly, vinnie jones is simply not convincing as the journalist. whilst vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the range of acting ability to pull off a role like this.secondly, who would carry around with them a lost manuscript that they have been informed is "priceless"? it seemed that everywhere mr jones went this manuscript went with him! thirdly, the whole dickens aspect of the story, whilst appearing to be important, gets in the way of what could have been an interesting film of corruption in high places. maybe i'm just a bit thick, but i really could not see the point of the story-within-a-story dickens style. this added nothing to the film, and only served to confuse matters when things started to become interesting within the modern day story line.the one bit of praise i will give the film makers is that at least they did attempt something a little different. i am all for british independent films that try to be 'out of left field', but this is not a 'red road' or 'this is england'. what it is is a bit of a mess, and an over-long one at that. yes, it entertains in part, but in the end it felt like two films merged together to make a whole, and failing both by doing so. (also, i can not help think that i have seen something similar done recently on tv by ian banks, set in edinburgh with a story concerning sir arthur conan doyle, the creator of sherlock holmes).

i didn't know anything about this dvd when i hired it. had a quick look here at the comments but decided to keep an open mind. obviously an independent film and low budget but that didn't worry me. i will watch anything with derick jacobi and as always he played his part well. what a pity no one else did. i had watched 'atonement' a few weeks ago with vanessa redgrave and she was sublime. in this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines. in my opinion the main mistake was in casting vinnie jones. to be honest i saw his picture on the dvd cover but didn't notice that he got top billing. a sticker was strategically placed over his name! it was watchable and i quite liked the dickens story alongside present day. maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better. still it was weak.

whoever saddled this piece of drek with a title like riddle deserves some kind of award; there are dozens of riddles here like who conceived such a dire project, who funded it, who cast it, who persuaded vanessa redgrave to share even one scene with vinnie jones and so on. the most sane voice connected to the whole schmeer belongs to the person who decided - very, very wisely - that this was unreleasable and not even good enough to go straight to video/dvd which throws up yet one more riddle, why - if we rule out serious payola - did the mail on sunday get involved and deign to give it away. this has golden turkey written all over it and smacks of being shot in two days in somebody's garage and cobbled on to some library footage of london except somehow you know that someone actually did shoot this on location when it would have been kinder to shoot him/herself. vinnie jones and julie cox are not even cardboard cutouts more like tissue paper and i swear pete doherty and kate moss couldn't have done worse whilst derek jacobi is a grotesque joke and the plot moves with the speed of the irish team sliding up the cresta run. apart from that ...

come on now. how did all of these talented actors/actresses end up in this mess? was it some sort of blackmail/lost bet situation? vinnie, you are a muscle man. be what you were born to be.the hot tub scene? the scrabble scene? i was expecting to hear the "needle dragging over the record" sound at any point. and what was up with him carrying around the priceless dickens manuscript with him? let's see, i'm drunk at a bar, why not pull out the priceless dickens manuscript? i'm going to meet some questionable thugs down on the edge of the thames, why not take my priceless dickens manuscript? crapola.terrible. avoid.

as i'm listening to my parents watch this (after i gave up 10 minutes into the film), they have absolutely no idea what is going on. when "charles dickens" stared into the camera, i half expected him to turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). unfortunately, that didn't happen.this movie had various reasons i did not finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. i mean, seriously, it was sloww. you can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters were poorly introduced.if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughs, and the same music/sound effects played over and over and over, then this is the movie for you...1/10 - completely horrible.avoid at all costs.

its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday, slow going, poor acting, and filming (camera flare, near start of movie, is not even artistic) = straight to video, but not in this case, why not recoup some of your (film production costs) by releasing it free with a uk sunday newspaper, at least this way you get a captive audience, and recover some costs.i have not given this film a 1 out of 10, due to the effort to pull some old actors out their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (vanessa redgrave,this an't no blow up), but vinnie jones as a lead, and i think he was better in gone in 60 seconds when he did not speak.this film is dropping in ratings every day,i think this will find its true mark at the 3-4 out of 10,in the very near future

the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made. the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money (a'la bbc) to keep luvvies in their life style they have been accustomed to, with doing nothing for it.the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes, it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt, gangsters, luvvies or gawd blimey jellied eel types, the story script was just pathetically weak, to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the "sweeney " theme i just expected it. the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney / minder rip off.the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldn't carry around in my breast pocket every where, to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film, poor bloke.when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens, oh my god, what a load of crap, and i am being positive here

this is a great example of what could have been a great film and a great idea but turned out to be really bad in the process. i was mainly tempted to get this because of the dvd cover, stupid me, but i did anyway and i was blown away, in a bad sense. this movie is essentially about el chupacabra wreaking havoc around los angeles and it's up to a local animal cop and a writer to save the day, before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists bring them down. the main reason why i did not enjoy this film was because of big continuity errors that were hard to not notice. along with some bad acting, okay lighting and nothing scary, this movie did not hit me as much as is it probably should have. however, compared to other chupacabra movies, this one certainly tops the charts, just barely.first off, the continuity in this movie is way off and i mean off the shoulders and into the ditch. there were so many points were the characters said or did something and then in the next shot, they aren't doing it or the change never occurred. case in point: the main character has a gun, the chupacabra attacks, he whips out a flair from nowhere and distracts and the gun in missing. the girl runs while he defends here with the mystery flair and she had no gun, then the main character is running with the girl and has the gun. where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun. the time of day gets screwed up. one minute it is sun set and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight. there were some plot holes as in, why was the chupacabra there, what were the scientists doing, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived? these things bugged the heck out of me and none of the questions were answered.next on the list is the acting. boy was it wooden and bad. the main character navarro, played by eric algeria, seems a bit too calm at points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy hits, his emotion was just not there. elina madison, who played starlina, did a fairly poor job. she was the author of a bestselling book about the chupacabra and she just didn't seem into her role or her performance. her acting was kind of laughable and a poor. even for an author she knows too much about that thing, and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory. tony criss was okay, but he seemed a bit to calm for some of the stuff that was going on. the movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for some crime solving show, where the actors and actresses aren't really that committed to their work.i rarely don't get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie, i could not help but be harsh on the lighting. it took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed. there were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comic bookish," but it backfired. the worse part is at night when it is pith black outside, but the scene is so oversaturated with light, it seems like its day. they keep switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors were squinting. it shouldn't be that bright that there are dark shadows at night. during the sunset when the lighting was perfect, that's the only time when the light was good, other than that it was terrible.there were not scares in this film. there was only one time where i did jump but other than that, it wasn't scary. there were points were it probably could have been scary but it was so damn light out, you could see the chupacabra approach the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. even the creature design for the chupacabra was poor, it looked good but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit. they didn't hide his face; they showed him with no sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance. there was a fair amount of gore, but it seemed unreal. this movie just wasn't scary, that's all.overall, they did americanize a great south american legend into a blood-thirsty human eater, which the chupacabra isn't. in fact, it was scared of people and it only killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans. but, then were would the story be? i did not enjoy this film for any reason, but i will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions. i would not recommend this film to any horror fan, but if you like indie or b-movies, you should check this out. also, if you are easily tempted by cult-classics, you'd enjoy this film. i didn't, i won't see it again, but in some deep sedated way, i enjoy these kinds of movie just to see what the other side of hollywood is making.

boyle heights, los angeles: legendary south american goat-sucking vampire, el chupacabra, is on the loose, feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path. animal control officer navarro (eric alegria) and chupacabra expert/author starlina divide (elina madison) attempt to track down the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops, money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward, and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments.stinking higher than a two-week-old taco, el chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through. with its dreadful script, awful direction (by not one, but two talentless hacksbrennon jones and paul wynne), laughable dialogue, and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick, i recommend this film about as much as i do drinking the tap water in mexico.as navarro and starlina proceed with their investigations, viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore, the worst designed book jacket in history, the most unconvincing dead person i've seen since the blinking corpse in dr. butcher md, and a high-tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post.to be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is fairly creepy (hairy, with big claws, and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are few and far between, with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney officer navarro than on the killer antics of the titular creature (just how many times is it necessary to see navarro handing in paperwork to his bitchy boss?).if, like me, you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned cash on this dreadful latino bilge (in my case, it was a whole 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it.

according to this masterpiece of film-making's script (pun intended), charles darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. for you see, aliens sent chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory. however, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that chupacabras are a typically puerto rican phenomenon, so i don't really know where that fits in. are they saying all puerto ricans are aliens? whatever, it's all pretty irrelevant anyway. the only thing you need to memorize is that "el chupacabre" is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur b-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. we have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice. since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the latino immigrants of the neighborhood. the monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody. the acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing. particularly eric alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of animal control. yes, it's an incredibly stupid film, but surely you have struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low-budget garbage.

this movie is a complete and utter waste of time, one of the worst films i've ever seen. and coming from me, that is definitely saying something. in fact, i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one-star awful.when i rented this movie, i had an open mind. i find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and i have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks. but i draw the line at this one.the acting sucked. the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines. the lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance, but that really doesn't take much.the chupacabra... well, considering how low budget this movie must have been, the creature was tolerable. it does, however, look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person, but not so on screen.speaking of on screen, you'd think they could have at least used a better camera. it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud. not a very good one, either.i don't know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking. the dialog sucks and just... i can't describe what i feel about it. at least not without getting in trouble with the site.my advice? avoid this at all costs. it's just not worth it. if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch, then *find* something else to do or watch. read a book, listen to music, *anything.* just don't subject yourself to this. if you do, you cannot say you weren't warned. and for lord and lady's sake, don't rent this sucker. it is not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. trust me, i know.

i really liked this movie. number 5, the star robot of the movie gets hit by lightning and some thing happened to his circuits. he act and thinks more like a human.the robot repeats commercials he learns after watching tv. he then applies these sayings to his circumstances. number 5 is quick witted and funny. the character imitates voices of stars, tries to dance like john travolta in staying alive and a lot of other things. he has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized. the actions of the robots is really good. number 5 wants to drive, cook and please stefany with all the characteristics of a human. the way the robots move and line up is really hysterical.i am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all viewers. this movie has a surpris ending something you would not expect. i hate movies that have swearing in them even though i like them i give them a lower rating. this movie had swearing words. jesus christ was used as swearing word which offends me it is used a least 3 times. g-d d-m, bull sh_t etc. it could have been a wonderful movie with out all this offensive language. there is no sex in this film, some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines.

i saw the movie in original italian. it must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the tv-generated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "that's real life"-productions and "let's-raise-our audience-with-a-few-tears"-screen-playwriting. the late massimo girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. the movie has some good hints, but (as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plot-lets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the tv productions, well known to italians. a few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag (charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see chocolat, babette's lunch, vatel etc.) hammam and the fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that ozpetek has learned the tune of italy in the early 2000s and is humming along... i'll give him a last chance though...

if this film was just outrageously poor would be fine, the problem is many take it seriously. to make it short, a few points: - there is no story, no focus, no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer. overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (i have been in war-torn african countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense).- questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements.- i am no doc filmmaker, but what's the point in raising, for example, the question of weapon smuggling, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? the director doesn't even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed.- the story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. did this guy do any work at all???? - abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point? one can go almost anywhere in africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately. where's the big news? - filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real tv.- the parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless, dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-western feelings.there is an interesting debate in france after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film, which brought number of journalists working in africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details. it turns out that: - the fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal-feeding purposes. i think i am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite.- arm smuggling is a reality (but there again, where's the big news??), but not the way this film explains the issue. if the empty planes landing in mwanza do participate in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different location in africa, then go to mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty (meaning that they do actually land empty in mwanza...).- people do eat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggest (around 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people make their living with it. good for them! it's private business of that kind that will one day take african countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance.i cannot tell how shocked i am seeing the success of this film!

i think the movie was one sided i watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance. the fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in tanzania alone and not because of this fish business, there prostitutes were there way before the russian and other business people arrived in mwanza. poverty is indeed endemic in africa let alone tanzania and this is not because of fish fillet business, in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life. this movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country. as for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker, it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really. yes tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world...what a load of rubbish.the pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to angola which is more than 2000km south of tanzania and the war was in drc also miles away from mwanza, the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from mwanza to drc!in short the films lacks focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in africa and has nothing to do darwin's nightmare or fish fillet...what a load of rubbish!the truth is the nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25% of all catches from lake victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right.

my mom and i went to see this film because my brother is serving in the u.s. peace corps in the same region in which it's set. halfway through the film, i decided that given its failure to measure up to what it pretends to accomplish, the title is pretentious. the subject it deals with could have made for an excellent documentary, but because of its poor execution, it left me far less educated about the issue than i had hoped to become. i agree with laura-jane from canada ("powerful message but lacks focus."). i also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker's narration-free style is the opposite of that of michael moore, but i don't agree that it presents varying points of view and invites the viewer to decide for him- or herself. i do agree with one user's comment that "a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves"; however, our conclusions can't be anything but poorly founded if we are presented with little relevant information from which to draw them.the main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1) the african people who live near lake victoria are very poor and suffer greatly. 2) the introduction of perch to lake victoria, inflicted by europeans, ruined its ecosystem. 3) the communities surrounding lake victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy.the best things i can say about the film is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub-saharan africa, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly among films, and that it attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon. i liked the irony it captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a famine. i appreciated the portrayal of how out of touch the u.n. team assigned to the region was with the people. like almost all documentaries that don't have the word "women" in the title, this film fails to do a good job representing women's voices -- the majority of the talking done in interviews is that of men.maybe i need to watch the film a second time in order to catch some key points i might have missed, but i failed to detect sauper's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to lake victoria and the unjust living conditions for africans living near the lake. furthermore, i could be wrong, but it struck me that sauper could do well to improve his interview skills. not only did the questions he asked and the responses he included seem to be arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real knack for making interviewees awkward and uncomfortable.the most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the exportation of perch now functions to mask the importation of arms and that the real economy screwing over tanzanians is that of war, not fishing. sadly, sauper shies away from conducting a thorough expose of the idea (or at least extending the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in regards to the weapons importation) and cops out with a "decide for yourself" approach.if darwin's nightmare was meant to dispel the myth that first world exploitation of the third world gives them "a chance for a better life," it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to depict how the weapons manufacturing industry in the u.s. and europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to cast light on the inability of the u.n. to carry out its mission, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to say that meager income tanzanians earn from the perch isn't worth the human cost of tinkering with mother nature to create a profitable product, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to imply that tanzania would be much better off had europeans never come, it didn't do a good job of it.

after having watched darwin's nightmare, one must have the impression of tanzania being a living hell, with its population being quasi-slaves delivering the finest fish to the well-fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population. in exchange for the fish they get western-made weapons, which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use, because being a soldier is their only source of income.so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery? not quite. fortunately darwin's nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects. in fact, the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region.for the countries around lake victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income. the wages in the fishing industry are way above average. tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen. the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level. cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories' exports and profits. furthermore tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish, which still play an important role feeding the local population.by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the african's situation.for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative-wing newspaper wrote on the subject: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013.1/textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text

this documentary was boring, and quite stupid.i mean... the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works? it is a theory, and the name is just plain dumb. reading a college biology text-book could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is. darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is done as politics.also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people... no expert testimonies, and shady leads...the documentary was also boring. i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes, and then it would have been lots better.there are a lot better documentaries than this... this was not worth watching... you can get better information from wikipedia =d don't waste your money and time!

the title of this documentary is very misleading. at no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the nile perch fish into lake victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of mwanza, tanzania. the film tries to place the problems of tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force. the documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever. instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter. there are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the nile perch fish. one is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the nile perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. the film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. the second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the nile perch has introduced, and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become. the subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most african countries. the film tries to link the introduction of the perch fish with aids, poverty and pollution in tanzania but never makes a direct connection. as any intelligent person well read with problems in africa, the problems shown here are not unique to tanzania but affect most of africa and have nothing to do with the fish. it would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don't. the fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. yes things are bad within the town of mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.a weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. first off tanzania is a very large country and lake victoria is only a small portion of the country. many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. this documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the nile perch. it plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and aids making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the lake victoria region of tanzania or directly related to the perch fish. the fact is most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and christianity than and environmental effect of the perch fish itself.

i'm sorry to say that, but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seen.due to its name "darwin's nightmare" i expected a documentary on problems relating to the nile perch in lake victoria.what i actually saw in this "documentary" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake. and for a large part you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection...why does this movie waste time on: - showing us non-relevant information on the families of the russian pilots (several minutes are wasted for example on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile (as if that could not have happened without the nile perch) - showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport - showing us strange religious events for several minutes - discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - talking to kids about their mothers, fathers - what they work and/or how they died (well, guess what: some died of hiv - who would have guessed that?) those are just some examples, i could go on for several pages...this movie is absolutely unfocused, and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer. if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has social/health/hiv/violence/war problems then this movie might be right for you. if you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades 90% of what this movie shows won't be new to you - and the way it's presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep.perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high, but i really didn't like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting. if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the nile perch, than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter...

when exploiters become evangelist, they still exploit in the name of poverty! my first reaction after seeing the movie is  god bless me that i am not eating fish or any non-vegetarian products! the documentary is about lake victoria of tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live, and one day during 1960s somebody came and injected the mighty fish perch, who became the exportable commodity for tanzania to european and japanese markets. the consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial/ business/ capitalist sense, so it is filled with arms and ammunition (that is what europe can give this world); thirdly the pilots (as all migrants and traveling population like truck drivers) has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local african prostitutes for them; fourthly the brokers, dealers, middle men in the chain (mainly indian origin business people) get richer and tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs etc.the premise to make this documentary was excellent. but has the director hubert sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? it is a big no. i say the reasons: like in india, it requires a higher caste brahmin to stand up and project to the world, indian poverty and untouchables; similarly it requires an austrain born european documentary maker to tell the world the story of tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. it is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class (who have never seen poverty or known poor), who survives, live, earn and fame like pest hanging on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it. there is nothing more but despise by poor people in african and india who see such images of their.the intention and motives of the hubert seems totally lop-sided. the images, characters, locales, interviews are too grave and murky, dark and disturbing. he uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. what we feel in the end is pity and sadness for africans. we also start considering the tanzania government and people as villainous. may be some westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of africans, but there would be nothing more than that.the director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the europeans who exploit this poor country.this director hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like today's cnn and bcc media giants. hubert did not have guts or common sense to talk to any europeans who eat or companies who import these fish products. a totally lop-sided flimsy effort! but i understand the reasons of the same  hubert just wanted to rake his fame, sitting and smiling with awards in his european comfort.no more words to spare for this pathetic effort. i hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish ill conceived director made solely for un-intelligent western audiences! (stars 3.5 out of 10)

movies like this give independent films a bad name! this simply a boring compilation of vingettes, with no structure whatsoever. i wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned. if you want to see a good stoner comedy, watch "half baked." it's no award-winner, but at least it made me laugh. the film was obviously made on a micro-budget. every scene either takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location. if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, i would've ignored the film's budget (like in the case of edward burns' films), but obviously that's not the case this time around. i quote robert deniro from "a bronx tale" when i say, "there's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent." everybody in the cast is talented. luke wilson, alicia witt, brittany murphy, jeremy sisto--all talented performers! and they all have been in much better movies. the actors give it their all, but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script. the only scene i found interesting was jack black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. and of course, there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning, which i also found appealing. the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists. many movies are awful, but at least you understand their intentions. what was "bongwater's" intention? the world will never know. my score: 2 (out of 10)

the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence, but it is not good at all. one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all. every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things, except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before. i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies. the film is sad, not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast. if it were redone and written over it could be awesome. if you want a good movie to see stoned, watch grandma's boy, or half baked or dazed and confused, but this is not a movie to be seen at all.

this film was one of the worst films i have ever seen. this movie drags on and on and i almost turned it off, but i gave it a shot. i wasnt expecting anything great, but i was expecting more than this. good thing i work at a video store and saw this for free, because i would'nt spend one dime on this movie. i gave this movie a 2, only because i have seen worse. if i were you i would stay away from this, very far away.

about 5 minutes into the movie you're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there. the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are. this is what 50 year old producers and out-of-touch hollywood script writers think stoner life is like, as if they gave the cast of friends some pot. bland, dull, annoying and completely unrealistic. i despise this movie.

absolutely nothing about this movie is funny, interesting, or relevant. besides two characters getting together at the end, nothing is ever resolved, and there is no plot. and by the way, what is the deal with the cover of the dvd? it has a female ass in daisy duke shorts... where was that scene in the movie? no one ever wore daisy dukes in this film! surprisingly enough, almost all of the acting in this film is good, and jack black plays a full song (could be a tenacious d track... don't know though)... those are the only redeeming values, though. overall, it's just a waste of time.

what a waste of a great cast. figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well-known actors. what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other. characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them. calling it a comedy was a stretch as well...the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black's song, which was basically tenacious d. i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted.

it's hard to believe that with a cast as strong as this one has, that this movie can be such a dud. it's such an incredibly horrible film. how was it ever made? how did so many good actors wind up in such a terrible film? don't waste your life. don't watch even one moment of this film.

there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call "good". the acting was dull and sedated. the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial. characters have no drive, motivation, or reason for us to care about them. there's such a lack of interest and tension that it's hard to follow the banal action and dialog. and the plot... if anyone finds it, i'm sure it would be as boring as everything else.this isn't funny, it's not romantic, it doesn't reflect on the human condition. if you want a good stoner comedy, watch half-baked; if you want a good stoner drama, watch trainspotting. the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the mid-late 90's cast. which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star, but, then again, this is a shallow movie.

it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere, then quickly leads the main characters into a three-ring circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters. i'm a huge collector of stoner movies, but this is something i would not consider a valid addition. bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster, and i wouldn't be caught dead with this on my shelf. i'm actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america. if you're a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards. i really can't say enough bad things about this movie.

if this is the author's and director's idea of a slice of life, they are clinically manic depressives. a sad, moody film at best, with ubiquitously aimless and unhappy characters who negatively interact with disastrous results. this film is billed as a comedy. what was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated arson or the drug induced, forcible rape of one of the main characters. is this art imitating life? jack black was mildly amusing as the mountain man, weed farmer. however, even this segment of the film was rife with pathos. what was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage. if black's character was so paranoid, why was he doing acid with a group of people right out of woodstock? is there no end to disconnected relationships, a plot less script, and scene transitions lacking any cohesiveness or logical chronology.

i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to portland from downer's grove, ill. with two of his high school buds. he seemed like a normal-enough guy, though he had a lot of artistic pretensions. within a few years, he jumped into portland's post-punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others, and a band that definitely wasn't headed anywhere, although it got him a lot of action, including a fling with courtney love in her portland groupie days. he seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to san francisco, then n.y.c.i was surprised to hear that he got a publishing deal in '95 after the band crashed and burned. courtney love's name seemed to be the clincher. i have no idea how the movie came about, especially with this cast, but i doubt that gus van sant was involved. anyway, the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer, or artist or something, but doesn't have anything to say. like kerouac without the benzedrine.

if this is classed as 'real life' of london, then the producers must be on different planet.it is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dingy, dross on tv.everyone is fighting, everything has nasty under tones running through it, nothing is done for genuine reasons.if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk, then this programme is by the farthest from reality.there is not one good word i can say about this programme. the only certainty is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner.even the characters are totally unbelievable!

this soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years, eastenders is the prime example. for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders "mirrors life"? life on which planet, exactly? it's written about "working-class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the "working-class" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders.this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford.thus, it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders.other soaps have followed in ee's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash. the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves. meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new, tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy.and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room. it's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison.

i think this programme is a load of rubbish. all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting?! these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives. also, the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes, i am bored with it. i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show 'tv burp' e.g. the weak joke "the princess and the pea isn't exactly shakespeare is it?" that had sonia and naomi in stitches. i don't see how that is funny. i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv licence so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. isn't there anything better than this?

i don't know how people can watch this - the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die, houses burn down, car crashes, babies die, and cast members being killed off every week. its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings. its so depressing. i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying - 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or 'whose house shall we torch in a months time?'its the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment, and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore

eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now. it's such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings.the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat. the first two out (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the 3rd & 4th out will have a fight in the vic, the 5th one will be arrested, the 6th develop an addiction, 7th get pregnant etc etc.the producers are clever though. the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines.1) someone will walk in the vic & say "what's goin on?" 2) someone else will stand up say "leave it aht" (out) 3) then a woman will say "doan choo come in ere 'n' insult mah fam'ly"that's it. that's every show. apart from the occasional "get it sort-id / is it sort-id?"the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk & their way of life. the buffers came off when 1) they extended it from two nights a week & 2) the slater family turned up. how they attract viewers is beyond me. the kat character symbolizes everything that's gone wrong with society, treating anyone else like something she's pulled off the bottom of her shoe.the people who vote her the best character, in these polls, must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp 'best sportsman' despite the fact he hasn't played a game for 3 years.what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave? ross kemp, martin kemp, the list is endless.how long has the longest couple's marriage lasted, with them being faithful to each other? yes, people leave, but until the script writers realise that characters, couple can be interesting & likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate. an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that. and zoe & the doctor top even lofty & 'shell' as 'most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv.'yes, eastenders is the most watched show, thats undisputed. but many external factors contribute to that. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures, it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of the viewers watch it, out of nothing more than habit, but if they were completely honest to themselves, they would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely pitiful.

i spent three months living in the east end of london in the latter half of 1987, when the show had been on the air for almost two years. it was considered a running joke there.why? because it had an all-white cast. every cast member and extra in the first couple of years was white.the street where i lived was a long one, with over 800 houses, and to the best of my knowledge i was one of only three or four white faces living on that street. we were on the corner of the indian and turkish "quarters", and even if you excluded those two races the asians and afro-caribbeans outnumbered the white people twenty-to-one. plus, of course, of the very few white people who *did* live in the area, the vast majority were scots like me - a "cockney" accent was never heard.that wasn't a racist rant, just a simple statement of fact. the bbc either couldn't be bothered crossing london to do their research before writing this soap, or else they only had white actors available and decided to bluff it out.either way, as i say, in the east end of the time, we considered it a comedy show. :-)

my wife and i watched this abortion from its beginning. i hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of years.for me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features. my wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether. occasionally i catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfing.there is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful. there never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind. that was always my main gripe with it when we first watched it- no humour. the writers seem to have no idea about drama - they seem to think conflict is drama, and of course that is only one element of it. light and shade is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it. i am sure the actors in eastenders are competent but they have nothing to work with. it must be the most depressing acting job in showbiz. i fail to understand why the british public watch it and love it. what on earth does it say about our psyche? i have heard it said that it is "just like real life"-its nothing like my life or anyone's life i know, otherwise we would be flinging ourselves from high buildings or under public transport. the themes it tackles are far from family viewing but still are shown pre-watershed. i love series like breaking bad or the wire but i would not expect to see them at 7.30 or 8.00 in the evening. the programme is trash writ large and should be avoided at all cost.

it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened. the 'square' is peopled by such a miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, spiteful, unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined. everyone is stabbing someone in the back, everyone is attempting to commit adultery, everyone is trying to cheat someone. that, or they are being stabbed, cuckolded or swindled. nobody is cheerful. nobody laughs. nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day. it's hell, with cockney accents.i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the samaritans. it's perfect viewing for the depressed. it doesn't cheer them up; what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad-arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse - they might be living in 'albert square'.apart from the above; as a representation of london's east end, it is pure hokum. the programme-makers have evidently never been across town. the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque. and this pretty-well defines the racial majority of the population. white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road flyover, and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that 'eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly'. ten healthy, smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation. eight of them are dark-skinned... what's more, i used to work with a bunch of anglo-saxon - dare i say 'pukka' - cockneys a few years ago. and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i've never had. each day was like an oswald moseley rally. they couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation. in fact their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixated upon sex-organs and their application. alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison.any programme that purported to represent london's native east-end caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast - even after the 9 o-clock watershed. imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark. but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful.i don't know how such a soap-opera came to be. this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever. and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition, it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic-depressives with cockney accents - what's the point of that?dull, dreary, unrelentingly disillusional, and ethnically preposterous. the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation.avoid it like the plague.

it is fitting that the title character in sydney white is defined from the beginning of the film by her awkwardness because the film, like the character, tends to begin every scene with a well-meant but inappropriate statement, then backtracks inadvertently making it worse and leaving the viewer in total confusion.this scenario gets old quick. now imagine a hour and a half of this, throw on the most predictable storyline imaginable; add some vague snow white and the seven dwarfs references and amanda bynes blinking in wide-eyed puzzlement and you have sydney white...for more of my review http://www.helium.com/items/1433421-sydney-white-review

my 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable tv. as someone who saw revenge of the nerds in a movie theater, i found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it. the nerds were simply replaced by dorks. i drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. the cast was cute, especially amanda bynes.screenwriter chad creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick. the title should have simply been "revenge of the dorks." perhaps the sequel will be revenge of the dorks 2.

i rated this one better than awful because i liked seeing jonathon from buffy in something again -- even if it was the same role.first, the concept is kind of cute for a short, but not an entire movie. the writing was forced and contrived. i have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing.second, amanda bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed -- even when she's not trying to do it. she's just not funny. she always plays some sort of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself -- ironic, considering amanda seems to always be a caricature. i would actually like to see her in something serious. i really want to give her a chance, but she is always cast in these trite roles where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow that's a good thing?finally, the whole "i'm a dork" segment was ripped off from revenge of the nerds. there was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable.shame, shame, shame.

amanda bynes is an enormously talented actress, and i've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "she's the man." for that reason alone, "sydney white" was a huge disappointment for me. the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. in a good fun teen comedy, its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters. in "sydney white," this idea is thrown out the window.amanda bynes makes a fine sydney, but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress. i blame this on the script, which makes her character too bland and restrained, and on the hair/makeup department, which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style. the seven "dorks" that sydney eventually befriends are far worse. they are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. they're essentially repulsive gag fodder. as is the story's "prince charming," who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be.perhaps the film's biggest star-to-be (with the possible exception of amanda bynes) is sara paxton, who's actually very good as the conniving rachel witchburn. it's just a shame that the script-writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black.the plot is basically that of "snow white." what kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re-imagining. the connections to "snow white" are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown. prince charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is far too despicably witchy, the seven "dorks" are too dorky, and sydney is just too pure of heart. now, this is not to say that the movie is all bad. though bynes is forced down by the script, she still has her moments. as does sara paxton, who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes. sydney's room-mate, named "dinky" is also great fun as a character. it's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichéd to recommend.

this gawd-awful piece of tripe is all over the place. the script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. there are a couple of decent actors in it (charles durning, eg.), but the director got nothing out of them. the plot line has santa, feeling dejected and thinking no one needs him any more, taking a little girl across country to try to get her father back together with her mother. it includes a con-man in a santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by "isaac" from the love boat), the world's largest elf (played by bruce vilnach - a very funny man, but no actor), a hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on christmas eve, and a sleigh race where someone cuts one of santa's skis trying to win. if the plot sounds bad, it's worse on the little screen. if you see this movie coming up next, run, do not walk, to your television and unplug it. you may want to boil your television to remove any remaining infection. if you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this, you may have to burn your television, and have the cable company install entirely new lines.

tug-3 is absolutely right. although i am sure that mr. osmond wanted to make a sincere, heartwarming christmas movie, this one is as cynical and creepy as they come. the religious significance of christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute kids, clueless grownups, and dopey villains. the production values demonstrate that this was either filmed on a shoestring or by truly inexperienced filmmakers-- i suspect the latter, unfortunately. the worst part, oddly enough, really is the music. you would think someone with a long-standing musical career could do better than the title song, but you would be wrong. even my mom didn't like this movie, and she likes the osmonds and sappy stuff.

this movie was a low point for both jason robards and sam peckinpah. major plot points are taken directly from sergio leone's masterpiece "once upon a time in the west" (released two years earlier and also featuring robards): a man finds a watering hole is found in the desert, being the only water for many miles in every direction, he plans to build a 'station' around the hole and to ensure there's a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. to this add an intemperate preacher, bad music, silly fast action shots, even sillier t&a shots - and there you go. there is little question why it failed at the box office. the real question is "how did it make it that far?".

ill-tempered, verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit-picking requests, keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year of office-terror, the working stiff finally cracks. writer-director george huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here. his "swimming with sharks" isn't a diatribe against hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hard-working underling...instead, it's stunt film-making with a twist, a one-trick pony with tunnel-vision. the surroundings don't look or feel like tinsel town (perhaps due to a limited budget), and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie-making entity (it could be a realtor's office in the valley, for all we know). lead kevin spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives a controlled and focused performance as the power-mad mogul whose ego is out of control; he does good work, and yet the character doesn't ring true. we learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high-ranking status fail to jibe with what we do see; who does this man answer to? what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport? what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around? the film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated, it begins to seem like a stage-play padded out for the big screen--and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it. perhaps huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his movie looks like a half-baked project which needed a lot more insight, humor, and atmosphere. ** from ****

i tried to like this movie. i love kevin spacey and i knew the other guy from his role as "big brain on" brad in pulp fiction. but i just didn't care about the characters at all. kevin spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, i didn't like him. especially the ending---that made me hate him even more. this was like watching a bad car wreck. spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, i don't recommend it.

ugly, heartless hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. the scenes without spacey reveal how truly awful the film really is. but the scenes with spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end. yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. if you want to see a great film about the evils of modern hollywood, check out robert altman's "the player". this sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league.

yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. this is the worst film i've seen in quite some time. i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and spacey's performance in particular.some will chastise me for saying it, but i find kevin spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. i felt like i was watching a meaner version of kevin's "american beauty" role. his character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant.there are all-world trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low. somehow, i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately 20 minutes into the film).what about the faux-homage to "resevoir dogs"? whaley proclaims, "i think i saw this in a movie once," as if he's going to cut off spacey's ear. but what does he use to cut him? an envelope! that's right, he's going to give him paper cuts! that has to be one of hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling.i will admit that i didn't see the end of this film (my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. well, i don't care what happened in the end, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did.

there's something wonderful about a "revenge" film. everyone wakes up in the morning believing he/she is the star of "the movie," and that anyone who interferes with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy. revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. rather than fighting back in the moment, the "hero" draws upon built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium. quite naturally, in the "real world" this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie; after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences. a good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. in the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved."swimming with sharks" is advertised as a comedy, no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity. it's dark, but it isn't dark comedy ("company of men" and the works of todd solondz come much closer). parts of the film are so brutal they pre-date the current "torture-porn" genre everyone is so obsessed with ("saw", "hostel"). there are some laughs. there are laughs in "saving private ryan" too, but it isn't labeled comedy.the intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case. it is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to "pay him back" for all the mistreatment. the hero (aptly named "guy") is an "everyman" so vague we know literally nothing about him...what does he do with his spare time? does he have friends/family? how did he get where he is? what are his interests (this becomes a running motif through the film, no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle..."what do you want?", the answer to which we are denied by a vague, cheat of an ending)? it's very difficult to care for such a character, even if acted well (even tom hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll, such as "punchline"). kevin spacey as the boss, "buddy," is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor. the best laughs came when he abused his assistant--he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what guy will endure. when kevin's character is being tortured, the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him. guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality. at this point any message the author had has been lost; there's no "hero" in this film, ergo, no reason to care at all.it's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. i worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far-fetched. i had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that i was justified. i thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the only woman--there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film) just by being your eager, naive self, that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person. time and tide have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self. as the film points out, if guy was so unhappy he only had to leave. the film doesn't offer any denouement at all, "surprise" ending notwithstanding. we still know nothing about the protagonists, we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too. in short, there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) the film business can be pretty brutal.there are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies, both the feel-good variety ("9-to5," "working girl," "the devil wears prada") and not so much ("war of the roses", the remake of "the hills have eyes"). this isn't one of them--despite a fun turn by benicio del toro in the emily blunt role from "prada" and some interesting work by spacey and michelle forbes, this is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has, one hopes, "worked it all out" by now...

talk about false advertising! what was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place? i think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie. i can appreciate black comedy, but this had only the blackness without any comedy. the movie was generally disturbing and un-funny. yes, kevin spacey was good as buddy and the rest of the cast was also good, but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for guy (whaley) to lose his mind so badly. the ending was disappointing as well. what would buddy's motivation be for letting guy get away with what he did? this isn't really explained at all. why would buddy go for such a plan? wouldn't it be more like buddy to screw guy completely by turning him over to the police? the ending didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how i looked at it.generally, i disliked the film despite the good acting. spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film, but towards the end he gives buddy a bit of needed humanity. the story just wasn't as good as the cast.

the role of buddy ackerman is no stretch for kevin spacey. he's played version of that character many times other, better films. this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce. the script leaves little time for plot or character development, resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the "good stuff". the difference is that here the "good stuff" isn't people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain, making it appropriate viewing for young adults.of course there's nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex, and i guess there's nothing wrong with "swimming with sharks" if you want to watch people undergoing physical, emotional, and psychological torture. but if you're looking for incisive satire, interesting characters, or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions, you should probably look elsewhere.

i was recommended this movie by one of my film-making friends, and was therefore expecting something good. sadly, i was very disappointed by the first half -- ah, a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their a**hole boss, how original -- and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45-odd minutes i'd already wasted. but all i got was the 'shock' ending...the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say, and says whatever it does say (hard to tell what that is) badly. great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i can't care about.now maybe if i didn't moonlight in the movie industry i'd be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen, but as it is my feelings are as summed up above: 'ho hum'.2/10... would have been 1/10 if it weren't for the acting and the paper cut scene.

why is guy working for buddy? probably because ari was not around in 1995. why does dawn want to be with guy? for access to buddy. why does she stay with guy? i am not sure.there are bunch of things about this movie that i am not sure about. but, kevin spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.frank whaley's guy is certainly out of his element working for buddy  he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting equal instead of sweet & low. michelle forbes' dawn, who also wants to make meaningful movies, seems way out of guy's league.the ending leaves a lot to be desired.

this show is awesome and we have been enjoying it thoroughly. set in alaska, i don't agree with the homosexual content on tonight's show. i feel that you are pushing too hard to bring new york to alaska. its one thing to have a new yorker struggling in the alaska wild, but to try to turn the alaska town into new york? this is a nice show about dainty women and true alaska men and to bring a same sex couple into the mix is throwing the balance way off. alaska should be portrayed as a man and new york as the woman. i think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all are doing. can't we have a nice show without the imbalance of nature.

i am a huge fan of northern exposure. men in trees is a complete knock-off of northern exposure. there's the city-folk from new york stuck in a remote backwoods town (marin frist / joel fleishman). she immediately doesn't hit it off with a local (jack slattery / maggie o'connell). the town only has one pilot who is not often available. ther is only one radio show. and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships. too many parallels. just like northern exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character. i'm bored. give me something new to think about.on the upside, the writing is pretty good. but if this was a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism. perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of joshua brand and john falsey.

on one thursday evening at 10:00pm, my local west coast abc affiliate aired the pilot episode of "northern exposure". the abc network usually airs "men in trees" in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting event.despite both shows are set in alaska and filmed on location in the pacific northwest (exposure in washington state, trees in vancouver, bc), re-watching "northern exposure" (as well as few episodes of "sex and the city") reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid "men in trees". anne heche can be a good actress with the right material. unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in alaska grates on my nerves. perhaps because i feel that heche is miscast, i am not convinced of her "fish-out-of-water" character.i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes. the hot-looking local, the kindly bar owner, the bush pilot, the local police officers, the dim but well-intentioned radio dj, etc.the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran "er" actor abraham benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women. considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james mangold, (his movies "heavy" and "cop land" had lead characters who were large men) then i am not surprised why benrubi was cast in a non-typical role.nonetheless, i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love "men in trees". it fits the quirky niche for television audiences. i wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows.

not too long ago i bought a cheap vhs tape entitled "just rambling along" supposedly featuring laurel and hardy. being somewhat familiar with their output and not recognizing this title, i made the agonizing decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it. upon playing it, i identified the film as hop to it. of course, mr. laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. even worse, the quality is terrible. it looks like it was duped from an 8mm film source. it did have a somewhat appropriate musical score. actually, in all seriousness, the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like. in my opinion, it is a decent but unexceptional short. imdb should add just rambling along as an alternate title for this film, which incidentally was the name of a 1918 stan laurel film!

this is definitely a "lesser known" comedy short from the 1920s. the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by kino films featuring non-laurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie. they are interesting and historically important, but also generally average to below average for the style film. compared to shorts by chaplin, keaton, arbuckle and lloyd, they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor. also, the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds. i ended up turning off the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood. but, despite this, they are still worth seeing.i've gotta be honest about this short. it was the last of 8 on this dvd and by the time i got to it, i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts. so, it is possible the film might be a little better than a 4--but certainly, if this is the case, no better than a 5! the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy. nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there.

ladies and gentlemen, may we present the worst of all disney remakes. although the name of this movie is "that darn cat", it should have been "that darn teen" or "fbi agent". the cat didn't get any real good scenes, ricci's character was more annoying than funny, doug e. doug didn't get any good lines, even dean jones's cameo role couldn't save this movie! the only really good characters were the town's only two auto mechanics, but their scenes were only brief. in all, i'd say that if you are considering watching this movie, go get something more intelligent like a barney video.

it's as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time. this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film, which is obviously far superior to this trash. it's clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be mano a mano, man against man, instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes. at this point in the film, the characters just don't act like regular people and not even like their own personalities. it makes little sense. it's quite clear why this film flopped. it's just not believable at all and that's too bad - it started out with promise. don't be fooled.

"tank girl" was, i suppose, meant to be the "buckaroo banzai" of the 90's and was marketed as such. the comparison is, admittedly, appropriate; both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that, as impossible as the story is to sort out, it certainly isn't boring."tank girl" is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts. otherwise you'll end up with a skull-cracking headache like me.

ok so it's not great either, but only because of how great laurel and hardy have been in the past. if this film received a total overhaul, with picture quality enhanced, add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape. as it is, it does have it's problems. people do slate it for how old the boys look. quel surprise! they were in their 60's and had led a 'life'. however, to me, they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm, and while this doesn't even come close to tickling the feet of their classics( i gave it a 4), it's worth a watch simply because it's them. to think otherwise would be impostorous!!

released at a time when duvivier was going again from strength to strength ."black jack" which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary "au royaume des cieux" and the dazzling stunning "sous le ciel de paris" , is a jumble,which duvivier himself hated,which is not surprising.there's almost nothing to write about this dud.we can notice that: 1.orson welles used to admire duvivier .that may explain why wellesian actors were featured in duvivier's movies :joseph cotten in "lydia" (1941) ,and here a totally wasted agnes moorehead .it's the first timei have not enjoyed moorehead's performance!on the other hand,welles borrowed his desdemona (suzanne cloutier) from duvivier's "au royaume des cieux" for his "othello".2.in any duvivier's movie,there's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short while);then the chase when dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.duvivier's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.as for the rest ,as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes,it's a black joke.

this is not a movie. this is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, dubbed over with some random text. the footage is not that great and the text is not that great either. the end product is excruciatingly dull.on the dvd, turning the commentary on can provide some entertainment value, as the director makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci-fi movie. it's also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage. too bad it's rubbish. but i think "the making of fata morgana" would be a fascinating film, sort-of like 'ed wood" was.

i find herzog's documentary work to be very uneven. fata morgana, a companion piece of sorts to lessons of darkness, lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author. it is by comparison amateur looking, aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any german tourist equipped with a handycam, the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images, wire fences, derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order, intercut with shots of sand dunes. at one point herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand, yet the image is presented much like you and me would, perhaps worse, the camera peering hand-held from one cattle to the next. for a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast, a hypnotic, surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes, it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. it's all over the place, half-hearted and tedious, mayan creation myths recited in voice-over, then some other text herzog fancied for literature. it's not until near the end that fata morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. first with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic, both of them apathetic in their task. a man holding up a turtle. a group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. other than that, this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.

"people stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before. during a dinner discussion of the incident, the lights go out and, when they come back on, they discover that one of the guests has been killed. fearing for their lives, the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.there are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the "old dark house" story, with the "play within a play" being its most interesting feature. however, the direction is rather ordinary, which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production. like most movies of this type, there is (or, should be) an ensemble of intriguing characters. herein, only old-time broadway producer richard carle (as herman wood) and his fey secretary johnny arthur (as homer erskine) maintain interest.**** the ghost walks (12/1/34) frank r. strayer ~ richard carle, johnny arthur, john miljan

of all of the post-1985 perry mason movies i have seen, this one is my least favorite.i confess i have never liked diana muldaur as an actress. she only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with. this one is no exception - it runs true to form.the only thing that saves this movie, in my opinion, is an earnest performance by scott baio as the prosecutor - i actually found myself rooting for him to win, and the movie is worth seeing for him alone.

despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of "who did it", which has characterised all the perry mason movies so far, the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood. of course, in general, the perry mason movies are not significant, but, even for their low standards, this one is weak.

this movie was recommended to me by some academics. from their comments, i had some pretty lofty expectations. but this movie was nothing but disappointing. the aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the bush doctrine. but the director fails miserably at this. also i seriously question the director's choice of main character. it's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard. the rise of corporation power, so what? most importantly, this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power; it's clearly intended for those who've already formed their opinions. it's true that the movie's aesthetics are quite pleasing. but pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks.

i have read all of shakespeare's plays, seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some. i do not necessarily believe that shakespeare must be done in the "traditional" fashion, but i hated this movie.there is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary. there is grotesqueness that is far beyond what i believe shakespeare intended. some of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and there are those elements, like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie, but replace shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences.i am sorry to say that i wasted perfectly good money to buy the dvd of this movie.

this was an interesting adaption of william shakespeare's last known solo play but in my humble opinion, a terrible one. jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start. he makes miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long, prospero is no different - a mix of madness and self-pity on his part. i could not imagine shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way jarman portraits them.caliban's appearance is maybe the only thing he got right, but then again, i was under the impression that caliban was a tormented, deformed monster but turns out to be an insane rambling, northerner who is constantly cackling, not as i would have imagined him. ferdinand makes a brief appearance, naked most the time and quiet.in fact, to the point i stopped watching this awful adaption, their had been so many lines cut from the play. if anything, i think jarman was trying to re-write shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time. so much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a shakespeare play, but a load of 70's melodramatic, preposterous rubbish.an attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end, but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be.

i was loaned this dvd by the director of a film i am working with, in which i play an actor who is playing prospero. knowing his own style, i did not expect anything resembling a "classical" interpretation of the text.what i have found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and tedious. like most experimental music, i find that in films such as this, the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.thus we have a caliban who is more a clown than a threat, and who not even miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd, since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once). a stefano and trinculo who are more annoying than funny. an oddly young prospero who looks like amadeus. and a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.interestingly enough, i do not have an issue with the way in which ferdanand or miranda are portrayed. his stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.i do not say that this is a bad film, but an experimental one. one that takes huge risks, but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the tempest for its own sake.

derek jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit. he is a painter, and paint he does. his films are almost always visually splendid, but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry. watch his movies in fast forward, the really fast setting that you can only get on dvd. in the tempest, jarman does very little with the script or the characters, using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. he even goes so far as to contradict shakespeare's original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes. there is none of the romance, magic, trickery, or urgency the script calls for, little spontaneity, and the character of caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts, similar to gaveston in jarman's edward ii. it is too bad that this is just about the only film version of the tempest available.

at first i thought 'nasaan ka man' might be one of those progressive new filipino films. as someone noted earlier, the movie does not look poorly made. it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, good-looking actors, and nicer locations.however, the improvements are all purely superficial. if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel just like your typical, second-rate local movie - - hyperactive drama, predictable plot twists, "yeah right!" moments, crying, screaming, and characters you could care less about, all shoved down your throat.a couple of things annoyed me about this movie. first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that not-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. second, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic, but i was simply forced to turn up the brightness feature on my tv set.

this is one of four 1970s movies by tv writer lane slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. they feature likable tv personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars, including light-touch love interests. the others are: they only kill their masters (james garner, 1972); and the girl in the empty grave and deadly game (both andy griffith, 1977).alda's is set near vermont ("mount angel" next to "horse creek"); the others in california, garner's at seaside ("eden landing") and griffith's in the mountains ("jasper lake"). all try to capture the feel of a small town, to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters, and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. on that level, they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal). but they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue, slack pacing, bland settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and off-putting, forced attempts (often juvenile or crude) at color or humor.alda's and garner's are the most serious about story, characters, pacing, and tone. they have the best supporting casts, though alda's is put to better use; the griffith casts pale in comparison. alda's has the best director."shocking" has some surprise and drama. the killer's method is inventive. the tone is more even, and the dialogue more natural, than in griffith's. alda's film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey, exaggerated local characters, both of which come across as figments of a hollywood scriptwriter, not as genuine (the worst offender is the griffith movies' pipsqueak, mumbling moron "whit," who, we are told, tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch, dragged away the dock for the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them, and filled out $11 on the withdrawal slip of "spiro t. babylis" only to be discovered by the teller). mercifully absent is the clunky, heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the griffith movies ("you going to lunch?" "i'm going to take out the boat." "you going to take the boat to lunch?" "i'm not going to lunch." "you're not going to take the boat to lunch?"; "there aren't any fish in this lake. why are you fishing here?" "it's illegal in horse mountain." "it's posted here too, you're breaking the law." "some law. there aren't any fish in this lake." "then why are you fishing here?" "i told you, it's illegal in horse mountain."; "please call me lloyd. my name is lloyd." "okay, lloyd..." "call me lloyd. that's my name. my name is lloyd.")but alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief, certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town. slate has the character admit as much, when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue, as a result of an accidental name recognition. rather than detect or investigate, barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial. his secretary lasser feeds him a key clue ("why didn't i think of that," he says!). an embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot contrivance, leads to another gift clue.worse, barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (deadly game also suggests slate has something against the military) than leading them or his own men effectively. he allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target. barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene, without drawing his gun or trying to take control. again, he is ineffective, and nearly killed, in the climactic scene, which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected, by accident. the erratic northeastern accent that alda affects does not help believability.there are plot holes. why would the killer strike after all these years? and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. but they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together, a shopkeeper in his store during business hours, a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and, unbelievably, his dog!alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies. barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. he then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids. this, and talk about the female doctor, smack of a crude, mean-spirited pattern (garner's film has been described as "sleazy," including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her. griffith's feature an ersatz ropers routine, in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into "the supply closet"; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death ("did you take her out?" "i took her in once."); a reference to bank teller "bernice" as "swollen-up in places" and to "sticking a pin in" her and to "hating" and firing secretary "maude" because she was "too hairy"; a description of the female doctor's practice as "two stirrup tables and a flashlight"; a humiliating scene in which fran ryan propositions griffith, offering "some home grown"; and an insulting subplot in which a woman, pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon, seems to "sleep around").finally, alda's film has a grim, bleached-out, colorless, lifeless look and feel. only louise lasser adds spark. at least the other films had some spirit, scenery, and pleasant music; griffith's got out onto the mountainside, onto the lake, and even out into the big city. you feel more like re-watching masters or empty grave than shocking.

it's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and i agree.if mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be queen and princess of the universe, not kicking around in some little town.i've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts i flip the channel.i watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed (for the better i'd hoped) but nope, same old "we're so clever with our references to pop culture" that i nearly barfed.long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops.

i decided to watch this show and give it a go but i found it to be boring, and more importantly dull.....dull.there is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all dull, there is far too much talking and the character lorelai...just keeps talking on and on and on.... during a second glance felt like suffocating the characters, the banter doesn't work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what is already a crap show....i can't believe this show survived past the pilot.... this seems to be a show which forces the 'listen to your parents' line....no actual drama exists....should have stayed a pilot.....and a pilot alone...

when i first watch this series, the impression i got was that the characters were charming and funny, lorelai and rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative. after watching it for some time, however, my opinion changed.the main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self-centered self-obsessed narcissists, who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence. for example, rory wouldn't speak to her mother for months when lorelai didn't consult her on her impulsive marriage, while lorelai dumped luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances. these people are shallow, see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules, and if they don't, they will hold grudges against them for an eternity. they don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence. most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown-up way. they think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned.the series is character-based, so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch. i still have the rest of the series, but i doubt if i will ever finish watching them. i will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion - they must just as horrid as lorelai et al.

i tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program "gilmore girls". it baffled me for i just couldn't put my finger on what this was about. was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? what the heck is this show about? finally, i just didn't care. the cast makes me want to scream. the writing is neither "smart" or "intelligent" it's syrupy and tedious.so why did i watch? because i heard so many good things about this and i am not one to voice an opinion until i have watched. knee-jerk reactions are usually wrong, so i watched a few times. the first time i watched this, i saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. maybe that is what didn't attract me. i never liked any of the "freaky friday" films - not to say this is like that, but there are some similarities. also i have a friend who watches this show every week. so i asked her, "what is this show about?" a very bright young lady, usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. so i asked others who rave about it - they really don't know either.gilmore girls is turning out to be a tv program that's like an "art house movie". many of us wont get it, but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one, just to be "hip." yes, i find lauren graham's lorelai annoying - whine, whine, nasally whine. a whole hour of that. wow. and the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. the town is hokey, the men are wimps, the grand parents are boring, and sadly i find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do. it's like watching paint dry on the wall.

usually when i don't see a show on an original run, i find it later on cable and realize it's a gem. the "gimore girls" is one of those rare exceptions. i'm glad i missed it.i truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling, stupid, boring banter. this is one hour of just that. the mother, lorelei, made me wonder if she is bipolar and off her lithium. she never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to every person she interacted with. worse yet, her speech is childish and soooo, like, valley girl. she talked about guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. like, what's the sitch?? (for situation). i've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series. it's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the "girls" from planet mars. the males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable. if lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation, i'd have to mace her to get rid of her. she obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. she also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others.in one show lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm. she got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction. she goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. she dithers on about how boring the guy was. her date somehow got a few words in edgewise. lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (choke). hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was.one other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality. lorelei even dresses like her kid. this obviously 40-something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow.i thought that this show should have been followed by "just shoot me," because that's exactly how i felt.

this is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show. people say its witty and intelligence? i don't see how? maybe because the characters use fancy words? maybe because they are snooty, use dry humor, and have 2 dimensional personalities. i went to an ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters. in fact had i met someone like them i would have likely strangled them! the men act like little emotional pre-teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes... the characters are no at all authentic. simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated. this show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain-dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis.

the preposterous premise of this flick has to do with argentina reclaiming the falkland islands, having failed through force in 1982, by impregnating the european women inhabitants with argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored argentina. yeah, right. the reconnaissance is done by our hero/villan and cad, fabian, who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman, camilla. an unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary, this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip....yada, yada, yada. the film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as fabian and camilla wend their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed. "f*ckland" is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak, no frills, jigglecam austerity of dogme indies.

i will confess that once i started watching this movie, it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion. quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim, or maybe fascination that they got funding to make, distribute, and show this film that kept me searching it for merit, or possibly some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain. but no such luck.so you are warned to not start watching it in the first place, lest the same thing happen to you. there's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on.the first-person mockumentary and the schtick about fabian's "quest" to impregnate women of the falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric (maybe freshman - high school freshman, that is) film student project than you might imagine. the effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants (who, other than the two professional leads, are in fact real people) as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics (no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically, it's pointless and sexist).the reason i ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab, there's an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until it's completely off, even when you know it's bad for you. you just want to see what happens.in the end, this is rather dishonest filmmaking, because it seems ultimately to have no moral center, no elucidation of the local political situation, nor any place in the type of political-sexual-personal film universe a la goddard. in short it's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does. smug would be the one-word tagline.i'd suggest the filmmakers rent 'waiting for guffman' a few times, or hell, even 'blair witch project' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion. or at least entertainment value.

i watched "fuckland" a long time ago. i lied if i'd tell that i remember it in detail; what i remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's.supposedly, "fuckland" is a critic of argentinians, presenting us (i'm an argentinian too) as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty, ridiculous victories, and think we're the best thing that god (who is also an argentinian) created. i'm not going to argue that. it's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part i despise, by the way). and even if this weren't true, that's not my point. the worst sin "fuckland" committed was to express such a statement about its own director.the continuous impression i received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie. many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. the director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones. and there's no plot at all.moreover, this movie proudly presents a dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?).i found the movie offensive, not as an argentinian, but as a watcher. i felt underestimated. "fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

now and again, a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity. we just finished studying the novel, "northanger abbey", at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the bbc adaptation.the funny thing about northanger abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. the film is nothing like the book, for example, the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes. john thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while isabella plays the role of slut. catherine, the main character, is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god's earth (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketballs) whilst mr tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double. the plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film, i don't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all, a 7 year old black kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her. yes, that's right, cartwheeling. nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by catherines "fantasies" in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.northanger abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that, bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone. northanger is a barely laughably bad film. don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell.

awful, dreadful, terrible. the actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic. i rented the dvd and had to force myself to watch it until the end.my advice: read the book, it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams catherine has.i think i have never watched such a bad movie.

i've seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day, but this one tops them all! the bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story, which is, in itself, untrue to the book. mr. tilney is nothing like handsome; as for catherine morland, a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience. isabella is nothing like the aphrodite one reads about in the original text, and james morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story. also, as others have pointed out before, this novel was intended to satirize the gothic craze prevalent in austen's time, but it appears that this "soft horror" film was designed and meant to be taken seriously. i'm sure jane austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke.

we really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie. but we'll start with the plot. we sincerely suspect that whomever wrote/produced/directed this movie never read the book. because they missed the entire point. satirical, not horror. just a hint. second, the bath scene. enough said. third, the added characters. the sketchy gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling. we don't understand where this came from either. and then there was the casting. all of them were really unlikeable. we were very upset that catherine and mr. tilney ended up together, because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy. and...the music. we think that the bbc producers ran out of money, so raided their grandmother's attic. and they found some old records. saxophone, wailing female voices, and an occasional electric guitar. *shudder*plus, the best line ever: "since you left, the white rose bush has died of grief." if anybody has any explanation, we would love to hear it. because it makes absolutely no sense.we are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public. we think it should be considered a federal offense. torture is illegal.this movie is by far the worst we have seen to date. and i've seen a lot of movies.our recommendation: give this movie to whomever you hate. they will watch it, and want to kill themselves. and we agree with a previous post, we would give this 0 stars, if at all possible. do not watch!! and we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production. or were mentally insane. these are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review.

it is hard for a lover of the novel northanger abbey to sit through this bbc adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the tv screen-in fact, if jane austen herself were to see this, she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out. maggie wadey's adaptation has made northanger abbey into what it satirized, the gothic novel (and the readers of gothic novels).the role of catherine morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to austen's catherine, a open-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. but the henry tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking, cane-wielding, sappy-line-making hero of a gothic novel-he is a tease, a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living (that's right, henry tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely dropped from the script). some of the best scenes from novel, when henry, completely deadpan, outrageously teases the literally-minded catherine on diction, journals, mrs. radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. a large section of henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. besides, peter firth's appearance is not accurate-henry tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond.there are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the marchioness, and what is she doing in the story?! why is john thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? why is northanger abbey a castle? catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that northanger abbey is actually a comfortable, modern house-another element of satire! why portray general tilney as a drunk? why does catherine have those strange visions of mrs. allen threading her finger, etc.? catherine's imagination only runs away with her at northanger, with henry there to correct her gently. and lastly, why are so many facts concerning the tilney family and mrs. tilney's death altered unnecessarily? to make the story more `horrible?' all of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked. >

developing movies that are based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. you have to mainly reconcile reported testimonies, conflicting info sources, and hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can get into. unfortunately, for sasquatch, none of these things seem to take place.the movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the cascades via airplane. from there the research team disappears, and despite attempts from law enforcement officials and local rescue parties they remain missing for some time. while one of the passengers is walking, infra-red-like images are splashed on the screen (a la predator) which subtly hint that the legendary sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fates.cue harlan knowles (henriksen), ceo of biocomp industries and father of one of the crash victims. knowles puts together his own search & rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research crew, along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash.after knowles' tailor-made rescue team is put together, the entire movie traverses down the path of uncolorful characters, dizzying cinematography, and a totally unoriginal plot line. i literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to frighten me out of my wits. the only member of the cast that held his own was henriksen, which doesn't make up for the lack of depth presented in all of the other characters. the over-done sound effects were annoying as well; basically, i didn't know if i was watching a movie about bigfoot or grizzly bears.neither was the plot line all that great. it was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subjected to typical fright music found in anything similar of the genre. obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie, or who'd be the first unlucky soul to get mauled by mr. sasquatch. as far as good points, there are none, and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10.

harlan knowles (lance henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (erica durance). what they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (taras kostyuk) and it's still out there... waiting for them.it was a late night when i poped this into my dvd player. i seriously wish i could go back in time and stop me. most people will tell you that films like "house of the dead" or "s.i.c.k: serial insain clown killers" will be the movies you wish you've never seen. wrong. this will be.i've seen a lot of crap, but this is the only crap that's haunted me. how i wish i never watched this! the acting actually isn't so bad. it's just the writing and the directing and the pacing and everything! i am actually a fan of sasquatch films. but not this one.please, listen to my warning. don't watch this!

(r#64)unredeemable, merit-less, and above all dreary trash. you know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is lance henriksen. the french title for this movie says it all: "inexplicable". how can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age? whatever jonas quastel's trick is, it worked. this is über-trash, i'm talking 'manos'-level crap, meaningless, unwatchable, not-even-so-bad-it's-good, cinematic bile of the highest order.lance henriksen is harlan knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality. he, along with a bunch of morons, goes on a field trip to search for an evil sasquatch which is believed to have attacked a plane which crashed out in the woods, or something. not much else happens. there's some soft-core (meaning: teletubbie level) nudity and some blatant rip-offs of "predator". after 92 minutes of utter pain and another ripped off scene, this time from "blair witch", the movie finally staggers across the finish line and ends. as a bonus, we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie.there's really not much to say about this film. all you need to know is, this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a "so-bad-it's-good" flick. "the untold" is to entertainment value what orlando bloom is to character acting. avoid it like arsenic.

lance used to get quality support work from james cameron. heck, he even had his own tv show (millenium) for a coupl'a seasons. why is he doing this? couldn't he find some better way to pay his bills?i love a good low-budget movie. some of them you can laugh at simply due to their ludicrous premise, their textbook stereotyped characters, or often times because the actors are related to the director/producers. but, this movie has no redeeming value. i didn't laugh. i didn't cry. i only had this sick feeling in my stomach. that feeling was quickly identified as pity. at one point, lance henriksen was an a-list support actor. he's been in terminator (he was going to be terminator before arnold showed up), aliens, aliensiii, classic b-movie pumpkinhead, among so many others! i wanted to send him money after this. maybe we should start a support lance fund or something.then again, for making this thing...maybe not.

a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the ceo's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest. when the search and rescue mission is called off, the ceo, harlan knowles (lance henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? oy, what a mess this film was! it was a shame, because for one, it stars lance henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. it suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director jonas quastel's fault--this film (which i'll be calling by its aka of sasquatch) has just about the worst editing i've ever seen next to alone in the dark (2005), and quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, "okay, let's try that again, but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible".the potential was there. despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator (1987)), ed wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. the monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. the monster's "lair" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers (2001). if it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective.but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made: for some reason, quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a, then a few lines of scene b, then back to a, back to b, and so on.for some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.for some reason, he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. he just cuts to them at random. for that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random. important events either never or barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes.for some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and "humanity" could have easily been shown in another way).for some reason, there is a whole character--mary mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous.for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.for some reason, characters keep calling harlan knowles "mr. h", like they're stereotypes of asian domestics.for some reason, quastel insists on using the "blurry cam" and "distorto-cam" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.i could go on, but you get the idea.i really wanted to like this film better than i didi'm a henriksen fan, i'm intrigued by the subject, i loved the setting, i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but i just couldn't. every time i thought it was "going to be better from this point until the end", quastel made some other awful move. in the end, my score was a 3 out of 10.

there's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time. i've seen "pumping iron ii", "aces: iron eagle iii", "raven hawk", and even the tv movie "getting physical", which featured some big names in the sport. they were tolerable in their own ways (mostly, because they featured rachel mclish. rowwr!!).then i went and watched "nemesis iii: prey harder", on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as sue price, debbie muggli, sharon bruneau and ursula sarcev. love the ladies, always will, but after this i'm kinda glad i missed the first two "nemesis" flicks.well, the first one, anyway. most of the footage here is lifted bodily (and kicking and screaming, i would guess) from "nemesis ii". actually, that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here.but even though price and company flex and pose, they don't get much of a chance to do anything else (like, say, act!). in fact, this whole film is an exercise (get it? ha-ha...) in oblique story-telling, ambiguous characters and open-ended movie-making (in terms of filming as well as the story-line). nothing makes much sense but even if it did, there would still be issues - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women as these. what a crime.of course, it was written and directed by albert pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion?one star only, in consideration for all the hard work that price, muggli, bruneau and sarcev obviously put into their bodies, not the "craft" work done within the movie itself.thanks, ladies.

nemesis 3 is the worst movie what i have ever seen!!! i think that nemesis 3 was only 30 minutes long. and that movie was so boo-oo-ring. when that movie ends and i saw word: nemesis 4... i thought i will...not watch that movie never again.

perhaps the worst of the "nemesis" films (and that says a lot!), this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you've seen them both, even if you've only endured this entry. making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value. in other words, they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake.

i got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because i remembered seeing the first of the series when i was a kid. i'd rented the second one and it was a decent "b" sci-fi. this one was out right obnoxious. the "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. the two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that i literally cringed every time they came on the screen. the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. i don't know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but i'm sure that they'd have done better to have left it at 2 movies. the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. i only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device.

this is going to be my first review on imdb and i'm glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i don't have to change anything...first there are awful movies. movies you can make a laughter out of, like island city, battlefield earth or conan the destroyer. that is totally acceptable. they makes a great party enhancer. then there are the worst movie ever. i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was.i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like sci-fi, terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff like that. everything on the box art was very promising. then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was... what? there was maybe 10 minutes (or more) of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that makes you puke. and it just continues over and over. then some "acting" kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world, where this abomination of mankind actually exists... and then i realized, there are actually two prequels. i didn't think about it first, but the title says "3" in it... and i was horrified. but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end, i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe... but then a little text showed up saying... "next..." and... nemesis 4?!?!?! no please no!!!!!!!!

i really wanted to like this film. the second film in the series had this silly, drive in movie feel to it that was fun (of course, i was also drunk). i watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity, a-la- mystery science theater 3000. i was wrong!!!!! this movie is a god awful waste of film, and i liked the second one!!!! from the effeminate villain with the david bowie fright wig, to the tacky, obnoxious female villains with laughs that could strip the paint off a garage door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. i actually felt bad for sue price, because the material was beneath an actress of her stature (that pretty much says it all). an awful, awful film (that's not a recommendation).

robert downey jr. in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder, but i couldn't believe a great actor like sam neill actually took a part in this movie. the whole thing was unbelievable. i especially like merivel's "cure" for the crazies. they dance...and hey presto! everyone's happy and they're all better! i guess i just didn't like the character merivel too much. therefore, watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon into a great physician was grueling. also, i'm not entirely sure, but i didn't think the plague as well as the famous fire of london took place simultaneously.

mainly a biography of a lustful doctor, "robert merivel ," (robert downey) who has his way in the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half, mainly "katharine" (meg ryan).the good - fantastic set decoration (i.e. the lush king's palace) and costuming make this a visual treat. the language is also very tame. ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting support.the bad - after 50-60 minutes, this movie simply gets too boring. it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite: it drags on and on. the script certainly needed some badly-needed "restoration," shall we say? the film may look nice but it's a long two hours to sit through.....too long.

i have always liked bill murray in films like lost in translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. basically murray plays jack corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. he finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! the only way that jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. also starring pat hingle as vernon. there are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck's front bending forward, and murray screaming, but overall, it's pointless. pretty poor!

this *should* have been an amazingly funny movie...but it falls flat on its face. (in fact, i stopped watching it halfway through, which is something i rarely do...) -- bill murray plays jack corcoran, a second-rate motivational speaker who is bequeathed an elephant by his father (whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born) ; he then has one week to get the ponderous pachyderm across the country. his adventures on the way are only mildly amusing at best. janeane garofalo's considerable comedic talents go largely untapped. anita gillette is impressive in her small role as jack's mother (who has a lot of explaining to do), and pat hingle stands out as a former circus associate of jack's father. -- perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first, but i find that hard to believe...

how can this movie be described? oh yeah i've got it wretched!!!i'm not big on chop socky, but this is just plain garbage. anyone who would waste their money to pay to see it, is just too sad for words.

hello all--for what it's worth, i'm in a doctoral program on indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a year's fieldwork, most of it in jakarta.i'm a big movie fan generally, so i went out as often as i could, and bought tons of local vcds while i was there. this one i saw in the theater, since it opened while i was there, and, thankfully, closed soon after. who was the intended audience for this film? the spoiled wives and daughters of the indonesian super-elite whose antics are weakly and ineffectively parodied? the vast majority of indonesians who could never afford even a single dish, let alone a full meal, in the film's central restaurant location? or gay indonesian males, whose dilemma in the country's muslim-dominated society is reduced to absurdly simplistic, how-to-respect-yourself preaching. if all this wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so ineptly that even native-speaking indonesians couldn't hear many of the lines.in brief, if you're looking for a cutting-edge gay-themed film from a region of the world that seems among the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. "westler" from the early '80s, or "my beautiful laundrette," from the same era, succeed far better in putting a happier face on dealing with homophobia, and do so by showing not telling through incessant, wordy scenes. overall, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can't educate all of its children nor keep them healthy.

am i the only one to think that this is a bad movie?i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects. but the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful.miserable story: the idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny, but what the writer made out of it is stupid.bad acting: the actors move like marionettes. they play and look like people, who really try hard but completely fail to act.bad fx: especially the explosion of the van looks unspeakably cheap.it is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff.

so umm this woman has a vagina that sucks people into it when they umm do it and there's this dude who like follows her around...everywhere....and uhh is umm in love with her and she cant love him back because of her thingy. well her thingy starts talking to her...sort of...it just says feed me over and over and she tries to feed it hot dogs but that doesn't work because it ummmmm wants fresh meat?!?!!? so this woman heads to the red light district where she picks up tourists but only the really sleazy ones cause i guess they deserve it and after a while this dude comes looking for her and even though shes like right there he doesn't see her so eventually he gets involved with conjoined twins but he only likes one of them cause the other is a real hussy. this isn't bad good like i thought it would be cause like the novelty sort of wears off within the first 1/2 hour and it goes on for another hour. i think it killed off a few brain cells cause i sat through this whole thing and now im a little brain damaged. either way man this is the worst man-eating vagina movie i have ever seen.

this move is bad on so many levels i don't even know where to start. ok - the good points - peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. some of the landscape photography was stunning. that's about it. oh, and it was a nice touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in freemanville, i figure it was a nod to the buffalo soldiers. the movie starts sort of ok but the characters are so flat, so comic book, so 'much', the bad guys are just over the top bad, i choke trying to describe them further. the spanish-cuban-american war was 1895-1898 with america being involved only in april to august of '98. i think the movie said it took place in 1893 (i could be wrong but i don't want to look at it again to check). a big part of this movie hinged on the kkk killing jessie's daddy. well boys, the original kkk started in 1865 and was destroyed by president andrew johnson in 1871. the klan wasn't even around during the time period of this movie. of course the nasty bas**rds got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that. but for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot. i think i could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and i'm done. i didn't know that boyz2men and other bands like that got their inspiration from new orleans street singers from the 1890's. i also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for sioux women in the 1890's...but then i was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1" nails... we just about died laughing and i like a cheesy western more than most people do. such a waste of talent and money - this really had the chance to show a part of american history that isn't well known. http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/bkcwboy2.htm for some more information. this could have been so good but it was just....bad from 1-10 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because mario looks good in his hat and there was an appaloosa horse in the film.

an awful film; badly written, badly acted, cliched, hackneyed, dross. the premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire. it is a curious mix of a bad 1950's randolph scott b movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western. the villains are cardboard, the flashbacks laughable, the dialogue excruciating.the deliberate anachronisms (such as 'victorian' rap singers and modern swear words like "motherf****er"), are irritating to the extreme.a frankenstein monster that died on the lab table.

i think south park is hilarious, and i have no problem w/them taking shots at people on the left, but you'd think that, after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war, and then being gasp right along, they would have the sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is.gore is fair game, but please, what do the republicans have to do, how bad do they have to f^&k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they aren't just trying to do the best they can, and that they have done some true screwing up...or maybe just go after rush limbaugh...hes a good target...or even just make fun of condoleeza rice's gap teeth.

c.h.o.m.p.s. is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s disney family comedys-the cat from outer space or unidentified flying oddball, for instance. utterly devoid of anything creative, beating the same cliches to death, yet vaguely entertaining in a mindless sort of way. the actors won't win any awards, nor will the director, writer, or fx crew, but in its inoffensive ness and bland predicatability there is some vague entertainment to be had. the idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a colander. the incredibly repetative disco soundtrack will stick in your head, so beware.

weird.this is a tv movie,yet the rating on the box says it's rated r.there's nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an r rating.aside from that,though,the movie is very slow and pointless.i mean the idea was good,but nothing was done with the storyline.it just wasn't developed.it's mildly creepy,and the acting is actually quite good,better than the movie deserves.i don't see myself watching it again anytime soon,if ever.there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one.i haven't seen too many wes craven films,so i can't really compare it to any of his others.as for this movie itself though,i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed.for me,i can't give chiller a higher rating than 3/10

a few minutes in: "not credible. what idiot wrote this?" but, "what's going on...who's the bad guy...then there's that rebecca de mornay." time passes....the end."not credible. what idiot actually watched the whole *@#! thing!"

forgive me, but this work of director peter hall is horrendous. if you can't get to us with the plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. that surely reaches the audiences. this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. and, believe me, i saw it coming before she opened the package. how predictable can you get. take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way. i have never been a fan of de mornay and this performance tells me why. overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, i found her rather silly and definitely boring. i did like banderas, but felt bad that he had to play opposite de mornay. he has done much better in other films namely "philadelphia" where he had some honesty in his dialogue. in this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real. but the writers, green & rush, did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue. please, let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment. some of us aren't fooled by corny plots, bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue. seeing her get away with it, made me furious.

what a stinker!!! i swear this movie was written by a computer that took a whole pile of other movies and merged them all together into this platypus of film. ouch!

this derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way, mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out, and because the director, peter hall, manages to stage a pretty hot (and quite bold) sex scene. but the finale, though unexpected, is preposterous, and the whole plotting (complete with childhood traumas and multiple-personality disorders) reveals itself to be unbearably cliched, especially as far as motivation is concerned. (*1/2)

for a scientifically-engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime, chomps was a chump.all i ever saw chomps do was sit, or walk, or run. or run, then walk, then sit... and then get back up again and stretch, and then walk, and then jog to k-tel dance hits. and sometimes it had all the answers to the daily jumbo. but mostly it just sat a lot.all i am saying is: in a celebrity death match, chomps couldn't take out mr. bigglesworth.

i thought sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" ending in movie history, but of course i was wrong. i had no disillusions that this movie was going to be good. unfortunately, it was worse than i expected. the worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens.

with so many good movies coming out in 1995 (particularly "mortal kombat" and "seven"), unfortunately, there had to be some bombs as well, and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring, predictable plot and a lousy ending. it seems that antonio banderas hasn't been able to find a decent script since "desperado," the only remarkable film he's done. anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who demornay's stalker was from the beginning. her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but muddle an already paper-thin story. pity that dennis miller was wasted in this film; this part resembles his eerily similar role in "the net." the convoluted ending had me shaking my head, as i pretty much did throughout the entire movie. plus, any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets the thumbs-down from me. to make a long story short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, then avoid this at all costs. never talk to strangers...especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10

my god, the things that passed for entertainment in this country...this is *not* the "tom and jerry" you may have enjoyed on saturday mornings, featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse. this is a much earlier animation series, featuring a pair of mutt-and-jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animation.this particularly vile outing, apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time, has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to africa, necessitating black-face make-up, exaggerated "negro" dialect and "feets, don't fail me now" situations.it only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film, the american view of africans hadn't progressed much. then again, at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.

i was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time. they disguise themselves in the "blackface" fashion because they fly to africa and they even act like stepin fetchit and all the others rolled into one. there are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics, being a mixed woman i have the right to say this, but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try merrie melodies "coal black and de sebben dwarfs" or "angel puss" you won't find them on dvd because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream, but you can find them on a site as youtube. i don't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early america was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions, not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation, i know it was 1932, but i have seen better for its time."plane" unnecessary. -1 out of 10.

tom and jerry are transporting goods via airplane to africa. but being white men, they're worried they won't be safe, so they put on blackface to fit in. once they're wearing it, they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. they crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. before reaching land, they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks, a swordfish and a whale. once on land, they're frightened by fantastic creatures, and duck into a cave. inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface. and upon exiting the cave, things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals."plane dumb" is an especially sloppy effort from van beuren studios. one example: a lion, unknown to tom and jerry, enters the cave before they do. but the animators must have forgotten about it, because the lion never appears again. another example is the ending that's not an ending: it's just an arbitrary stop.according to a youtube poster, the cartoon "was originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular 'negro' comedy team known as miller & lyles. but aubrey lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed, and co-directors john foster & george rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'tom & jerry' story."they shouldn't have bothered. the crude animation and poorly-executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end.

while credited as a tom and jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier mutt-and-jeff rip-off featuring them going to africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in. while the dialect humor is mostly lame, there is a brief musical sequence involving "black skeletons" that was entertaining. i have to ask however, how could tom and jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times? one of many entries produced by the van beuren corporation for distribution by rko radio pictures before rko made a deal with disney. only worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when.

tom & jerry are visiting africa and disguise themselves in an "amos-n-andy" fashion. they even act and talk differently, with the standard degrading usage of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era. aside from the offensive images, this cartoon just isn't very good. why were they going to africa in the first place? apparently just to provide the audience with another amos-n-andy and the additionally overused cannibalistic portrayal of native africans. the only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an octopus.worth one view, which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignorance could prevail...(note. i consider some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images very good. it all depends on if there is good content surrounding the cartoon, or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those incorrectly portrayed. in other words, if you get rid of "mammy," shuffling feet, the poor grammar, and black-face with giant lips images is there anything left? in the case of "plane dumb" there is not.)

dumb is right: tom and jerry reach their goal of a non-stop air flight to africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives. they put on "blackface," crash the plane, try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean, and then survive the wild animals once they get on landhaving read a few reviews before seeing this, i knew what to expect. it was simply these two guys doing their amos and andy/stepin' fetchit impressions. offensive to blacks? of course, but that's the 1930s for you. some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. the main fault i had with this cartoon was the audio, as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying.in all, a curiosity piece, but don't let the racism stop you from checking it out. at least it gives you an idea of how times have changed....for the better.

maximum risk is quite surprising to a person that has seen more then on of his movies. director ringo lam made an average action-movie, that can be compared with most of the other mid-quality action movies, what is a special predicate to a `muscles from brussels`movie. it has a quite classy style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautyful natasha henstridge. even vandamme doesn´t make you crying by his acting, he does a relatively good job. of course you may not compare maximum risk (oh, what a creative title!) to `ronin`, but after watching `knock off` it´s the hell of a good movie... in special standards, of course.

jean claude van damme's movie career seems to have gone to hell in a handcart so how ironic to see him playing a character who meets the same fate in a literal manner at the very start of the movie ! it's also interesting to note how very , very similar the plots of his movies play out regardless of who the producer , director or screenwriter are . van damme usually plays a character who is living in france then due to a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and it's up to van damme to get revenge helped by a character he's just met . look at awol or legoinairre or many other films that feature the headline " starring jean claude van damme " and they all feature nearly the same type of story structure . this doesn't mean they're identical of course , just very similar and if you've seen one van damme movie you've basically seen them all . it's the same with maximum risk

this is not a good film.i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to, as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought. this one has no redeeming features. it has a distinct lack of plot, humour, acting, direction etc etc. a real stinker on all levels. i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie, although i came damme close here. avoid at all costs.

"maximum risk" is a step sideways for van damme and just more of the uninspired b-movie action stuff we've come to expect from films featuring the macho belgian martial artist. the flick has gaping plots holes, goofs galore, a messy conglomerated plot, and a gorgeous henstridge who spends most of her time looking like she's waiting for a cue. "maximum risk" doesn't distinguish itself in any way and will likely not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audiences. (c-)

though predictable and contrived, not a bad movie. it entertains, which is all van damme hopes to do. the omnipresent "twin" device is again used (as in a large number of van damme's movies) but it is not bothersome except to long time fans. natasha is gorgeous and worth watching. action is decent, nothing spectacular for van damme but exciting. i can recommend to van damme fans and even to those who aren't but don't mind an action film with a good looking lead couple. the russian mob is a nice concept and topical for the day. clearly, not his best film but by no means his worst.

greedy land baron in the tiny western town of prairie city wants all the ranchers off their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil, and when a swedish farmer refuses to leave, he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. the farmer's seafaring son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. another lawlessness-in-the-west story, with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards). derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch, with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his dander up. sterling hayden's half-hearted swedish accent is a big problem, though he cuts a sturdy, sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth-watching. director joseph h. lewis stages most of the scenes stiffly, like a tv western, and gerald fried's bugle-heavy score is no help, though the rich black-and-white cinematography by ray rennahan is excellent. an independent production released via united artists, the film has a bizarre start (beginning with shots from the finale, followed by shots from the movie's midsection), yet it does have a certain needling power which most assuredly gets the viewer on hayden's side. ** from ****

i unwittingly walked into this "trap" of a movie.if i could turn back time or simply get a refund i would be happy.it was 7:30pm and cinderella man didn't start until 10pm so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and i dare say god reached out his hand (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film.it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, however, there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing. this movie was at most worthy of a highschool project budget...and i think i've seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis laloupe.maybe it's because i'm canadian and this film was for the la fudge-packing crew and their sympathizing dames. woe was me when i realized that then entire audience save me cracked up at all the jokes and entendres...i fully understood the hinted humor...but i just could not relate.this show did show me, supposedly, how gay men date and build relationships. however, even if it was their purpose of the movie, i feel that the "gayness" was focused on too heavily....the humanity seemed lacking....but again, maybe that was the point...simply to be avant-gard...and to make a splash.i guess with a low budget and poor equipment, you have to make your movie as "loud" as possible in order to get crowds and cash return. i really wish i had simply read my sheldon van auken instead. hehe...i was totally the wrong audience.

i really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. it's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. all the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off. sebastian hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles marc anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death. the banana scene fringed on self-absorption, seemingly showing how much movement was in his boxers. but in his defense it was his first movie as director (that i'm aware of) and i appreciate his labor of love. it just left me empty despite what was trying to be said. ultimately i think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. from what i've seen of the 'extras', there is a real story behind this and, perhaps when i finish watching them, i'll appreciate this attempt more.

julien hernandez is certainly an attractive and likable on screen persona. in fact, his character pretty much carries this whole film, or what's worthwhile about it. the problem is, with the exception of his gal pal (played by marisa petroro) and paul lekakis (as a trick/date/ boyfriend for some of the characters) no one else even comes close. hernandez plays a 30- something director of cuban heritage, and unknown sexuality, who comes to l.a. and gets a job making a gay documentary. in the process of meeting a group of gay people while finding subjects, he comes out...but very s l o w l y. even at 88 minutes, the film has obviously been stretched out and padded with various film-school devices, most of which only end up pointlessly interrupting the narrative (which ain't much to begin with) or pointing out the overall amateurish-ness of the film-making. which is a shame, because there's a love story in here somewhere, and the final three minutes, when hernandez's sebastien finally clicks with a wealthy west hollywood party- thrower (nicely underplayed by lonnie henderson) and they share some sexy soulful kisses, it works despite all that came before. but we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations: why would handsome dante have a eurotrash priss for a boyfriend? he wouldn't. and don't even get me started on sebastien's friend paulie's "rules" for dating -- no gay man i know, hell no sane person, period, would put such constrictions on himself or others. and please tell me how sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is normally fairly shmushy, right?) stuck up his butt and has to go to a doctor to get it removed? i noticed hernandez won an award for this film as a "short" -- it probably should have stayed that way. all this said -- i'd look forward to seeing hernandez on screen again, in a better scripted comedy with more assured direction.

this movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a "10") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots. this is the type of plot that sex in the city could handle in a half hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie. a perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie. some of the back story is merited, but too much time, for example, was spent on daria character with the anal sex boyfriend and on the back story for paulie, who was not a realistic character, although the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given. the worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts: from typos in the typed material, to bad jumps and edits, poor camera positions, angles, lighting problems throughout and, most glaringly, a poorly written script with a badly developed concept. if the writer (also the director and lead) had collaborated with someone, he might not have ended up with a 100% rotten score on rotten tomatoes, which further belays the ability of anyone to truly believe the people who gave it a 10 on the rating system here.

i walked into heart of gold thinking i was going to watch a documentary about neil young. instead, i witnessed a self-serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. highly rated by aging baby boomer critics, directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, heart of gold is a bore-fest from start to finish, that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie. neil young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a cushioned rocking chair of middle-of-the-road mediocrity. what happened to the raunchy guitar of his earlier solo efforts? i guess all of his fuzz boxes rusted out and his over-driven vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. as far as demme goes, this is the daring director of something wild & melvin and howard? a student filmmaker could have made a more daring film than this poorly visualized surface performance film. don't waste your $$ on heart of gold and go straight to the last waltz and gimmie shelter. and if you really want to dig deep into the personality of a rock and roll icon, scrounge up a copy of chuck berry: hail hail rock and roll which is sorely out of print. and baby boomers, don't bother squawking about how this review is jaded by someone younger. i too am one of those baby boomers who listened to cinnamon girl on acid and danced in the streets to the stones' street fighting man. go back and watch don't look back or gimmie shelter and then come back and tell me that heart of gold has any worth as a document.

of course i have disappeared into the movies. the neil young concert film 'heart of gold.' there have been many great concert films through the years. the best being martin scorsese's 'the last waltz' which filmed the band's last concert at filmore west. a phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film, that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music, and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two you could change the world...as you can guess i felt all five to the bottom of my twenty four year old soul. neil young was in 'the last waltz.' they had to digitally, before digital actually, they had to manually scrape a big hanging cocaine rock that extruded from his nose so in the film there's a bright light that is not the star of bethlehem dangling above his lip and below his nostril...it's a famous bit of rock and roll history. but 'the last waltz' was made when the band and neil and everyone else was in their thirties and 'heart of gold' was filmed last year when neil is in his sixties and his band looks as if they are in their late nineties and the entire movie could visually be used by the christian right and the dea in the same way that those ohio state patrol films of the perils of drunk driving were used when i was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging through front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch. close your eyes and it is a terrific concert, open them and view dorian grey's hidden portrait. case in point, the once ethereally beautiful emmylou harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with neil and from dark to light appearing to be a ring wraith leapt full borne out of the river in front of rivendale. ghastly, ghostlike, a nose that doesn't appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make buttons on dolls look lifelike, and the ability to express any emotion, human or not, constrained by unrestrained over indulgence in botox. my mind reeled...porcupine...peru...jack daniels...living hard for decades...my god...sweet emmylou harris who i saw sing for free at fred's in boulder, a face a 2000 year dead pharoah would not accept. but the voice, as pure as a thick lipped bottle of boulder beer brewed from the waters of boulder creek and i closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrssss (an homage...one must use homage at least once in any film review...to fred's hamburgers on boulder mall and the steve martin pink panther movie). it would have been a terrific concert sitting in the dark in ryman auditorium, maybe twenty rows back. but, close up, in close ups, it was a medieval morality play depicting the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life. the concert theme, emblazoned on the scenery, a prairie wind...the last song, massed guitars (i counted eight) and i wondered if irony was at play. i don't think so. a native american bass player, a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like buffalo bill, a piano player whose face looked like the screamer's face in munch's the scream, the chick singers (actually matronly singers, mostly reminding one of the lost youth of senior united flight attendants still plying the friendly skies) dressed in matching full length distressed denim dresses...no it was played straight. none of them had seen, i would bet, a mighty wind. it will be a great cd, and would be glad to tell tales of hippy dippy boulder when neil was a long haired canadian crooner whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to mirror heartache and loss, feelings as universal then as now. but, only in a dark bar.

barbara payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in hollywood. raymond burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who mrs payton is desiring to blow the joint with. there is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the payton tramp. i watched this only part way through because its really awful, so didn't even get to see the star of the show---which i guess is a gorilla that the voo-doo hag turned someone into or whatever.....who cares. i give this one half star out of a possible ten. it's not even campy, just really bad.

this movie was cheesy and it was more than that. it was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. i had to see how bad it was because of the title. before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. i was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. she should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. there are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave. this isn't just a b movie, it's more like a z movie. i didn't even see any bananas for a wedding gift. oh, right he wasn't cursed yet.

the cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; we have barbara payton, raymond burr, lon chaney jr., tom conway, paul cavanaugh and woody strode in front of the camera and writer-director curt siodmak, cinematographer charles van enger, editorial supervisor francis d. lyon and production assistant herman cohen behind it. the ill-fated payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the african jungle where she lives on husband cavanaugh's plantation: doctor conway secretly desires her while hot-headed foreman burr's approach is, quite literally, more hands-on. on the other hand, chaney is (surprisingly enough) the laid-back but knowing authoritarian figure and strode is a native police official. the plot is very simple but, frankly, does not make a whole lot of sense: after a particularly agitated dinner complete with thunderstorm, burr and cavanaugh (art imitating life  more on that later) come to blows in the garden over their affection for payton and, conveniently for burr, a large snake just happens to be crawling near where cavanaugh hits the ground! witnessing the event from behind the bushes, payton's enigmatic maid (a native witch, no less), for some inexplicable reason, puts a curse on burr (who has in the meantime married payton) that periodically turns him into a gorilla...starting from his very wedding day (when his hand briefly turns hirsute)! consequently, burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end  even if the ape creature itself is barely glimpsed throughout the film. it must be said, however, that the version that i watched ran for just 56 minutes when the 'official' length is elsewhere given as either 66, 70 or 76!! therefore, the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorilla's subjectively-shot chasing of payton in the jungle, with the former being itself pursued by the gun-toting chaney and conway. to get back to the film's tragic blonde leading lady for a minute: after a promising start in movies next to such hollywood legends as james cagney and gary cooper  in, respectively, kiss tomorrow goodbye and dallas (both 1950)  her career soon nose-dived into b (and lesser) grade territory thanks to her own 'colorful' off-screen antics: her most notorious misdemeanor was being the cause of a much-publicized bar-room brawl between suave husband franchot tone and brutish former lover tom neal which ended with the former in a coma and payton actually deserting him for the latter shortly thereafter!! but that was not all: nymphomaniac payton also boasted that woody strode was among her conquests (a controversial issue at the time); short-lived husband tone, having caught payton's infidelities on camera, spread the damning photographic evidence around hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a starlet  her last film appearance being edgar g. ulmer's murder is my beat (1955) which i happen to have in my "unwatched movies" pile. the last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on skid row in the throes of booze, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even a stabbing  before, eventually, dying in 1967 in her parents' home at the young age of 39!

it is a story as old as man. the jealousy for another man's wife and possessions. there are even commandments against it.in this story, raymond burr ("perry mason", "ironside") is the manager of a runner plantation who lusts after the owners wife and feels that he isn't treated with respect. the wife, the starlet barbara payton, who was trying to make a comeback after a string of sordid affairs, was lusting after burr, who killed her husband, paul cavanagh.but, lurking about was a strange woman, the housekeeper (gisela werbisek) who sees everything, and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the wronged, which also included another young woman (carol varga) to whom burr also professed love.burr is poisoned and becomes , or thinks he becomes, a gorilla. payton will have to mate with kong if she ever wants her marriage consummated, as he goes into the jungle every night.the end is predictable. but, the stirring question of this film is why payton would ever be afraid. with those sharply pointed missiles jutting out from her chest, no animal could get near her to do harm.

certainly not a bad little low budget film, this "bride of the gorilla", but nothing special, neither, and not memorable enough to be ranked among the meaningful sci-fi efforts of its time. director curt siodmak was an eminent scriptwriter during the 1930's and 1940's and delivered stories for some true genre classics ("i walked with a zombie", "the wolf man") but, as a director, he obviously lacked the required competences. "bride of the gorilla" is similar to the aforementioned "the wolf man" in story and atmosphere, but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful. both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night, but the titular gorilla doesn't look half as threatening as the werewolf, even though the film got released a whole decade later. during a cheesy opening speech, actor lon chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries, but actually there's no real mystery in the plot. it's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him. a native woman witnesses his crime and puts a spell on barney that causes him to transform into a hideously big gorilla at night... or maybe she just wants him to believe he's turning into a hideously big gorillalon chaney himself plays the police commissioner charged with the murder investigation while raymond burr (who starred in about a thousand perry mason tv-movies) portrays the greedy plantation manager/nightly gorilla. siodmak attempts to make the film look like a supernatural thriller  is it or is it not all just happening in barney's head?  fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungle-action. several of the jungle-settings are nicely pictured but the rest of the "special" effects are tacky and poorly done. still the acting is pretty good, barbara payton is looking beautiful and  although very predictable  the story is strangely compelling until the very end. weird movie, it probably voodoo-cursed me

the film is a pathetic attempt to remake ingmar bergman's "autumn sonata"(1978) starring ingrid bergman,liv ullman and erland josephson.it did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out.it is time film journalists like khalid mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking. it makes me sad when potentially good film-makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of hollywood and european films.you've got to give the film-maker something though. the film he picked for copying is one of bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in european cinema.

this film is perfect for over the top cheesy zombie lovers. its a film you can laugh at from the acting to the terrible zombie action. that being said, i gave this a 4 outta 10 for effort cos horror is a hard genre to make. going down the list the bad points of this film were as following.#bad make up #terrible sound and sound effects #really bad continuity #cheesy dialogue #one song played through the whole film #stein couldn't act and in my opinion one of the worst i've seen #terrible ending #racist moment and stealing simpson's character namedthe good points #good costume #police officers seemed to have the best acting exp #the actors with less lines or small roles did appear to be better #good attempt with gorei don't wanna bad mouth the film, its funny to watch cos of these bad points and i think thats what makes this film ok. if it was any better i don't think it would of made any difference but it wouldn't be interesting to see a remake with all the same cast as i believe they have possibly improved over the last 7 years.

for an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. the effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. the acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better "display" than some films in the shoestring budget category. it's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. the plot as a whole isn't the worst. it's a resident evil rip off about an evil corporation invading a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies. i would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big baddie just be another "super" zombie. i try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned!! spoiler alert!!! not only do some of the cast just seem to shrug past the zombies (the same ones are recycled over and over but at least they have more then 5 people playing them). but one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me. the deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the evil corporations payroll. he kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess. the deputy has just shown us that he is a real bad person too and talks like he can clean it up (meaning kill all the surviving witnesses) no problem. but then 2 seconds later, he is helping them out. there was no real "change of heart" emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy just minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out no problem to being their savior. there was no incident or anything to make me buy into this. worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks, otherwise you will not enjoy this.

two years after this short, the last "our gang" short was made. after seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted that much longer. the quality of "our gang" nosedived soon after moving from hal roach to mgm, and this short is a perfect example. the gags are all very unfunny and froggy's last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time. a very poor example of film making.

froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him.okay our gang comedy works in fits and starts. the bits work but i don't think it really works as a whole. part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down. i think in a weird way the film just sort of misses. its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have amounted to something more than a misfire. worth trying if you lower your expectations

admittedly, i watched the mst3k version of this, but it's not actually too bad outright, at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred.the story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a "reform school" called girls' town. along way, races, redemption, and wackiness (unintentional) happen. the story and acting are a little flat, as is the action. however, the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored.overall, just a simple sub par 50's flick, but far from the worst movie ever made, with some bright spots in the movie (the ave maria sequence was good for me).if you get a chance to watch the mst3k version, you won't be disappointed. by it self, not so much, but i can think of worse methods of torture ("spiker" anyone?).

this movie is a laugh and a half. from the first scene, where we have an appearance of mel torme as a big, bad jaguar drivin' stud muffin gang leader(and that's a giggle-fest in itself), to the final image of mamie van doren, now a rehabilitated angelic teen strolling out of the prison(errr..loving girl's home run by iron fisted nuns), you can't stop shaking your head. the cast of this movie is a cheesy list from mel and mamie to the talentless paul anka(all i wanted through most of this movie was for him to just stop singing!) and the king of forty year old teens, dick contino. gloria talbot, playing a humorless teen girl with more than a few chops(judo, not acting) i last saw in the horrible misogynist 50's romp leech woman, with a hairstyle so bad it looked like a dead woodchuck that had been squashed by a mac truck.mamie is a bad, bad girl-she smokes, swears, runs wild, hits teachers, and runs around with gang leaders. she dumps her idiot jaguar driving boyfriend chip(who we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl, before he falls off a cliff-nice guy), and proceeds to take up with dick contino instead. whether this is a step up for her is anybody's guess. mel shows up at a party she's at with her new beau, and accuses her of pushing the nasty chip off the cliff. while i'm sure that she would have liked to, she wasn't there. a stupid fight scene between contino and his gang and mel and his jazz freaks ensues, with some hilariously bad moves on both sides.mamie ends up being sent to girls town, a reform school..errr...loving home for erring girls..run by sister iron pants and her fellow sisters of correction. she annoys the nuns(and us) by scatting, tossing off sullen one-liners, and just generally showing how bad she is. she quickly runs into gloria talbot, playing one of the misbehaving girls, who gives her a chop sockey so that she knows her place. she meets a limp noodle of a girl who's obsessed with paul anka's character(why?). this little drip becomes her 'henchman'. there's a long bit of movie where nothing much happens, except st. paul of anka keeps showing up and proving how saintly he is. he sings way too much in this interval, until you want to smack him in his huge snozz to just make him be quiet! and mamie's little sister, played by princess of father know's best fame, calls her to tell her she's in trouble. turns out it was sis who went out with the chipster, and now mel's blackmailing her because he found out. the girls all break out to go save her, with a hysterical fight scene between the girls and mel and his boys. this is after a race between mel and dick that is just so stupid that it boggles the mind. the overage teenagers in this corny movie have a fabulous good time romping through what is basically a silly, badly written and morally preachy film that accomplishes none if its aims-unless its aim was to make you laugh out loud.

with the little respect it deserves, i would like to state that this movie was horrible. the filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and production value was obviously lacking a great deal. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard laugh and then wasting two more hours of their life enduring a truly painful experience. i'm surprised i even found this movie on the $1 dvd rack where it was aptly placed. i thought maybe it was going to be good and that i might discover some amazing independent film - i was wrong. i wish i had never seen this movie. my 3-year-old cousin couldn't make a worse film. i'm glad i saw the film because i can finally tell people i've seen the worst movie ever made, and be sure of it.

this movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are not worth the wait. after an unexplained argument between two guys picking up litter in a drive-in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving! hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over. at least i think it's inane, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it renders the dialogue at times almost inaudible. finally the camper van arrives, at night, at a gas station where the family get out, have another inane conversation, before driving off. the camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away. he talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him, and how he came to make the movie.a nice idea which almost (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worth the pain.as the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company.all sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming.this movie was obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost. comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking (or shouting) at once. so much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously - robert altman can do this sort of thing well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techies, and editing facilities. everyone shouting at the one mike which, by the sound of it, was hidden in a dustbin in the next room, does not make for clarity.

gave it two stars because the dvd cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure. i paid a dollar for it at the local dvd exchange and i want my money back. i have a couple of good movies(at least i think they're good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. after seeing this, i'm really insulted by that. light years worse than anything i've ever seen, i can't even recommend this as a campy joke movie. it is so bad, instead of making you laugh it makes you angry. how did this awful film find any kind of distro? i can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish dvd authoring would suggest. to the producers of this "movie" get out of the business, it's obvious you have no talent for it.

being (somewhat) an independent filmmaker myself, i really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea. on paper. on 16mm film, however, it's awful. i didn't realize the thing was made in the mid 90's because the film was so grainy and bad i would have sworn this was one of those 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream. and the sound! ugh, i don't know what kind of mic they were using to record but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the entire thing. i guess i shouldn't judge too harshly, after all, how many feature films has my company put out? none, but i'd like to think that we'd at least have good picture and sound quality to go with our poor acting, writing, and directing. a+ for idea, f-- for execution.

cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value, even on the so bad its entertaining front. a friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing st. vincent depaul clothes bin. okay, that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin, not a crappy old vhs bin, something the less fortunate members of our society don't really need to make their lives better. it could be considered a mercy. watching a movie like cyclone would really only add to their problems. anyway the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isn't even properly exploited. the two 'high speed' chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 kmph and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it. there is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used, at the film's climax, and it is laughably ineffectual, or just laughable, when it is. this includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly. the rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler. lots of bad actors, yes even combs and landau suck in this, most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot. there are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop. comedy of the sub benny hill horny old man can't stop staring at the female leads chest variety. basically the 'money' scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material. skip it.

the only thing i expected that this film didn't have was an intelligent, talking motorcycle.this film is just plain awful. i gave it 1 star, which of course, means i enjoyed it tremendously. bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad fight choreography. the only real actor in this movie is martin landau, who of course does a good job playing the villain, although the character is your standard cardboard cutout evil ceo/villain. even the so-called "plot twist" at the end was no shock.there was so much to make fun of in this movie, i enjoyed it a lot. and it did have a few impressive car wreck stunts.like bad movies? check this one out, ouch. want a good movie? not here.

this movie was in a box set with 20 others, with varying quality, & i can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heap.it is pointless to go through the plot, what there was of it, picking out what was wrong, as i haven't got all day & life is to short, which reminds me, i have just lost around 85 minutes of mine watching this tripe.the acting was diabolically bad in a way that made it funny, though only just, whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any laurel & hardy fans groan. one of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic t*ts, which would have been okay if i hadn't had to watch them bob around whenever she waddled on the screen.the lowest i can give is one, & it probably deserves that for having heather thomas in it, as she was certainly sexy & shapely, though her acting was as bad as everyone else.

rarely does one find a movie so bad that it achieves the often-sought paradigm of having so little redeeming value that that alone makes it worth watching. "cyclone," i am happy to report, is such a film.i knew i was in for something good as soon as i found the videotape. i am at least its fourth owner: it has a "used movie sale! $9.95" sticker on the front, and a yard-sale sticker for one dollar. i picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents.the used movie sale! sticker covers much of the front cover artwork, meaning that what i see is a truly odd blended still of the front of the cyclone super bike, a car flipping over on fire, and heather thomas, wearing flouncy eighties hair with her mouth open in an expression that says, "i 'ave a 'ooth ache." i saw that and thought, "all right." the case, honestly, was enough ("with nowhere to turn and no one to trust, teri is plunged headlong into a maze of danger and deceit"), but i surprised myself by actually getting around to watching it. i always make time for the really bad films. that "fight club" tape can wait.meet teri. teri is a stunningly well-crafted character, as we can tell from her introduction, in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and, later, her legwarmers. then teri goes off to hook up with her boyfriend for the evening that goes horribly wrong. before she knows it, teri is driven "straight into a web of deadly double-crosses in cyclone." the vhs box tells it like it is.left out of the box summary - perhaps out of some faint hope that actual copies of this film would be sold - is how awful the acting is. it might have been just me, but i kept thinking i could read the characters' thoughts through their eyes. "this is dumb," thinks heather thomas. "i know," thinks bad guy with too-wide mouth.a driving force (no pun intended) for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases. those were actually pretty good, although i'm inclined that gasoline doesn't need coaching on how to explode. what really impressed me is that, in all the chases, the streets were pretty much empty. it's like there are only twenty people in this huge city.i know what you're thinking. you're thinking, "gee wilikers! i have to see this movie!" the sad thing, though, is that you can't find it. oh no. "cyclone" is a film that finds you. just wait. some day - perhaps during lunch, perhaps late in the evening, perhaps "when military scientist jeffery combs ('re-animator')is murdered by hired assassins" - you will hear the rustle of legwarmers, and know that it is time.

although i am a fan of heather thomas and i have a few of her old bikini posters around here somewhere, i can honestly say that if the only movie i had ever seen her in was "cyclone", i would never be able to guess why she had made it as far as she had in show business.directed by fred olen ray (about as good an omen as seeing buzzards circle over head in the desert), this tale of a woman (thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as "b" movie as it gets (or in fred olen's case, "b minus").the cast itself should tell you something. it's not every movie that combines thomas with actors the calibre of beswick, hall, combs, donahue, tamblyn and landau (!!). if you're lucky, very few movies do. and even though they seem to be having fun, shouldn't some of that fun be passed on to the audience? i vote yes, seems they voted no.of course, if you ever wanted to see heather deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the "f" word and get hooked up to battery cables, you've probably been looking for this one. myself, i'll be content with old "fall guy" reruns.one star, given in hopes that when another "cyclone" hits town, heather runs for shelter. i know i will.

i was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a badly made low budget action flick that just doesn't have the talent for that. story is about a very beautiful woman named teri marshall (heather thomas) who's boyfriend rick (jeffrey combs) works for a secret agency and he has invented a motorcycle that is bullet proof and can shoot lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can shoot lasers as well. the head of the agency bosarian (martin landau) has made a 5 million dollar deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill rick and teri and collect the bike. a tall blond thug named rolf (dar robinson) and his partner hanna (dawn wildsmith) manage to kill rick but teri survives. while at home she discovers a video tape that rick left describing his invention that helps teri on what to do next.*****spoiler alert*****teri is being chased by several agents and she gets caught and tortured but doesn't talk about where a piece of the motorcycle that is needed but she gets help from a federal agent named waters (martine beswick) where they end up using the motorcycle for a bloody shoot-out.this film is directed by fred olen ray who has made his career out of making ultra-low budget exploitation films but he made a dire mistake here by leaving out the exploitation aspect and trying to make an action film. aside from a quick shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a ray film is no where to be found. i don't think anyone was expecting thomas to get naked but she doesn't wear one sexy outfit. not that it stopped me from ogling her in those tight jeans and admiring her near perfect form but ray really blew it in this case. like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like robert quarry, huntz hall, troy donahue, tim conway jr., michael reagan, and russ tamblyn. stuntman dar robinson died shortly after this was made and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. you have to wonder why landau would waste him time with such junk like this but i was interested in the casting of combs in a very rare romantic role. is thomas any good in this film? who cares! i think she showed that she could have become a popular "b" movie starlet if she wanted but it never did happen. ray wastes everyone's time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker.

low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story. this movie is also known as lady frankenstein. the alluring tania frankenstein(sara bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. baron frankenstein(joseph cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. supporting cast features mickey hargitay, paul whiteman, paul muller and herbert fux. a rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. still a fun watch.

mel welles, you might remember him as mr. mushnick in roger corman's little shop of horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr. frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. you see, tania frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. the story is tissue-thin here, and one gets what one might expect: lots of leering and suggestive comments(surprisingly most from the female lead), special effects that are not so special, acting that lacks depth of characterization, and not really much action or suspense. and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling, lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable - not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless. italian actress rosalba neri aka sara bay/bey plays the baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal. she oozes desire and seduction quite well. her performance is pretty one-dimensional, but she is quite lovely and plays over-the-top a little too well. she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. poor joseph cotten, now regulated to european horror films for money, plays the father in a brief yet competent performance. he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear. as for the rest of the cast, paul muller is somewhat effective as dr. charles marshall, the baron's assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, policeman(i wasn't buying this)mickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers - despite what you might think not to her satisfaction. where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script, weak performances, and lackluster direction all head further south. the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s. while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think, lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones.

what a terrible movie! the acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play, or a story driven pornography film. this is not pornography in this film, but there sure is a lot of gratuitous nudity! this is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film, one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star. also there are a million cops that die in this film. hardly offensive though since the violence is so unrealistic we can only laugh. but breasts pop out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times, if you enjoy really really bad movies check this one out. this is a bonnie and clyde type story, where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge. this film also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people i have ever seen rolling around naked!

i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse' drive-in cult classics (featuring crown international pictures releases) on dvd. as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets, i am growing to love many of crown international's movies -- especially, the creepy, erotic, psychological thrillers! death machines is not one of them.after seeing movies like malibu beach, the creeping terror and the pink angels, it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made; but, it doesn't have much going for it.no plot; really no story to speak of.the acting isn't evident  only the actor responsible for the terribly-played tony (with the thick, fake italian accent) made any attempt to "get into character." the score is annoying and pedantic.the only thing about this movie is why... what compelled the film-makers to make this film? did they think the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing crime bosses, 3) an ancillary bartender / karate school student character; and 4) his pitiful love-interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made? this is a complete waste of time and money, for you, me, the producers, writers, actors, and the director.

i'm from texas so i thought i knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. whenever she was on the screen i couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. take about stage presence! there seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. there was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away. all the hit men in this movie seemed a bit deaf, no one had to sneak up on them. the one handed 'hero' of this movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny. the bar-fight was pretty funny. there is a priceless scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judging from their expressions, it wasn't good for either one of them. it made me laugh out loud. this movie is on the 50 movie pack martial arts set if you want to see a lot of bad movies (with a few decent ones).

bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. i mention him only because there is an actor in death machines who looks just like him playing the owner of an italian restaurant. he appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a dragon lady (mari honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate. our hero (let's call him not paul from the diamond center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of the simpsons' luigi ("you lika da spaghetti?") and seems unimpressed when one of his patrons complains about the food. no, there's no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there's a red buddha in the pasta, the calling card of the murderous crime boss, who sends a statuette to each of her prospective victims. death machines is bad by any measure, and pretty boring, which is an even worse crime.

as bad as this movie is, i really like it. the poor acting, dialogue and action made it so funny. i loved john travis from omega cop and stayed up all night working out how the death machines checked in at the airport if they can't speak, probably had to shake/nod at the security questions. actually why can't they speak!? it fails to adhere to any sort of movie making convention which makes it strangely interesting to watch- just lots of people getting killed around a very loose plot surrounding hired killers - no "machines" as such and those weird face/mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear! i love the fact that there is no good guy in this film until about half way through and i love the numerous pointless scenes of that aeroplane landing - lots of people get killed who have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given about anything - do not expect to understand this film. instead admire how the main good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar - who is presented as the bad guy yet speaks out against the barman's decision to hire a scantily clad woman to dance badly in the corner for "entertainment" - all the good guys seem to enjoy this! why did old guy get to beat up our hero - and why did the random bloke decide to help old guy in the fight?! why did the hero collapse under one punch from old guy onto the bar where a stream of water jets out in the background so it looks like it's coming from his mouth? definite top 20 b-movie, must check for a part 2.

there is a point in the film where the female boss of the "death machines" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive i think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. except such is her delivery that it sounds like "leatherage." at which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. but it didn't. the boss lady had to do the talking as the "death machines" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does. interminably. there is action in the film but it is not that exciting and the plot staggers from one cliché to another. the three mute "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the film. hopefully there wasn't a sequel.

what a gargantuan pile of malodorous ordure! ye gods where to even begin with this one..well, mix crap acting (including one bloody infuriating woman who speaks as though she's either a) chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b) has just woken up after having undergone some extensive root canal surgery), editing that would appear to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced via the utilisation of an angle grinder, some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts 'action', a script that has ostensibly been written by a two year old and some of the most hideous and intrusively loud background music ever committed to any film and hey presto you have death machines aka the ninja murders (although note that surprise, surprise  there are in fact no actual ninja anywhere to be found in this sodding travesty!) in a nutshell, if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement bout of dysentery, then this must surely be it! avoid at all costs!

"death machines" takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss' opponents) and turns it into an unwatchable mess. i have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget, bad acting and incoherent script released as a so-called "movie". it's easily the worst martial-arts/action oriented movie i've seen in years, eclipsing even "ninja holocaust" (which at least had some good energetic fight scenes). the actual "star" of the movie is the white "death machine", (it's basically his vehicle) so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. he's in good shape, and he's not bad looking, but as an actor he's barely there - think chuck norris in "the octagon",only without any energy or emotion.this is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director...but you have to be arnold to pull this kind of thing off, and this guy is no arnold.the movie (and the director) can't seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed, like: who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled-mouthed asian lady her orders? how did the "gang war" end? why did the mush-mouthed asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? and what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick? it does, however, find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor (well, he looked like popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work. it's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also k.o.'s the movie's "hero", a bartender/karate student who was a victim of the "death machines" first major assignment (he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher). it follows this up with one of the most un-called for "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend i have ever watched. the segue makes no sense - at the end of the bar-fight, she's grimacing over his splayed limp body, and the next thing they are in a "tasteful" shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a hallmark card. btw, we never see the sailor again. and wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station, but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. the movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater-level actors floundering without decent direction. the three "death machines" come across as clods; the "hero" knows his lines but can't carry the movie, given that his character is an ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other minor parts are barely watchable. all this makes for a fairly poor movie- but the "dragon lady" does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else. she looks ridiculous; her tiny, inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and she talks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that screams "needed time with a dialog coach". poor lady - she was obviously way out of her element, and as far as i know, never appeared in a film again. add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; crappy film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly from hunger; and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business...and you have one lame movie. i got this as part of a 50 movie dvd compilation, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. it wasn't worth it. feh!

hi, everyone, oh, boy... this one is a lulu. it has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. there are three bad guys who, i guess, are the stars of this. they beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. usual stuff.the woman who is sending them on their missions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. it's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. she walks like she is balancing an egg on her head.the wardrobe is 70s leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. the bad novocain mouth woman wears red. a silk frock perhaps, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big.i actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. it lets us in on what happened earlier in the film.the police officers are ok. some bad, some good, all stupid except two. the two bright ones could have worked again in hollywood.the movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. the middle sucks. the guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. he is like a 1940s character actor. great voice.this one is a bit too long. the lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. it would have been easier to understand a bird.her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker.tom willett

a lot of good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets, plot devices and storyline. for example, why not plant a seed of erica's capability before the murder of her lover? why not develop erica and the cop's relationship slowly and convincingly? maybe contrast eric's metamorphis by including some other post-event facet, relationship, etc., in her life that she now rejects? why not have her injure an innocent bystander to underscore the wrongness in erica's actions.instead tbo exploits the revenge fantasy to its maximum level, giving insincere lip service to the "don't do this at home" messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimate.i'm not a jodie foster fan. after displaying some range in films like silence of the lambs, nell and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy, foster has slipped into a succession of roles where she plays the same hard-bitten, badgered heroine single-handedly overcoming evil. such is fine once or twice, but i'm getting too used to her "fight versus flight" close-up. tbo could have used a younger actress or one that more convincingly embraced being a woman in her forties (instead of 40-something foster playing a younger woman).tbo is a movie with substantial actors, financing and resources that manages to descend to junk.

i don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in, but i'm glad i'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish-ness of this thing. okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the "die hard" series, but seeing little jodie knock off a whole street gang, with a glock, as a novice yet...c'mon. all she needed was a bald head and a ripped t-shirt and she would be bruce willis. apparently, jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be. or she was living out some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black, or hispanic. even the dog is black. little blondie is the only good one and (except for a black police officer) everyone else in town is some nasty minority out to get her. has your fear of your acting talent declined so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) on camera in a dark, morose and somber neighborhood/film/cast? apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie...the dark knight.ridiculous plot holes, furniture chewing acting, gratuitous violence ("look girls! now you can do it, too!")...spend the time with your family instead of watching this drek.

i am very disappointed because i expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. the script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too. the director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. it tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. therefore i had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me. i was always asking what kind of movie i am watching. then i didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry. the end is also very disappointing. i cannot understand how jodie foster could have been nominated for the golden globe in this worst role of her life. jodie, therefore i liked very much panic room or flight plan. this is definitely one of the worst i have ever seen. 4/10.

the brave one is about a new york radio show host named erica bain (jodie foster). her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. she has her great fiancé david (naveen andrews), whom she is planning to marry. but one night while erica and david are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving david dead. erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. she buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection. but one day she's shopping in a store, and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead. it is then that erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a vigilante. killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others. at the same time detective mercer (terrence howard) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer, and in the process becomes friends with erica. erica begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people, but is unsure of whether or not what she's doing is morally right. and as her and mercer become closer, he doesn't even realize the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him.jodie foster gives a very good performance in the brave one. she portrays this type of violent, morally corrupted character brilliantly. terrence howard is also great in this movie. both have excellent chemistry together, and strengthen the film to a certain level. the brave one looks visually pristine, and conveys some brilliant camera work, but not all of it works to a great effect. the scenes where erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world. the camera swayed back and forth to the sides in an almost dream-like way, and really captured the moment with essence. whereas almost every time erica killed somebody, everything just had to go slo-mo and show her facial expressions in fine detail. the slo-mo was properly used when erica committed her first murder. but why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder? the camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film, but there a few scenes here that are just plain overkill.the brave one is very much about how these murders affect erica emotionally. her fiancé is killed by a group of thugs, and suddenly her love of new york city is turned upside down. she realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and she says so on her radio show. i don't completely understand this though. erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city, and that's pretty stupid. if she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious. erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane, murderous people. she really doesn't even have to go look for them, they just to come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong-doing. the brave one deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first, and then suddenly it glorifies it. the ending is very negative, and completely immoral and inhumane. it also negates the purpose of terrence howard's character, which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop, and suddenly his morals take a u-turn. the morals in the brave one become very fractured, and just plain shatter all over the place by the end. so violence is okay? it's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance? i pretty much refuse to believe that. you know why? because i have a conscience, which this film surely lacks. it is not right to take the life of another person, no matter how bad they are, or how much you hate them. erica bain sets out to stop these evil-doers, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills.jodie foster and terrence howard provide a lot of strength for this movie. the brave one contains a strong message, but that message is both immoral and wrong. this movie may look pretty, well acted, and intelligently strong. but it becomes pretty rotten by the end. i give the brave one a 1.5 out of 4. the message is very out of line and morally incorrect, and really can't be saved by the good acting.

this is by far the worst british comedy ever, how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me. the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander (from the fantastic coupling)right through the cast. the plot/story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas. a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows. describing it as britain's answer to ' meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog. britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so.

trekkies is really not a movie about star trek fandom. it's a freak show about those star trek fans who have no sense of reality. as a freak show, it's fine. but it is a mistake to think that this movie gives you an insight into star trek fans. most star trek fans cringe at what this movie shows.

this owes a great deal to the plot of captains courageous. although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. when the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. however, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where moran is concerned. the inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish moran and she for him. in the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united. some interesting dialogue points out that moran belongs to no man -"and no woman." (a nod to sappho here). dorothy dalton is appropriately sexless as moran and not too attractive either. valentino does well in a romantic, action role. his sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one. he is very appealing. this is no great film but it passes the time. what it really showcases is valentino's beauty and sexiness.

this movie was nothing like the book. everything was mixed up or changed. most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book.this movie never should have been viewed. it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing.i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j.d. robb.honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is.

'carolina moon' is an adequate made-for-tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and tori, played by claire forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. claire forlani (meet joe black, csi new york) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious oliver hudsom and a still luminous jacqueline bisset. the script, adapted from a nora roberts novel, is bog-standard and the plotis tediously predictable. that, however, is offset again by, like i said, the rather delicious oliver hudson.

i don't leave imdb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. i fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where i hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. and that was in the first five minutes. scene by scene it felt as though i'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. the tori character... bad bad acting. a true waste of time on dvd and a definite 'let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. if you watch this film, you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted.

a total and absolute waste of time. bad acting. bad story. predictable. simple. pathetic. after a while i was only watching to see what happens, since i'd already invested my time into it. totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this. honestly - just don't bother. a total and absolute waste of time. bad acting. bad story. predictable. simple. pathetic. after a while i was only watching to see what happens, since i'd already invested my time into it. totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this. honestly - just don't bother. a total and absolute waste of time. bad acting. bad story. predictable. simple. pathetic. after a while i was only watching to see what happens, since i'd already invested my time into it. totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this. honestly - just don't bother.

the story is about a psychic woman, tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? you really don't need to find out because, oh my god! this was so so so so bad! i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's. then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. but do not be fooled. the ending was predictable, the acting terrible (don't even get me started about the southern accents *y'all*) and the story was trite. just remember....you were warned!

first, let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is. so the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.i have spent my entire life living in the peidmont region of nc. i have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. i have lived in two small nc towns and charlotte and raleigh. on occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but i have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of gone with the wind.in response to gore_won from the atheist community. your comments reveal more about your warped psyche than it does about the movie. if we were to stretch our imaginations and pretend that there is anything realistic in this movie - which there isn't - then the truth is that bad people such as tory's father will always find some justification for their actions. the author chose religion as a counter to tory's supernatural abilities. your supposition that "the true character of the gospels" directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and misinformed interpretation i have ever heard. before you start spouting off about the gospels, maybe you should read them first.back to the movie. the dialog is flat, unnatural, and unbelievable most of the time. in particular, many of the things that kade said to tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context, or way they are said.the "exciting twist" at the end of the movie is lame, predictable, and lacks any credibility. some have also claimed that jacqueline bisset does a wonderful job in this movie, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also a stale, predictable, one-dimensional character. is that bisset's fault? i don't know.if you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old rerun of the muppet show, i recommend the muppet show.

i watched this movie for the hot guy--and even he sucked! he was the worst one--well, okay, i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too, he was even worse. the guy wasn't that cute in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can't stand up to his mom for the one he "loves" there's ever been. overall, and if this makes any sense to you, when i go to pick up movies at the video store, i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so/so, "well, at least it can't be worse than carolina moon." the most terrible movie, and the most terrible writing, acting, plot--everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips. it was the most horrid movie i will ever see, with gabriela way up there too. i hated it, and trust me, if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating, i'd choose that in a heartbeat.

i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of nora roberts' story. not having read the book, i don't know if this adaptation was faithful but i do know it wasn't good. actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to nora roberts.i planned ahead and watched carolina moon because of claire forlani. i've never been sure if she's a good actress. she's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. but, forlani wasn't alone. the performances were all over the place. oliver hudson was wooden and boring. josie davis was hammy. then, amidst all this b-rate acting, there's jacqueline bisset! she didn't have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but, even sleepwalking through that, she was miles ahead of the others.still, forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and i was not disappointed in that capacity here. i believe forlani can be more than eye-candy but, until she turns in a good performance in a good movie, she continues to excel at that. and, i'll continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in. fandom is fun that way.this movie though, carolina moon, was pretty bad. in addition to the bad acting (fake southern accents are really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. it wasn't horrible. it was just the boring made-for-tv caliber you're used to seeing on lifetime.if you're a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy carolina moon for that reason, as i did. if you're a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen, albeit in a lackluster form. otherwise, this movie is unremarkable.

this fantasy was utter garbage. i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. no wonder critics of the british media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. this movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. i'm sure it will do well in syria, iran, pakistan, and north korea, though. it's hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent commuters there is anyone in the u.k. who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism. i guess it's no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago. all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement!

the film begins in latvia just after wwi. being a history teacher, i knew that multinational troops occupied much of russia during this time. there was serious concern about the spread of bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. however, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "whites" win. however, the whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between. because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies, the whole expedition was doomed and left the ussr after only a year or two. however, what i did not know was that german troops were also involved. this surprised me, as they had just lost wwi and weren't in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition.this is the backdrop for the film, but it's also about a pro-communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops. she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her. so, she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. while none of this sex is all that graphic, this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldn't show to younger audiences.while the setting for this film is interesting, the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen. i don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films. i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression, as it will no doubt make it worse. the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seen--such as mostly martha, das boot, mother kusters goes to heaven, wings of desire or ali, fear eats the soul (among others).

leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can't sing. nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. from the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, mcclelland and stewart were involved in the production), he didn't know how to live, either. the woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. while irving layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, earle birney, was to remain nameless. i come from the generation just after cohen, where all the boys seemed to idolize him. his lack of commitment was probably just calling to them. i hadn't realized what a disappointing poseur he was back then. i was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his age.whiny, little rich prince, and not one memorable line in his oeuvre. no dedication to social change, outside of the sexual arena.you don't speak for my generation, lennie, and not for my gender. go back to the monastery and stay off the screen.as for my local public broadcaster, i will let them know what i think of them wasting my time on this guy. not a has-been, a never was...

naach would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. when it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) halle berry is no match for antra malli. while the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, naach had nothing at all.one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. yet again, i think that movie does not even deserve a 0. it has to be something negative or minus infinity.ok what about the plot outline? it is a funda-giving, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meet an useless, skill-less, loafer who aspires to be an actor tale. the story is so short that if just another sentence, imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler. about the story-telling? its like a bunch (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. don't try this movie if you have bought new dvd-player. you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd-player is struck. not its fault at all.at the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. at least he realized that both antra malli and abhishek bachan (at least at that time) can't speak dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. so, you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying noises from those antra-malli song sequences.do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema. once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it.there can't be worse 3 hour torture than this!

ram gopal verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some hollywood flick. his every film after shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre. occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one. for the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in bollywood. they fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep. and this despite the hot sexy hot hot sexy hot bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.but hey, you're not alone!! the editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production. only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose. ha, joke's on you. don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear. puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's starr-vinnng?!antara mali cannot act. rgv's lost his marbles. abhishek tried hard but failed. no plot. no story. nothing. she must've paid rgv handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch. what a super deal. no need for an acting career.such absolute rubbish can only be "made in bollywood" of course!

in most parts a lethally dull venture, naach is about this dancer/choreographer (antara mali) who regards herself as some kind of auteur, beyond the petty commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor beau (abhishek bachchan) build their careers on. nice idea, only it turns out that she has the most howlariously bad concepts about costumes and dance movements, stuff rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap south indian potboilers squirm in severe embarrassment.the story follows a yawn-inducing predictable pattern...dancer and beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex included)...beau gets success, but she spurns his attempts to help her...beau throws attitude and they walk out on each other...dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her 'to do what she wants'...incongruous effort bags even more incongruous popularity...beau's attempts to reach out are rebuffed until a climax where he bursts out about how he can't live without her...d-uh end.actually i didn't really expect this film to be much good. so why did i watch it? because i have an antara mali fetish. she's an actress with imo sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity. alas, her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution, ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an uncompromising character. to give her credit she puts in a game effort, shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress. i just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. abhishek bachchan also throws in a few good punches, the last scene salvaged somewhat by a simmering turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father.only recommended if you can sit through humongous piles of dogcrap for the return of a few grains of good moments courtesy the lead actors.

naach a more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. this one is a good portrayal, although i do not agree with it entirely. taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.ram gopal varma (rgv, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... i'm not even going to compare urmila and anthara.. both are good! the former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.anyways, i like anthara's character. she is true to her art, not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical. she is a dance scientist, actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. hey.. donald trump.. maybe you gotta ditch melania, here is anthara and you've already built a taj mahal... ain't this easy? abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow, who wants money, power, fame, etc. hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry, cannot get along, given their different styles and approach to life. this is very typical, but what i like about the movie is that it says what an abhimaan would say in its total runtime, in one scene! what's new? this movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. there is always something different about rgv's movies, this one is different too, it is way too slow for his standards. in parts, it drags one almost to sleep.noticeable it is tough to notice anything other than anthara in the first half of the movie. i think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) also, looks like anthara is a pro in yoga, she is way too flexible, almost like a prabhu devi. aby baby is improving as an actor with every movie. i am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends. the title song was really good, the music overall was above average.

i loved the first "american graffiti" with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock n' roll along with being the best teenager flick i've ever seen. the first film spawned the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic "star wars" before doing the prequels two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws, close encounters of the third kind and other films as well.somehow without those two, the magic died off."more american graffiti" shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve (ron howard) and laurie (cindy williams) are protesting against the vietnam war while their friend terry "the toad" fields (charles martin smith) is in the war himself and trying to get out. john milner (paul le mat) is still the hot drag racer in california where he never quite left home. the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy clark's debbie (terry's girlfriend), to the pharaoh's gang members, along with harrison ford and others really don't do much. the original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock n' roll from buddy holly, the fleetwoods, chuck berry, fats domino, bill haley and the comets, buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music. the soundtrack for "more american graffiti" is a mixture of rock, soul, country, hippie music, and whatever fitted the mood during the late 60's of protesting, drugs, sacrifices and more.after watching "more american graffiti" it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film (with the exception of dreyfuss's character) where it wasn't necessary. this film wasn't necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects.

the gang is back for more! ron howard and cindy williams are now married! her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent home.the issues of the 60's are brought to light here, but it's all over the place, beginning with new year's eve 1963, then three minutes later, it's new year's eve 1964, then three minutes later, it's new year's eve 1965, then three minutes later, it's back to 1963 again. martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago, and a couple of scenes later, this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off, the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture (or pictures, in some cases, as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time).if you want to watch this film, you have to watch this film, but i'd advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. wolfman jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background, but where'd he go? maybe he couldn't keep up with this film, either, and quit! 2 out of 10 stars!

i really don't think producer george lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as "more american graffiti" turned out to be. but in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. coming straight off the huge success of "american graffiti" and produced basically at the same time as "star wars", this film was the first that lucas successfully took away from coppola without having to bother directing it himself. the result is typical lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. the writer/director bill norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. while it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical "last big night" before school ends and kurt (ron dreyfuss) and steve (ron howard) are supposed to go off to college. one thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. there's a disposition of time, like in nick ray's "rebel without a cause" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. "more american graffiti" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with toad (charles martin smith) off in vietnam, his former girlfriend debbie (candy clark) partying with hippies in san francisco, steve and laurie (cindy williams) involved in student protests in berkeley, and john miler (paul le mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. in a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch john race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on new years eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. it's easy for the audience to become confused, and i think it's fair to say that we do. while the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.the best parts of the movie to me are the ones with candy clark in sf and charles martin smith in nam. some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. a good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in mackenzie phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. it was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why curt isn't in the movie because he's already in canada. instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. there's a black kind of satire to some of the vietnam stuff, very similar to what i would imagine lucas and john milius' original idea for "apocalypse now" would have been like. and there's some of that manic fun in the san francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. but still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see steve and laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. i think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. it just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of "two-lane blacktop" and so many better films.like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. the performances by country joe and the fish are great, and scott glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with candy clark is a sight to see -- i wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? i couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because i love the original so much. every couple of decades i guess i have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as i remember it being. it's a party killer but it's something that every fan of "american graffiti" or george lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. it shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. it makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that lucas actually made such a good movie as "american graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for bill norton.

like a lot of people, i loved the original; "american graffiti" was one of the great movies of the 70s. the sequel, "more american graffiti" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. it wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as "laurie's" character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and "terry the toad" and "pharaoh joe" somehow managing to serve together in vietnam). they even have a police officer by the name of "falfa" (harrison ford's character in the original) who makes a "cameo". he doesn't even look like harrison ford, who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage.the operative word here is "funny". this movie isn't even amusing. debbie (candy clark) is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope spoking hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail; steve and laurie (ron howard and cindy williams), the lovebirds in the original, have two kids and have become an annoying, bickering couple; adorable little tomboy carol (mackenzie phillips) has become "rainbow", yet another hippie child. john milner (paul lemat) is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original. even wolfman jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original, and gave it such a great flow, only is heard sporadically.perhaps it was different writers, a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure.the episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel. it was a movie that didn't need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie "american graffiti" was and avoid the movie with "more" in the title.

as with many sequels, this one just doesn't have the quality or the impact of the original. the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats. this one just doesn't cut it. the first film had a magical "good time" feeling about it that is totally missing from this film. we became enamored of all these characters (minus richard dreyfuss) in an age of innocence. now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. while this is what happens in real life, we don't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters! the film doesn't have the humor that the original had, and we were expecting to laugh. what little humor is there is dark. the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever, while this one is good but not even close to the original's. this film is so totally different from the original that it isn't even actually a sequel. i gave it a 4.

the final frames of the original "american graffiti" provide one-line summaries of the fates of the film's four central male characters. while somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters, the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want. however, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended. bad move. making an insurance salesman and his wife, a nerdy private in vietnam, a drag race driver, and a overgrown hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie. while most of the original cast is back, with only richard dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "more american graffiti" is a mess of silly situations that involve protests, car races, country singers, and the vietnam war. the use of split screens, once thought innovative and daring, is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one. this is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel. perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson. even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, is poorly done here. if you want more "american graffiti," see the original twice.

the trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there's little middle ground. putting it gently, this is not "berlin - symphony of a city" or "man with a movie camera". unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either.the problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if michael moore had come on board. it doesn't really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis. this is just a patchwork in search of a point. (though, quite inadvertently, the movie tells us more about the mind of uncle sam than it intends. there is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilisation, anti-media movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology. 'do as i say, and not as i do'. you just gotta love the yanks, eh.) tonally, there's something sour and misanthropic about this episode. both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration; this time the tone is consistently glum. it simply doesn't work over this duration, as gustav mahler will tell you.stylistically, naqoyqatsi is a mess. the whizzy digital stuff is particularly misguided. it gives the whole thing a totally fussy, overprocessed look, and it also undermines the 'realist' nature of the analogue 'found footage'. (i mean, i pity the guys. part of the joy of koyanisqaatsi was that it was a homage to the use of optical film. but now optical film's an historical artifact, they have to 'take on board' the digital domain; but i don't think they bring it off. the digital stuff often looks like video links from cnn or bbc world.) and with the "found footage", well, the digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly, and the false colour and solarisation kept me thinking of......ahem...james bond title sequences.ahem. odd as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by yo yo ma's performance; it's about as unobtrusive as a lawrence olivier voice-over. the images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma.philip glass himself is on odd form; never expected him to knock off the verdi requiem! (made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired response to any part of this movie). there's even one piece of music that sounds like brahms. (?) perhaps they've changed his pills.from our 'idle questions' department: is geoffrey reggio actually a hopi indian at all? or did he just do a sweatlodge in hollywood hills? oh, and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier 'episodes' in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies, too, are part of the global media slushy?

koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film i've ever seen. it's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. this is exactly what's happening here. the camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. there is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. the music is disturbing. just as i rated koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst. it's a "pure" movie, too, but this is the negative form, exactly that which should *not* be done.

dear reader, watch out! this movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the impertinence to call it so. if you have not been warned about its content, here it goes: the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling, concept. they could be called, therefore, symbols. the images are accompanied by a soundtrack, it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well. however, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, american icons. though the film is intended to express the idea of "civilized warfare", it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is far too long and tiresome, and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with "war", in whichever conception. to conclude, i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary, a movie which is not a movie, a "something" whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.

what i hoped for (or even expected) was the well known "stop motion" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. in short: the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. the stuff that made the other qatsi's hits.i just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.having watched the movie i got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping. that's fine, especially since the message is so valid. but i already knew the message, and it appeared there was nothing else left for me. more then half the film was solarized or colorized or posterized or transformed through some other filter. it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use. a lot of the images would have been prettier without the filters, like the giraffe and zebra chase. you could say that 'technology or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature' but why use these seventies effects to symbolize that? at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap looking effect i was ready to leave. the hope that the rest just couldn't be that bad made me stay. but then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames a second, then there's just not enough motion to slow down. please, record the motion-to-be-slowed faster, like was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some of) the laughing people and the drill song singing soldiers. i acknowledge that archive pictures can't be redone, but i had already seen a lot of that footage anyway, it could have done without it. it must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage, and the effects can't have been that easy to apply and arrange as well. on top of that, a lot of the work was mixed with each other. it shows that the creator wasn't out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself. but i didn't like the mixed stuff one bit... the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever, but the implementation was insufficient. the computer generated images didn't bother me that much, however out of date. the 'bits' streaming along circuits (in the first part of the film) looked more recent and were nice. mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal-mountain was less. i was pleased to hear a cello playing a major role in the music. a little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with glass' music, but that's a matter of taste. as is all of the above, of course. i do hope that there will be another qatsi story to tell soon, where computer imagery will have a less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again.

there seems to be a spectrum of cinema. on the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. in the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. on the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. such is the case with naqoyqatsi.i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised. a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along. none of us knew what to expect, and by the end, none of us were pleased.yes, there are breathtaking images. yes, i'm amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage. yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, and probably the best part of the experience. the thing is, this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole.it's preachy. it's a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality. it's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way. it's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even figure out what it's saying).this movie is simply art for art's sake. an attempt to say "look at how deep and thought-provoking we can be by using montage!" when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self-gratification.

i was very disappointed in this film. the director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. there may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.i would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. as i watched it, i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. at the end of the movie i was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way. i could only say to myself, "what was that?"there were a few really striking parts of the film, but not enough to warrant sitting through it again.

the peace and beauty of koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world. in naqoyqatsi, we are assaulted by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent, and the digital -- the destructive constructs of our culture.some liberties are taken with the images, with posterization, distressing, and much slow motion. the connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if there are any. naqoyqatsi is defined at the film's end, a missed opportunity to place the images in context.the film is difficult to watch, the quality of the archival footage uneven, and it's most redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of philip glass.

koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. they got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. the executive producer puts his own image in the film... its just pretentious. maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but godfrey reggio the director of koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi directed this. i'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film. you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together.

the first two movies of this series excelled for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society. this movie doesn't have any of that natural footage, which i understand is part of the point, but it really makes the entire video component of the film seem like random images stuck together-- ones and zeroes flying around, computer models of human skeletons, and so forth. occasionally the stock footage is put to good effect (the nationalism/finance segment around 35:00), but usually it makes the video appear to lack any meaningful content, and demands you accept the context of the stock photographers rather than the context of the director. it's no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. three stars added for the philip glass soundtrack.

please?! if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, i think i missed his entire point. because i walked out feeling like reggio relied on cold-war-era footage of space exploration, and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology. trails of 1 and 0, denoting technology and math and science -- done that. anyone out there see the matrix? and motion studies of people in motion? ever heard of edward muybridge? at least he uses exact clips of muybridge's photographs of human motion studies.this film was derivative, and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he's done in the past 10 years... avoid this film at all costs!!

the director godfrey reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two qatsi films, is hopelessly jumbled here. athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laughing heads, etc, mingle without purpose. the parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from getty images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable. surely someone involved (steven soderbergh, executive producer?) could have pointed out that applying a solarizing filter to nearly every frame was a very bad idea? the crude looping, layering, and distorting of images recalls a freshman photoshop class. and to make matters worse, the computer animation sequences are more artless than a 1980's wall street pie-chart. this is not to say that improved aesthetics alone would have salvaged this film, but some meager effort in this direction may have made it tolerable as visual fodder for the accompanying music. i feel compelled to point out that the score by philip glass will certainly satisfy his fans. not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of what glass does best with lovely violin contributions by yo yo ma. if you decide to see this film be certain to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence. while you may already be familiar with detroit's once majestic but long abandoned michigan central railroad station 89 minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of 20th century decay as the critical point when you should have headed for the exit sign/hit the stop button, etc. you've been warned.

i've seen all 3 now. i just can't believe how bad naqoyqatsi is. not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. i can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. i gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. they were thought provoking and beautifully done. i gave this movie a rating of 1. if a 0 or negative number was available, i would have given it that rating instead. what a total waste of time it was watching this movie. i thought after the first 30 minutes that i should turn it off, but then i figured that it was just a (very) slow starting movie. i thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. then i realized that it wasn't going to get any better.it's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities. don't take my word for it, watch it yourself. be sure to see the first two movies before this one. if you see this one first, i can just about guarantee that you'll never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "piece of work".the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end. that's when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering that you've endured watching this "film". if god is truely merciful, he'll be more generous.

having enjoyed koyaanisqatsi and powaqatsi i was looking forward to this third part of the qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. although it tries to represent "civilised warfare" in the form of sport, science, trade and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. war is chaos, but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme. on the plus side, it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars.naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times i had to remind myself that i was not watching an advertisement promoting the american way of life. perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "war on terror". when representing "sport as war" the prominent team logos ensured that the usa was depicted as the winner. hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilised warfare.apart from newsreel, the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of new york and there was little recognition of "life as war" in the rest of the world. the gallery of faces (waxworks) gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the usa. the makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean americanisation.the philip glass soundtrack sounded much like every other philip glass score i've heard (with the possible exception of koyaanisqatsi) and at best can be described as "inoffensive" neither adding to, nor detracting from, the chaotic imagery.

i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. i really, really wish i had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. maybe my expectations were too high, but i felt let down.the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh. it was good enough, though, that i'll still probably check out the soundtrack.but just keep this in mind if you see this film: if you come to realize at any point that you're not enjoying it, go ahead and split - you won't miss a thing, because it won't get any better.i'll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people's wax dummies (wtf were they thinking here?!?), some giggling babies (cuuuuute), some "bitchin'" photoshop effects, some imagery that's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water, information, money and people (i think)... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence... and then a bunch of stock space footage.i could remake this movie in 10 seconds. here's my pitch:2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string; 5 seconds of that scene in "network" where the guy talks about messing with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows in, money flows out;" 1 second of reginald denny getting brained with a brick, and then 3 seconds of alan bean bouncing around on the moon. there you go - that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved. of course, i'd get a copy of after effects and apply a filter or two, so it wouldn't look as blatantly stock as it is. if steven soderbergh's reading this, hey, i won't even need much money for this project...if you insist upon watching a movie about "life as war," i suggest "bowling for columbine" instead. it may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it's funny.

this is a failure so complete as to make me angry.all of the subtlety and structure of reggio's early films is gone, leaving nothing but a hash of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do. just how do star trek-like wormhole graphics, slo-mo colorized seascapes, mutiplicities of obviously fake computer icons, and shots of athletic competition that, incidentally, show that no one has ever been able to top (or even match) leni riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion, edited together with an overlay of video colorization that a 1980s "dr. who" producer would have rejected as "too cheesy," add up to a polemic against "civilized violence"? there is no intellectual, emotional, or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by reggio and way too many digital effects artistes, and the cautionary tale i assume he wanted to produce. with all of the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something new.only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that it's meaningful; this is kindergarten stan brakhage, and ultimately gutless in its relentless obviousness. the only irony and tension evident here (unlike in "koyaanisqatsi" where the relentless beauty and strangeness of time-altered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning) was when the dvd i was watching jammed and skipped. this is mtv for the noam chomsky crowd, based on reflex rather than reflection and signifying nothing. two stars for the music, which is in glass's best pomo-cesar franck style and features some passionate cello from yo-yo ma. (i hope for his sake that he didn't have to record his parts to a playback of the film; there are some things you shouldn't have to do even for a paycheck.)

what a disappointment! i've enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone, but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone. in the books he's a city detective, who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in fisticuffs. for the film the character has been spiced up, into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl, though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him i don't know; taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy.but his character's stamina is remarkable; he flies in from australia, apparently goes straight to the commissioner's house (rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black-tie reception), saves him from assassination (getting into a fight in the process), goes to a casino with one girl, leaves with another and takes her to bed. so much for jet lag! on the way back to the commissioner's house (showing a good knowledge of london back streets), he gets beaten up by the baddies, but is still first down to breakfast! it's also remarkable that the commissioner's limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock-activated bomb.the best thing is joseph the butler's disdain for the uncouth malone. and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue, though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week.

if any movie ever made italians look bad, this is it.duke mitchell - what an a--hole. duke mitchell, i s--t on your grave. seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the ku klux klan or skinheads. awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right? wrong. typical softheaded sentimental tripe.while i do understand why some people might be struck by and even, to a certain extent, admire the film's audacious, totally un-pc verve (it's certainly unashamed of its own hatefulness and sense of self-involvement), but this doesn't change the fact that the main character, mimi (and, by extension, duke mitchell), is thoroughly loathsome human being who earns not one iota of empathy or interest, especially given that duke mitchell is such a complete bore as a performer. but what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (apart from this dog t--d of a movie) was being a second rate dean martin imitator?

that is the answer. the question is: what is the single reason to watch this movie? i loved her in "my name is julia ross." that is one of the best films noir of all time. noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.she is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. that would be "the guilt of janet ames." this one has a spooky, promising title. it has a good cast. it has a fine director. i was expecting something dark. maybe something a little tawdry. instead, it's an uninspired, routine espionage movie. it's pretty much is a total bore. at least it was to me. ms. foch is captivating. and that is about it.

we've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like budd boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june 25, 1945.the war on europe was over for almost two months, of course not even harry cohn could control the events of history. so i'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese. another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater. the cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the oss in that part of the world.when you're an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina foch. he's about to go on a mission to the orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in china against the japanese occupation. germans who've been bugging otto kruger's house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who've already lost the war trying to help their allies. who, by the way, they refer to as 'japs'. when foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about wright's danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge. she goes there and foils the plot. all the stuff you'd expect from a nice noir film is there, the foggy atmosphere of san francisco, the dimly lit sets, budd boetticher tried his best as did the cast. but they just weren't convincing, probably because they didn't believe this claptrap themselves.it's possible, but not likely that nina foch's dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor. i think it was just a lousy screenplay. and budd and harry cohn at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here.

a tedious effort from not-yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress nina foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie. it's just not the good kind. and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.basic plot -- nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before. meanwhile, it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy, and is about to go on an-extra secret, hush-hush mission that must not fail.of course, there are nazis. and plot holes. and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes, so that the running time can be spun out past an hour. at the end, the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly. if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew, we'd have lost the war in '42.the movie itself is rather flatly shot (despite the best efforts of the fog machine) and the acting -- as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately -- is curiously unengaged. it's less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie, but also less fun to watch.boetticher's strength, of course, is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore. maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule.

this version of "the magic flute" is not only the worst production of mozart's great opera that i have ever seen, it is also the worst video production i have seen of any opera.i'm a big opera fan and i have more opera on dvd than movies. the sets are cheap and cheesy. papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. he is just dressed like some guy. the sound is in mono. the color is really bad. it is saturated in orange. most dvd's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one. also, the language has been changed to swedish instead of the original german.this is not a movie version of "the magic flute." it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well. you can pick any other available dvd of this opera and i guarantee it will be better than this one. my preference is for the version conducted by james levine with sets by david hockney.

the positives: it's shot pretty well. has some interesting peripheral characters. likable main character (albeit weak).the bad: plot/story. editing. characters wasted. jessica alba.i'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. i don't understand how anyone can hand over $12m to this guy jenkin. and before i go any further, i just want to say that i don't dislike jessica alba--i really wanted to like her in this film. however, jessica alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable. she has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she ruins every scene she's in. needless to say, the romance does not come off as believable(not even a tiny bit).all i saw throughout was the actors flapping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were given--but sadly, all this movie does is sink. there is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing is gained. it's a pretty empty movie.

great book, poorly done movie. cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category. no doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong the very talented gretchen mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. feels like everyone just phoned it in. even the makeup (mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude. don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book.

this was the first chan film made by monogram. what a come down from fox values and standards! i was shocked when i saw my first monogram after seeing the great fox films. this is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as chan calmly walks across the street. chan is now working for the us secret service rather than the honolulu police department. he is assisted by benson fong, who plays no. 3 son tommy for the first time. he also has a daughter along, iris chan, played by marianne quon. mantan moreland also makes his debut as birmingham brown. he is a cab driver in washington, dc, here, rather than the later chauffeur to chan in the later films.

i quite enjoyed the wrecking crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being urban menace (1999) which i've yet to see). i know it was baaaaad, but the three leads did a pretty decent job, all things considered.this, however, was truly atrocious. ice-t was dreadful, and he's the producer! can't say i've ever heard of silkk the shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell), but his performance was one of the worst i've ever seen in a movie.miss jones did pretty well in her small role, though she later went on to make some atrocious, racist "jokes" on her radio show after the se asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly). way to go, girl...no-one else comes out with any credit. strangely, tj storm and ernie hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are far better in the wrecking crew, which was made, along with urban menace, at the same time as corrupt. how that works, i don't know.i'm going to try the ice-t commentary now, to see whether he apologises for the film, or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film-making.

the most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in ice-t's acting. the story-line; two rival gangs having to fight it out, with the sub-plots of betrayal, power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through. the decrepit scenery, which added slight believability in places, and questionable lighting, constantly distracted from any interest/identification with the characters (the shine off of the actress's forehead/nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen. a disappointment if you have seen ice-t in other roles. kudos to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.

i'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season, from the b grade to the hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasn't to good, compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz (quite good) and ice-t in new jack and svu (great). the scene where corrupt (ice-t) kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice-t and the other dude, this kills the jamaican, however ice-t is unharmed, very similar to ice's other movie urban menace (which stars both of these actors) were snoops character is supernatural, however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon. when mj (silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-with out blood. and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird, benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film. it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head. wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters mj and lisa. the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide-was a good part of the film, even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him. the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. it was ok tho. but me being from poverty i love hood films, however if u don't love em like i do don't watch it. only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars, and my love of the genre.nathaniel purez

seriously, i can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. how many methamphetamines was bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought? the dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a "screwball" comedy, and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing i've ever heard. the cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-tv movies, the acting is awful (although i get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director), and speaking of which, did i mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? the whole thing is a terribly unfunny (even in the much-beleaguered world of so-bad-it's-funny clunkers), soul-sucking, waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back. be afraid, be very afraid...

wow, this movie sucked.this movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlot.everything about this movie was awful.the acting was horrendous. every part except the part of the 'mexican' sandlot manager was terrible.luke perry, though only bit parts was absolutely awful. this was is worst role ever. even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch, even in the end, lol.this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage. the humor was for 6 year olds.if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch, skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead.

the calu-what now? yeah, i thought it was a stupid name as well. chris carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. starting off with the usual cheery x-files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well i can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever. are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them? don't ask me. not only is it boring and un-scary, but it's like watching a really bad omen sequel with overblown and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (although to be brutally honest, that's the least of my worries). sara b. charno began her x-files career with a whimper and thankfully ended it with one as well.verdict: in the words of my maths teacher mr. laverack: "horrible, awful..."

i admit - i was lured to this one from the hype - and i didn't stop to consider the sources. "one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)", shocking", and " a must have ".well - i wasted my money. but not all was bad in this movie. they at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. there is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.but for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting. we get gay sex - sorta. we have 3 inter-racial babes - maybe. we have a psychotic vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok that made me wince) and some female version of gene simmons (i don't get that part). we have an honest to goodness capone - rates among the best of the actors in this film - that is not a compliment. and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to - i don't know - try to connect the vengeance/random/theme killing by jimmy boy to make the vietnamese psycho seem sane??????? if nothing else this movie proves that the italians and the americans do not have a lock on this type of movie. the latinos can make crap as well as the rest of them. kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that overcame it and made a career for themselves.

i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. the sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat. the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released, as large portions of the film don't have any music at all. camera-work can best be described as a gnarled mess, with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way, absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene, they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand. if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads, well, so be it. editing is just a butcher job; everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible, nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word. i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder, i tend to think it was the latter. i only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off, i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore. it's like a ninth grade audio-visual class project.

we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set, under the title "the broken skull." shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, "evil dead" kind of way.without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. while there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying "hunh?"this is a very, very gory movie. the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly video toaster effect that has to be freeze-framed to be (dis)believed. the "fangoria" level of gross-out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore-hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side.the broken skull is also an extremely noisy movie. it features not only ambient noises (captured by mikes and not replaced in post), but there is a lot of shrieking. no, no, i mean a lot. a lot, a lot! characters scream, wail, howl and yell, chitter and laugh maniacally. turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves! but you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining. in particular, the actress playing a certain vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto.in fact, very few of the actors were wooden. some of them may have overacted a bit (oh, just a wee smidgen!), but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off. the cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that. the two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most spiteful, exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the mst3k classic "the brute man." just watch them seethe at all the other characters, it's fun!in closing, the headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with jason voorhees, michael myers or freddy kruger (or even the leprechaun), but we can definitely say this ... this was a movie.

i got this for my birthday in a box set under the name broke skull. well, after watching one on the dvd and being pleasantly surprised, i popped this sucker in. it was worse than i had expected, and i didn't expect much. this movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. there was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were? i saw a bad effect of a head being crushed, brain tissue (or something...), and blood coming from the penis area two times. i have to say the the part were the guy gets his man hood bitten off made me squirm, that was the only good thing about this movie. and that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason. the acting in this was atrocious, really, it blew. that asian chick was annoying, then the annoying mexican boyfriend who comes in to just be killed. i say if you get this in a box set, that is fine, but don't spend any money on it, at all.

lowe returns to the nest after, yet another, failed relationship, to find he's been assigned to jury duty. it's in the plans to, somehow, get out of it, when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade.through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl (played by camp), lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear camp of attempted murder, while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time, and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time.i've heard that st augustine is the oldest city in the us, and i also know it has some ties to ponce de leon, so the backdrop is a good place to start. unfortunately, it's the only thing good about this movie. the local police are inept, the judge is an idiot, and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like joanie cunningham! i don't know whether to blame the director for poor direction, or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effort.in short, this movie was so boring, i could not even sleep through it! 1 out of 10 stars!

the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal, dramatic character. well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film. in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that pete's meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama. and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot. one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen. i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign. the characters are not much better than a story. despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him. it doesn't work. the same thing with other characters. they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although he wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot. towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity. unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and i'm sure he had) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a weird script. grade: 3 out of 10. those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed.

too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut. this film looks like it was put together by a committee that couldn't decide if it was a comedy, drama, suspense, or sci-fi. it starts out sort of playful, then quickly gets darker, and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something. it's totally weird and impossible to string together. the acting is extremely uneven, with the older professionals engaging your attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play. this movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first-run and art houses. this would be a good film for a film class to analyze. plot, character, theme, consistency - they are all either faulty or missing from this film.

never ever take a film just for its good looking title.although it all starts well, the film suffers the same imperfections you see in b-films. its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film, so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious.a film to be listed on top of the garbage list.

four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly, it stars carly pope (of "popular" fame), who is always a pleasure to watch. secdonly, it features brilliant new zealand actress rena owen. thirdly, it is filmed in association with the new zealand film commission. fourthly, a friend recommended it to me. however, i was utterly disappointed. the whole storyline is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. pope's acting is fine, but owen is unfortunately under-used. the other actors and actresses are all okay, but i am unfamiliar with them all. aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and pope and owen), this film isn't very good. so the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to.
