this movie seems a little clunky around the edges, like not quite enough zaniness was thrown it when it should have been. but i mostly enjoyed it.the storyline is more than a little bit preposterous, so no expectation of "something real" should be included in your viewing experience. check your brain in at the door. it will not be needed and might be an impediment otherwise.i quite enjoyed clennon's performance as the real dr. baird. his role was spot on for giving aykroyd's character a protagonist. what a putz the real dr. baird was.and matthau was quite good as the lead character's sidekick. annoying at first, but ultimately lovable. sort of. kind of. or at least something the use of a bar of soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpful.actually worth watching? if you're in the mood for a spoof on the psychiatric profession, sure, why not.

meltdown is pretty interesting sci-fi. no major budget, very few special effects; but decent acting and a storyline of global doom is enough to sustain viewing. an asteroid grazes the atmosphere and thrust the earth into an orbit closer to the sun. global warming rapidly becomes unbearable. a determined lapd cop(casper van dien)goes all out to save the world from certain annihilation as the rising temps are devastating. the pressure is on to save mankind from this solar catastrophe; as well as protect his daughter, nurse ex-wife and tv reporter girlfriend. the cast includes: stefanie von pfetten, venus terzo, amanda crew and vincent gale.

this movie is total dumbness incarnate. yet, i've seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because, despite its sheer dumbness, it's very entertaining. and it has one of my favorite hokey-movie actors, casper van dien, who is here in his full hokey-movie glory. here, casper van dien is fully casper van dien, and ya gotta love him for it. if he hadn't been in this movie, it would have been totally unwatchable dreck, or at least far dreckier than it already is.the (cough cough) "science" used here makes absolutely no sense at all. no one else in the world noticed that big asteroid approaching the earth besides that small group? not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies for just such a thing? an asteroid that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight. and a chunk of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it? a rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous shockwaves that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the planet's surface. surely, someone would have noticed such a thing. bwahahaha! the "science" used in this movie is so completely ridiculous, that, somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it is.one thing i noticed is that despite the uber heat, all the characters weren't dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked with it. at the most, the characters looked like they had been lightly spritzed on occasion by someone off-camera with a water bottle to give a "sweat sheen". authenticity was *not* a goal that this movie assiduously and constantly strived for. which, in a weird and hilarious sort of way, gives this movie its entertainment charm.is this movie actually worth watching? definitely! assuming, of course, you have absolutely *no* expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality. and, it's your desire to wallow and luxuriate in total hokeyness at the moment.

meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system developed to deflect asteroids should they be on a collision course with earth. nathan (vincent gale) mentions some misgivings to his, but the test appears to be an unqualified success. then the asteroid breaks apart, and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with earth. fortunately, the huge rock skips off of earth's outer atmosphere and ricochets into space. unfortunately, the glancing blow is just enough to alter earth's orbit, and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sun.while all of this is going on above their heads, los angeles cops tom (casper van dien) and mick (greg anderson) are on a stake-out. they're supposed to collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they're watching quickly devolves into a shooting match. afterward, tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter who also happens to be his girlfriend, carly (stefanie von pfetten).at a nearby hospital where mick is treated for a minor injury, tom has a brief chat with his ex-girlfriend bonnie (venus terzo), who is a nurse. he tells her he's concerned about the fact that their 17 year-old daughter kimberly (amanda crew) is dating a man named cj (ryan mcdonell). once tom explains to bonnie that he's discovered cj has a criminal record, she's a little worried herself.it's not long, however, before everybody has something else to worry about. the temperature is rapidly rising all around the world. carly is one of the first non-scientists to learn what's really happening. nathan, who is her brother, calls her to say he may have a way that they can survive. carly calls tom; he, of course, promptly contacts bonnie.in relatively short order, the motley group is on the road. before they can reach their ultimate goal, however, they've got to make their way through bands of looters, deal with a catastrophic water shortage, and manage to travel in temperatures that are high enough to kill.casper van dien is a good looking guy, and i actually enjoyed him in starship troopers. that may be because he's good in action scenes. it might also be because he didn't talk much in that movie. in meltdown, he's unfortunately given just enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to showcase his entirely average acting abilities. amanda crew is also okay, and ryan mcdonell isn't bad, either. vincent gale and stefanie von pfetten are also both reasonably good, but venus terzo is sadly on a par with van dien.what really makes or breaks a movie, though, is the story and the script. while the story here is okay and actually has some real potential, the script is just awful. the science part of the science fiction is non-existent starting with the asteroid pushing the earth out of orbit and escalating with the notion that the "gravitational balance of the solar system" might "pull the earth back" into its usual orbit "over time." when the temperature in la hits 120 degrees, cars start blowing up.you know what's even worse than the bad science? the bad continuity. okay, really hot. why are people in the movie not only wearing long sleeved shirts, but jackets, too? why are people mugging each other for bottled water instead of turning on the taps at home? why are the streets completely empty, but the freeways completely full? and why are the freeways full of unexploded? it's almost superfluous to note that the sets, costumes, and production values were good, especially when that only forces me to say that the edits were not.so basically, you take a pretty good story idea and combine it with mostly mediocre acting, a terrible script, low-end special effects, utterly irrational plot twists, and poor edits, and what do you have? a movie that's even less than the sum of its inconsiderable parts. i'm sorry to say that i can't recommend meltdown: days of destruction to anyone.political notes: there is mention here that congress finally loosened the purse strings enough to fund the tests that start the movie rolling. while the tests here were wholly irresponsible (targeting an asteroid with a nuke and not knowing the composition of the big rock is, in fact, well beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane), the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet. unfortunately, we've tracked nowhere near all of the near earth asteroids that could be worrisome in some orbit some day; and our ability to spot something on a collision course with us is limited at best.once we do discover we're going to be hit, we quite literally have no system in place to deal with it. there are no nuclear-tipped space missiles we can launch; the space shuttle is completely incapable of going beyond earth orbit, and if it were, we couldn't launch enough of them or launch them quickly enough for it to matter. i'm not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but i certainly think protecting the planet from destruction coming at us from outer space could be construed as defending the country, don't you? family suitability: meltdown: days of destruction is rated r for "some violence." i frankly didn't find the violence here anything beyond a fairly typical t-rated video game. if your teens are keen on seeing meltdown and you can't talk them out of it, the r-rating shouldn't dissuade you from letting them see it. it's not, however, a good idea to leave the younger kids in the room with their elder siblings. while the shootings aren't too graphic in the main, some of the dead bodies are.

yeah it may not be for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you don't think about it it's really not that bad.the story has alvin and his gang, going across the world, in search of jewels for a bad person, and the misadventures that they come in contact with.so the animation is good, and the story is cute, and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie.i give it a 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars.

okay, first the good thing : if you saw the trailer then you know about 100% of the "scary/jumpy" moment of the movie. and yes, it's a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the movie.i now understand why sarah michelle gellar did not stay alive in that movie for very long, she did not want to associate her name with this production. i wish her the best for "the return".you have to follow 3 different story in this movie, and they are all disconnected (in time and meaning) until the very end. and even then it's a very bad climax. and god forbid even open the door to another sequel.yes, in this movie, "the rage and fury" is on the move. no need to visit the house anymore, just be close to someone who when inside and you're done. it's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus. go inside the house, get scared, return back to usa and spread the joy in your apartment building.it's not that difficult to follow, but you just don't really care about anyone. the plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head... milk anyone?? i saw ju-on 2 at the fantasia movie festival last summer, different story completely but much better than this dud. it's not a remake, but this time, maybe they should have simply done a remake....if you must see it, wait for the dvd.

very strange. but meant to be. this director is his own man. even through there are strains if polanski, bergman, and kafka at least in the episode no 6, the peeping tom one. what made it all so strange, and reminiscent of the above three artists, was that it went all over the place, you never knew where it was headed, and could have ended anyplace, and finally when it did end, could have kept going. the ending is hardly a finality, nobody could tell you what these two characters would be doing in even the next frame. one other thing should be said about the director: no wonder kubrick found him fascinating. there is a lot of eyes wide shut in this episode somehow, in the direct approach to character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. a kubrick placement of the camera without any of the stark effects, much more washed out, and hurried, not as fussed over. that said, back to the beginning, still this guy has his own things to say and says them well. yet, for some reason, there is not a single scene i ever want to see again. but definitely did not feel ripped off in the least watching it one time around. but i did keep getting the feeling of three or four other directors ghosts moving through the parade, blurring everything. the caveat being that it was only episode six: the other nine might give me entirely different takes. but since this episode revolved around peeping, looking, the absolute domain of film, i will say this, he took none of the usual routes, definitely went his own way while carrying the baggage of a lot of good directors behind him.

i think we are supposed to think what wonderful salt-of-the-earth characters. unfortunately, this is lame and laboured.as always with any production set in newcastle, there are numerous shots of the tyne bridge and frequent attempts to show what great 'characters' geordies are. the viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is set, as though the rest of the world cared about newcastle and its inhabitants.if you like well observed, literate and original work stay well clear.

two teenagers in the north-east of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team. they go through a series of "comic misadventures" but come up smiling in the end.the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light-hearted moments. however, the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes. the two "heroes" have no problems with lying, cheating and stealing. their adversaries are a callous teacher, a pantomime villain of a father, a psychotic skinhead and a well-meaning but incompetent social worker. the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager, a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death. there are no likable characters, and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt. local actors tim healy and kevin whateley both play against type as baddies, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have no more than novelty value.chris beattie and greg mclane give good performances in the two young leads. however, they are miscast, because they have the wrong accent. to anyone from the north east, it is obvious that they both come from the sunderland/durham area, and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of newcastle. as a geordie myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same. take the phrase "let the poor lad speak". we say "let the pooa lad speek" while they say "piwer lad spiyk", with two distinctly different vowel sounds. this discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in sunderland football ground, where the two lads are trying to disguise the newcastle accents they don't have, and *pretend* that they come from sunderland - which they clearly do. in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nit-picking. however, the film's bleak tone makes it clear that writer/director mark herman is aiming for gritty realism: that means "near enough" is actually way off.i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film, and instead found tired old clichés. tyneside is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers, and in telling us it is, herman should have known he would cause offence. it's interesting to compare the film with the same director's "little voice" - also largely downbeat and populated by one-dimensional characters, "little voice" at least has a talented heroine and doesn't wallow in misery to the same extent. i've heard "belter" ranked alongside this year's "billy elliot", but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life-affirming experience.incidentally, i may be just too old, but having lived on tyneside for 42 years, i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression "purely belter".
