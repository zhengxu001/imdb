i was looking forward to this movie. trustworthy actors, interesting plot. great atmosphere then ????? if you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. first. know it. ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-which! they almost did. things i didn't get. a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences. great riddles that fell by the wayside. the promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal. i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. what? run out of ideas! such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly. it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road

i gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress, in this film it's carly pope, behaving like a ditz, don't bother.carly pope plays sara novak, a young college student, who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles, that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.there are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop, and a woman named emily gray, who is back in prison.sara's father is a lawyer who is handling emily gray's case. a few years back, emily gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again, even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.the only explanation emily has ever given for her crime is: i never sinned.it's all part of the design.well, my friend, don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that, because you won't.

like a lot of the comments above me, also i though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. i found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.but that is not the only comment. the scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as i will explain a in a few moments). (the next sentence is a small spoiler.) the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking. in the worst case, the other party is represented by one person.also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters (i mean, from a point of the interviewed, 'akward'). moreover the interview persons always stay calm, they say everything without normal emotions. i.e. you cannot tell whether they lie or not, are mad or not. they show almost nothing.this is also very unprofessional, the 'christian' reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview.bottom line:all conversations contain:- facts- pro/con argumentsthere are no lies. nobody lies. (the next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you still plan to see the movie) the only lie happening is to demonstrate how 'bad' non-believers are.this makes me conclude that the movie is a b-movie. it is very similar to 'plan 9 from outer space' (from the 50's), but this movie also has an annoying, wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief.note: i have no intention to insult christians, people who believe in aliens or whomever else. this is a thought i have about the movie, not about people.moreover i would like to note that i don't know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts.

this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i've seen in a long time.it's marketed as as sci-fi when in fact it's nothing more than a christian recruiting tool.it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers. let's not forget, our bumbling former president actually came out and said that "god told him" to invade iraq. and nobody questioned if he was hearing voices, or seeing things? anyway, going of the subject here. no this movie has nothing to do with ufos whatsoever, it's nothing more than a religious production.

as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church ! anyway, movie had a good b movie sci-fi beginning, everything was there to make a good entertaining , easy to watch movie, then everything felt in this religious jesus-will-save-everyone brainwashing mode.story start with 2 main characters, 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con-descendant attitude.in a few words: this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minuteswaste of time, waste of money... avoid it

ok, this movie, was the worst display i have seen in years. the actors weren't to bad (i figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). anyways, i watched this movie, thinking, oh cool a ufo sci-fi movie. wrong. it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people. the last scene was extremely messed up. that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. what someone believe in is a matter of opinion. this movie just shows how corrupted religion is, especially christianity.if you want to watch a b-movie, this ain't. if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses. well this is the pick of the litter. go right for it. if you are going to convey a message, do it, don't force it. ridiculous, that people would abuse the media to such a degree. especially, christians.

i of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other lion's gate extravaganza, so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. and it is, to a point. a young college student (sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them, and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game. now that's fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. all of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's "all part of the design". in reality, it's all part of the "very sketchy script" and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time, like cleaning the bathroom, for instance. 4 out of 10.

i have yet to watch starcrash (1979) - that notoriously cheesy italian take on star wars (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which, suffice it to say, makes mel brooks' so-so spaceballs (1987) look like a veritable work of art! in fact, the main reason why galaxina is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - playboy centerfold dorothy stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! although statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by jamie lee curtis and mariel hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or other; in fact, galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the blue star (cue choral music) once they land! having said that, statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either.still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying captain cornelius butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here), a long-eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. the villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the blue star, exclaims, "what is this s**t?" there is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive hollywood veteran, angelo rossitto!for what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include skin and tonic, scotsman on the rocks, thigh pies, baked alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the harley davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their "lord". god(awful) indeed...

this picture hit the movie screens on june 6th 1980, starring stephen macht as sergeant thor, avery schreiber as captain comelius butt, j.d. hinton as buzz and starring playmate of the year dorothy stratton. the picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for i guess criminals. there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. enters sergeant thor and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. when failing they call on captain comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. enters the gorgeous dorothy stratton, who plays the role of galaxina who is man made robot. an now a few thoughts on this picture. this movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that i don't get into sci-fi. if you're into sci-fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci-fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci-fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled star trek. now for the reason that i bought this movie, dorothy stratton. she is gorgeous in her one piece suit. i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. connie sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. on the picture alone i give this movie 1 weasel star and on dorothy stratton i give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon.com

for connoisseurs of bad movies, galaxina is a true gem. with truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. in particular, the scenes involving the harley davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.sadly, the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!

... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have galaxina.this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction. this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek. unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (i say obviously, because i hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.i missed it when it came out in 1980.) here's the underlying problem. dorothy stratton couldn't act, so for most of the movie, they didn't even let her try. i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me i can't understand why.clearly, the movie tried to spoof star wars, star trek and aliens, but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something, it has to be funny! this movie wasn't, or at least, the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't. science fiction is ripe for parody, as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved. this movie, however, did it poorly.

dorothy stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci-fi spoof, and her appearance is a disappointment. though she has the title role, her screentime is limited, and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue. if you're not a stratten fan, pass this one up.

yesterday i watched this tv production, and i was very disappointed.i didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. i felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the "turn off"-switch.the movie is about a doctor (dr. verghese) who gets a lot of aids-patients, and most of them die during the movie. it is hard for verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations. however this movie has problems showing both sides, it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients, and sometimes we see flicks from his home, but we don't get much. the difficulties to show more than one part of verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from naveen andrews, a man i (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies.i believe it got 7,6 because of the subject (taboo?), but i'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market. stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10.

is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? there's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period! i can't believe there's even a sequel to this!1

i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies. but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had tails. it's a stinker of epic proportions. what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. the comedy is extremely weak. i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art. and there's just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together. it seems to drag on and on and on.well, you may be asking yourself, "if it's as bad as you say, why haven't you rated it lower than a 3/10?" good question! and i've got two answers. first, the movie is not without its curiosity value. i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years b.c. with raquel welch. i'll give when women had tails a point for its historic "value". the other two points are for the mere presence of senta berger. i know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? it's the best i can come up with.

way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. these cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. this film tells of the "hilarious" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage. along the way we get such "great" moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach. a monkey throwing rocks at their heads. a man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. the obligatory "gay" caveman. the list could go on and on. this movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck. i was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen bobbled around hitting each other, making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch, hitting each other, and mauling poor seta berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense. she is indeed one of two bright spots in this film. she isn't much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass-et? the other "bright" spot is the music. as soon as i heard the score, i said to myself that it sounded very familiar. i had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of ennio morricone. it's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude, boring, lewd, unimaginative, and ridiculous film essentially about a group of moes finding a woman for the first time and, first wanting to eat her like some animal, being taught what she could do. awwwwh! sorry, i'm stifling a yawn as i relive the plot! the end of the film has some 100 or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a scab off your knee. this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever. the fact that it spawned a sequel doesn't surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest - tail.

i don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, ok, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. as the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: i hope that someone (tim burton, peter jackson, hayao miyazaki...) someday will direct the real neverending story. a great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it.

i saw this film before two weeks. it's kitsch, boring and totally unintelligible for people, that haven't read the original book. there are many fact mistakes too... actors plays rather poor, you must laugh even in the sad moments. it was a totally waste of time.

the girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. what i'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. the delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. and if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: they are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty louisiana mansion. that's the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths. then, two of them disappear, and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt. eureka! i just realized what one of those aforementioned "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.

this is probably the worst film i have ever seen; it makes plan 9 from outer space look wonderful. the acting is wooden, the plot silly and the sfx non-existent. the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film. the scenery is sometimes quite pretty, assuming you like trees, if that helps any!

i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h.p. lovecraft's "the lurking fear" that was shot in louisiana. outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own "twist" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. either way, it is a much better adaptation than full moon's the lurking fear. too bad it is a terrible film. director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short. i swear i counted maybe two camera movements. the creature design is cheap (we're talking store bought masks here) but shot in a dark manner (intentional or not) where they are somewhat creepy. the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well. file this one under good adaptation, poor execution.

before i really slag this film off, i just want to say i absolutely loved it. firstly, how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase "you're right."? i'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again.secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? ok, so the dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye, but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie-creatures?and finally, 'old faithful here will protect me' hahaha :)

everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. and were is all the blood and gore that was in "demons" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. the only plus in this movie was the music by "the smiths" and "the cult", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film, i haven't seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one, i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time.

some sort of accolades must be given to `hellraiser: bloodline'. it's actually out full-mooned full moon. it bears all the marks of, say, your `demonic toys' or `puppet master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? full moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. these hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. this increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish. now it's just ish.

hellraiser: bloodline is only a so-so film. i believe it's the fourth installment in the hellraiser series.i missed the beginning, and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. but, using my wit and intelligence, (and the info button) i soon found out that the villain (pinhead) was released from pandora's box, which, i believe is a gateway straight to hell.so, anyways, pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the "toymaker's" family. and, that's about it. oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. yawn.what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid, and then unleashes the dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. then he husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. who cares? why it fails is because hellraiser: bloodline is too corny to be scary. look at pinhead's minion of creatures: a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together, (siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (i haven't seen the previous films.) now look at the main villain. his name is pinhead. isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid? he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name, and a corny speech. somewhere in the film, two cops approach him and say "don't make us put some pain on you!" pinhead replies "pain? how dare you use that word! i am pain" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. it sounds a bit cliché if you ask me.don't forget the final half of the movie. the characters (and audience) get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. some person who we don't recognize (maybe he was in the previous films. i don't remember him in the beginning of the movie.) this scene is basically one thing played over and over again: a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise.some other guard: "oh no! he's down. i will go check on himby myself!"after he dies the same thing happens again.(spoilers) here's the thing i didn't get. in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end. so, how does he come back for another four films? are they prequels? why hasn't he died in the previous ones? geez. the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series. (end of spoilers) hellraiser: bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or scare value. just forget it. bad special effects with badeverything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror.good: wellsome people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning. plus, pinhead's voice is pretty cool. i suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like this too.bad: none of the reasons above make this a very good film. the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. and, who names their villain pinhead?feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.

there's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. good old alan smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by bruce ramsay) are terrorised by pinhead (doug bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick. the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's meagre running time, although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended.

in the xxii century an architect by the name of merchant (bruce ramsay) commandeers a space station, which he personally designed. as can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put merchant into custody. upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious cubical. during interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish, what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood... in order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage, about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space...the movie that is essentially the same to hellraiser, that the quickening was to highlander. something to be ignored and forgotten, as so it won't influence the lore of hellraiser to much. by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low-grade feel to it than its predecessors (who let's face it were b or c class films).acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid-budget porn-flick with wooden unbelievable performances, that actually have you thinking: so when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse? surprisingly not much sex in the movie, albeit the introduction of the seductress-demon angelique (a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of hellraiser) offers ample opportunities for the love-making.basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion. the end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film.some decent gore in the flick, but apart from that an utter failure.

i totally agree. this is "pitch black underground" and a well worn plot. the best scenes i thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. the scenery was great. had they dispensed with the staple "alien" toothy cgi badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. all they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow jack's descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material. the acting isn't bad. but those rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare.

the movie "the cave" has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there was no plot, no story-line, and the lighting was terrible. for most of the movie, i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights. the persistent 'grey' spaces throughout the movie were irksome. the only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in hell. all in all, the movie was not really worth watching. if the producers cannot come up with something better than this, they should find another occupation. the underwater scenes were particularly awful, being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with the occasional look at the actors. in summation, a really awful movie with bad lighting, extraneous flashes throughout.

i guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.this is a morons delight. the worst stereo-types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable. every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked.***spoiler*** how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place?

i've seen worse, which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was. the plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage? in a dimly-lit, smoky new york school -- and somehow this clichéd hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? are you serious? a day-long hostage situation -- with a wounded nypd officer no less, takes all day? i realize this film was made pre-9/11, but still. i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes.the acting was mediocre at best all-around, and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders. the child-abuse kid, the pregnant scared girl, the violent gang wannabe, a confused unfortunate victim, the wise-cracking white guy. please.trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? please -- this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop. they're confused, ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb -- far-fetched -- situation. don't try and paint them, suddenly, as noble, the most laughable is ziggy, who lives in the school's attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. you've got to be kidding me.the "no racism" signs in the protesting crowd? a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up. this is a random message.i understand the overall message, which was poorly portrayed, albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers.this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof? the worst scene was the kid, fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof, "promise me" etc. how original.the epilogue of "i went to prison but now i'm pre-law at xyz university" ... a fitting way to end a joke of a movie.

"crimes of passion" is a film that is disappointing on most counts. where should i start from? the plot? it is despairingly simplistic and full of gaps. the direction? reminds a cheap b-movie. the acting? john laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as "well-intentioned-husband-of-a-frozen-wife" bobby, annie pots is unconvincing as "frozen-wife" amy, and it is only kathleen turner (above average), and antony perkins (excellent) which get passable acting marks. more specifically, antony perkins gives a great performance as the pervert reverend peter shayne, while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and frail joanna crane satisfactorily.unfortunately, the performances of turner and perkins alone are insufficient to help get the film a grade higher than 4/10. watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes (although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competition-"basic instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.

if you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie (bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be), you must try this one. it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth, and you can just about smell the urine on the floor. kathleen turner struts around in a blond wig, getting her kicks from "pretending" to be a two-bit hooker (she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect), and tony perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is out to maybe murderer her (yet another movie that ends with tony perkins in drag). annie potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, which is reason enough to hate this movie. the kinky will love the sex scenes, so rent the unrated version in the red box so you can see turner give a cop a taste of his billy club (i had to pause the vcr until we stopped laughing).

ken russell directed this weird ( not very ) erotic thriller and if i hadn't known that i would have staked my life that the director was brian depalma . absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams depalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams " depalma , depalma , depalma "unfortunately since brian depalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans hitchcock over the years russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . sure an erotic thriller in the style of tommy or billion dollar brain would have been bizarre with a capital b but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . oh and anthony perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . yawn the only thing of any real note to crimes of passion is the controversy it caused . i guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity , but as for the controversial sex scenes ... what controversial sex scenes ? there aren't any and the only controversy i can think of is of china blue dominating an on duty policeman with a truncheon . needless to say he didn't come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

a few yrs ago, i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell. this theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that rozzie r. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).i thought of this essay after watching 'crimes of passion'.kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue. she's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by anthony perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading. and she won't let either of them have a piece of her until ...i won't give away the ending - but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boy's fantasy. no matter how hard ken russell tries, he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation. except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old black-and-white films look revolutionary by comparison.

the worst part of all is the poor scripting, leading to superficial acting.dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match.holly hunter's character is exaggeratedly self-centered, and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting, as usual.brad johnson was wooden. john goodman made the best of it.furthermore, the whole death / ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone, and now appears rather lame. barely watchable only if you like old aeroplanes.

this film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. why introduce rachel, for instance? she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her "follow me" truck to run wild and crash into dorinda's fence. that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a b-26 or an a-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. that serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. as it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. the ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk -- as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. here, dreyfuss just babbles on and on. the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities/impossibilities that i won't describe. what a dull and disjointed effort!

"a lot of the films i've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because i have a lot of old-fashion values." - steven spielbergsome points..1. though this film is a loose remake of "a guy named joe", it also borrows heavily from "a matter of life and death" and "wings of desire".2. this was spielberg's second attempt at being frank capra. 3. spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a "frank capra movie" in the vein of "it's a wonderful life" and "mrs smith goes to washington". judging from his recent attempts to get a "harvey" remake off the ground, it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream, the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into capracorn.4. critics at the time bashed "always", stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance, but that's really not the problem at all. the problem is that "always" needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point.5. the film is filled with comedy that just doesn't work. spielberg's comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated, and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's screwballs and looney tune cartoons. these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe, but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage.6. the film's lead couple come across as brother and sister, not lovers. spielberg's films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extreme lengths: she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man. they're more irritating than endearing.7. the film contains one good scene, in which john goodman argues with holly hunter, but for the most part the film's characters are too annoying. there's no subtlety, every emotion overplayed, every joke over designed, every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness.8. "always" and "hook" taught spielberg how to con audiences. after their failure (and the twin financial failures of "the color purple" and "empire of the sun") spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of "color purple" and "empire of the sun" in favour for the more desaturated "black and white" worlds of "schindler's list", "munich", "minority report" and "saving private ryan". from here on, "less light" and "dark cinematography" became equated with "serious topics".9. after the financial success of each "dark film" spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography, and falls flat on his face once again. "amistad" followed "schindler's list", "ai" followed "ryan" and "lincoln" will follow "munich". these "colour" films are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but the truth is, if you removed the desaturation, all these "serious" films would feel the same way.10. since the 70s, spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors (scorsese, de palma, coppola etc), by pretending to be an "optimist" and "humanist". he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s. the reality, though, is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their content, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. 11. the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in "always", and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. people running from dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, tripods, rocks etc...this is what spielberg delights in. the moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self-destructs. a film like "amistad" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.12. the film's flying scenes aren't up to the standard's set several years earlier in the mega-hit "top gun". of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to make things cinematic.13. failures like "1941", "hook", "always" etc are often more illuminating that spielberg's more successful films. they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working, revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery.5/10  there's one good sequence here (two actors in a room, simply improvising), but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script.worth one viewing.

so when bob and marion boxletter see a guy at a hotel, marion believes it is her long lost brother brian, but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face. marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after tracing his whereabouts. they get a hold of brian, but still he doesn't know what they are talking about, but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey... and even when they see joey he doesn't know them either. the plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well. experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me. personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great, but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little suspense yes but that's it.

i had to watch this movie for a film class, i suffered the whole time through. i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film. the film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (rex harrison isn't even asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians. in addition, there has been critical attention given to biography of anna. many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner. some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story. an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.

i have just caught this movie on tcm, and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him. it is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. it featured two of my favouriteplayers in eve arden (completely wasted) and dean stockwell(the best actor in the film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady frances gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical. john hodiak played his role ok, but the script let him, and the rest of the cast, down very badly. i gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography. it would have been on the first half of the program when double features were the go.

in london, the venetian carla borin (yuliya mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend matteo (jarno berardi). she meets the lesbian real estate agent moira (francesca nunzi) and rents a large apartment. when the jealous matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard (mauro lorenz) in venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. when matteo comes to london, he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior."transgredire" is another "soft porn" of the sick director tinto brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast. the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful yuliya mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is abused, touched and licked in every part of her nice body, but without showing explicit penetration. this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing yuliya mayarchuk naked in erotic situations. my vote is four.title (brazil): "a pervertida" ("the pervert")

if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as i'm concerned. this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. a good movie has to start and end strong. it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. there are so many other movies from asia to watch, many of which i am sure most of you have not seen, that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere. why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews? i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film.

this is bad movie. there is no denying it as much as i'd like to. tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality.somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be counteracted if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business, unfortunately even truly, deeply talented actors like goodman, beatty, sarsgaard, gammon, steenburgen, macdonald, pruitt taylor vince, and lest we forget mr. jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue, and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere.in fact at one point i looked up, sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was 51 minutes into it.perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story. other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture. *if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not, you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie.the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie "heaven's prisoners" starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie. i may have to watch it now, first to see if it is as bad as in the electric mist, and second because i can't seem to (no matter how hard i try) break my man crush on alec baldwin.

i have seen this movie last week during the berlin film festival and had medium-high expectations. - the director is bertrand tavernier and i was familiar with some of his previous work in french cinema. i actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies. -the cast: tommy lee jones, john goodman, peter sarsgard, mary steenburgen... i was looking forward to see all this talent on screen. -i wasn't familiar with the book it's based upon and i hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand but i was told that it was an investigation movie set in the deep south (we've seen a lot of those in the past, maybe this one's gonna be as good as the others...)2 hours later, the end titles appear: thank god it was over!!!! - the plot is beyond comprehension. if you've read the book, you have a significant advantage. there were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot arcs. we didn't understand a thing! - the accents. my god! tommy lee jones' accent is decent but i still have nightmares from mary steenburgen's cajun-french singing... - poor casting in my opinion. i can't believe old man tommy lee jones can beat the crap out of a linebacker-built goon... and i'm not afraid of john goodman. - who were these people?!? we barely understand who all these characters are and what they do. there's a bait shop? tommy lee jones has a girl from guatemala? blörg! - the comedic attempts were pathetic. the funniest thing about the movie was probably its "action" and "suspense" scenes. they were horrible. no thrills. bad acting (can tommy lee jones make different faces or is he like derek zoolander?)... - and then there's the sci-fi stuff. no spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird.i usually don't write any comments on imdb but i thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that i felt compelled to share my opinion. but that's just me...

i see that c. thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older c. thomas howell is; i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.in just a few words: what a very big disappointment. i give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a chatroom. they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat, she then insists on meeting the participant in person. she meets him, has sex, ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. the plot then deteriorates further.the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff. do not bother renting it much less purchasing it, even if it is in the $1 dvd bin. i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill. i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.

in fact it was awful. the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends. also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. sure these are ways to cut cost, but are they smart ways of keeping costs down? no they aren't. at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a "creative writing" course. those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure. at the very least, they could have read up on 3 act structure but acting obviously wasn't a priority either. watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by 1980's standards was an embarrassment. the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received. had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work, there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridge.i'd give this movie 10/10 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all. this movie should be shown to film students everywhere. it's better than 90% of student films i've seen and wow is this movie a piece of shiiiit.

what a despairing film. dress actors in furry rags, place in suburban wasteland, set cameras rolling and hope for the best. one can only imagine e the thanks the cast gave when their characters were killed off by sockpuppets, thus sparing them further humiliation in this dullfest. this rivals monster a go-go as the best cure for insomnia ever made. oh god - how can i fill up 10 lines explaining how overwhelmingly bored everybody looks in this movie? whiney crappy plastic bungling robot who annoys everybody both on and off screen, giant spider reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by string, actors desperately trying not to look at the camera while mumbling off dialogs...

cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. i watched this one first uncut and un-mst3k'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.the plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the ai robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. the 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air. every once in a while, the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death, so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark one.okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. on to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangly stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the dark one's henchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent). or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so-called 'actors', who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense. or the dime store special fx, including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can, and terrible 'mutants' with halloween rubber masks on.a band of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside, to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one. the guy's name is neo, which explains where the wachowski brothers got the idea for the matrix. they meet up with a group of amazons along the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested(of course). has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or t.v. show ever produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men or women? amazons are just pansies, i guess.this band of determined warriors makes their way through central park...errr...the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city(good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed new york city, anyway) and journey into the sewers leading to the power station where the dark one and his go-go girl henchwoman valeria hang out. here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms, a giant spider no one sees, and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the dark one's personal guard. the final showdown is pretty sad. one of the slaves, a girl who's father was taken by the dark one because he'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air, sees that her father has been 'consumed by the dark one's true form", which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado until only his head is sticking out. the three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper. the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines, and that's it. the end.

i was so "impressed" with tim kincaid's mutant hunt that i gave this one a try. it is the near future, post apocalypse of course. a wandering fighter named neo (no, not that neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the dark one and his underling valaria. along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. oh my! sadly, robot holocaust is hardly up (or down) to hunt's level. clocking in at a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is one cheap flick. the sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like john travolta in the final dance number of staying alive. the atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble filled old buildings and central park. the dark one's headquarters is ominously named the power station and looks like, well, a power station. the acting is universally bad except for angelika jager as the evil valaria. jager is a whole 'nother level of bad. vit er sick cherman acczent, she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film. she also delivers the film's only nudity in the "pleasure chamber" section of the film. ed french again supplies the robot effects but they aren't nearly as slimy as his work in mutant hunt.

i kind of like jag. it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. for an outsider (a non american) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.i don´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the tv show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army.i still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.

28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of chile, south america and the whole world. this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. true, he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis. he was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. we'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. the authors of the movie take a completely pro-allende position, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him, or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro. the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.

it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. a case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era. they are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their "badness" is entertaining. however, this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the "piranha" (1978) original. i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum. now in the mid-2000s with the c.s.i. shows, tv's an absolute blood-fest! (good for us horror fans!)william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies (the original 1978 stars.) it's not katt's and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. i won't say how because that is part of the plot. this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes here. stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!

i saw this one at sundance, and i can't figure out why it won the directing award. it was painfully slow and literally colorless. it's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath them.the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog, ultra-low-budget films. that's all well and good, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. mini-dv shot in a snow-covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie.certain motifs (snakes) are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols.now, it wasn't all bad. vera farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. she will be going places, and she deserves it. her co-star hugh dillon also does a fine job. frankly, there are many fine moments in this movie, but they just don't fit together very well.

what is it about drug addiction that so draws first-time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject? this subject has been done to death. drug abuse is bad. we get it. drug addiction is painful to watch. we get that too. but the bleak subject matter doesn't give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film. every film need not be hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence, or use orson wellesian deep focus, but it's still a narrative movie. verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. even consumer mini-dv cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks, and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting: the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography. and even documentary films have a sound mix. vera farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director obviously over-directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance. addicts may live in a fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seem to exist off-screen. the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people. sorry to be so harsh, debra, but some things are true whether want to believe them or not. i'm sure your next film will be better -- but please, not another drug movie. :)

nothing to watch here. it's all been done (and better) before. who cares about this woman - deficient in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? in one instant when she could have taken the high road - she jumped into re-addiction with both feet and held her breath - for no better a reason than "me, too!" if she wasn't the pretty and young person she portrays on screen - but looked more like the real human wreckage that is represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions we'd change channels in a nanosecond.this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill. nothing redeeming, no lessons taught - nothing uplifting in any way. none of the main characters even evoke sympathy, let alone empathy. (well, maybe the snake.) i would have had more fun if i'd shut a door on my hand. who needs drivel like this?

given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. but depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. the film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of vera farmiga in the central role of irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. but there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. the film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going. irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit. irene grows close to another recovering addict, a male nurse from her rehab center. complications ensue. but the story never really sparks to life. it doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere. you can say it's a stark, realistic look at the day-to-day struggles of an addict. maybe so but in this case it doesn't make for an interesting movie. the whole thing has a very "blah" feel to it. the minimalist cinematography doesn't help matters, adding another layer of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings. and none of the other performances measure up to farmiga's. hugh dillon is ok as irene's male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings. all in all this movie is a bleak, depressing and rather dull ride.

i think walter pidgeon was badly miscast in this film. just not believable in the role. barbara eden was beautiful, and acted her part well enough. no one else was at all memorable. i remember the tv series spun off from this movie when i was a small child. i even think i had a plastic "seaview" that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub. long time ago.as for some of the other criticism i've read for this film: it's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards. the effects were ok for 1961. not great, but ok. as for the science, that was ludicrous even for 1961. there's no excuse. also, the sub was awfully roomy. i understand that the navy refused any help at all for this film, so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea.overall, the film bored me. (and i'm a sci-fi fan.) can't recommend this one. grade: d-

only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb; the first difficulty faced by the submarine "seaview" is what appear to be chunks of--rock? falling down through the water and crashing into its hull. but it's not rock, they're under the north pole--it is ice! everybody, except possibly hitherto mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ice floats.then, disaster strikes--that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire! no one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is utterly impossible for radiation to "catch fire", and even if it could, there is no air in space for it to burn.there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school textbooks when making a film; however, irwin allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we are meant to focus on the "people" instead, which is pretty easy, as they are cardboard.the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp, much like later episodes of his "lost in space" tv series, the concept of which was swiped outright from writer ib melchior and then rushed into production.the sub looks pretty good, though, which is why this one gets a "2".

irwin allen, past master of cinematic schlock, pulled out all the stops in voyage to the bottom of the sea. a badly aged walter pidgeon, who actually may have been dead when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that must be the size of the empire state building. every room is gigantic and some even appear to have no ceilings. you could bowl and hold a formal ball simultaneously in some of these rooms. the sub, called the seaview, is on its maiden run when all hell breaks loose: the van allen radiation belt catches fire and the seaview must launch a missile into the belt by a certain time or the world will go down in global warming flames! along for the ride are a bunch of truly terrible character actors, many borrowed from tv. this makes them tv hack-tors. the worst is probably that poor man's stella stevens, barbara eden, as a naval secretary, squeezed into too-tight clothes, sporting high heels and acting like she's appearing in a beach party flick. maybe that's because frankie avalon is also along for the ride. a badly aged joan fontaine, almost unrecognizable here, plays a visiting doctor with a big bad secret, but in truth who cares? voyage is a truly bad movie obviously made for small children, but what child is going to sit still for endless shots of a miniature seaview model moving over and over again from right to left across the screen in what is obviously a studio tank? there is not one scene where we believe these folks are actually aboard a sub. when the seaview shakes, the actors fling themselves about, sometimes in opposite directions to one another. just like on the good old star trek tv series, when the bridge shakes. if i remember correctly, not one fish or sea creature is seen -- except for an octopus that momentarily latches onto the sub, a nod to 20,000 leagues under the sea. the octopus, if it was real, was probably about a foot long and it shows. worse, when folks are standing at the seaview's glass nose, the ocean they are supposedly watching is obviously a closeup involving an unseen air hose spouting bubbles, probably filmed in a fish tank. you have never seen bigger bubbles in your life. you'd think these bubbles alone would smash the damned sub to pieces. sadly, a badly aged peter lorre is also along for the ride. near the end, when the missile is entering the flaming belt, lorre is seen enthusiastically congratulating pidgeon while everyone else is still waiting for their cue to start shaking hands and embracing one another in victory. a one-take scene if i've ever seen one. what a stinker. it's not even good for a laugh. stick with silent running.

it's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. it certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. these days it's shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or amc.it pains me to report that veteran actors like walter pigeon and joan fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. it's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog. it's a comic book version of the jules verne novel.the maturing fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face, perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script. she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time. faring no better are robert sterling, barbara eden and--most of all, peter lorre--as well as frankie avalon, who gets to sing the title tune which--it's safe to say--did not become anyone's favorite title tune.an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence. totally unconvincing from start to finish. the film, as well as the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion.

i really wanted to like this movie. great cast  walter pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic "forbidden planet," barbara eden and robert sterling as young lovers, frankie avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a guy on a submarine a sailor?), even peter lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. maybe it's a good kiddie movie but i had trouble staying awake. lorre was severely underused. i guess he was a red herring, like pidgeon  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank. no such luck. by the way, why is there a shark tank on a submarine? it's typical of the movie's lack of ambition. they explain why lorre is walking the shark back and forth (because we're seeing it) but just expect us to accept the fact that there's a shark on this sub for some reason. "research?" yeah, scientists are always doing that research stuff, who can understand them? of course, if there wasn't a shark, who would kill the evil psychologist lady (joan fontaine)? i'm sorry but even kid's movies in the 50s are capable of being less predictable and frankly idiotic (not to mention exploitative).the first 10 or 15 minutes really got my hopes up. great theme song sung by frankie avalon. pidgeon leading floyd the barber (howard mcnear actually, sorry howie loved ya in "blue hawaii") and joan fontaine on a guided tour, careful to skip the room with the huge "warning" sign on the door, past peter lorre with aforementioned sharks, and then we see a full screen shot of eden shaking her moneymaker to avalon's impassioned horn playing! the movie quickly goes downstream from there. there's no real explanation for the firestorm threatening the earth, so there's a distinct lack of dramatic tension and no villain to boot. instead pidgeon's character is made into an unconvincing red herring vaguely of the ahab variety (i guess "the caine mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and fontaine's character suddenly turns evil for no reason at the end. oh, i suppose the reason is that it's a surprise for the audience. and it is kind of surprising, since the only negative thing she's done is to talk bad about the captain's mental health and there's still no reason why she did the sabotage after she's revealed to be the villain. very poorly done and unconvincing. the guy who was the pessimistic bible nut was better  at least his character made sense.so what else could go wrong? endless, interminable scuba-diving footage. i never understand the appeal of that kind of thing. a giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, just so there's a monster for the theatrical trailer. maybe that fooled some people into thinking it was going to be a fantasy adventure film, instead of a half-baked suspense movie about military scientists who are never wrong. yes  perhaps worst of all, it's barely a fantasy movie much less a science fiction movie. it never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing but another disaster/apocalypse and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery. i'm through with irwin allen. i never liked his later movies anyway, but this one got me by pretending to be jules verne when it's really just another formula exercise in disaster escapism. the whole movie is just waiting to see which character will improbably turn evil and die. he always hired an actor/actress with a charming and personable screen persona to play these roles and that's the only element of "surprise" to be found since there's no logic to these characters anyway. what a pathetic waste of time for these actors. george pal's movies are 100 times better (the only one that was lame was "atlantis," which, not coincidentally, was the most allen-esquire), full of wonder and excitement and  think of it!  ideas! other than a few effects scenes and barbara eden, there's nothing worth seeing here in my opinion. i guess it's good fun for those who are into disaster movies, but i think they are a hollow and dull genre of films.

this movie was really bad. first they didn't even follow the facts for it. half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of ed gein's victims. the acting was horrible, except for the guy playing ed gein, but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. as soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill. the writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it didn't need to be. the story of ed gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.

i'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the usos seaview (yes, sos...) why, you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so large. and how 'bout the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? did i mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? and the admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? big bleeping sub...ok, ok...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity. and if the sub is laughable, the plot is even worse. somehow the van allen belts of radiation, hundreds of miles in space, have "caught fire" are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast. pompous admiral nelson (walter pidgeon), along with his sidekick lucius (peter lorre, looking suitably uncomfortable) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst.there's plenty of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a born-again survivor (and his little dog, too!) two "dames" who can never leave well enough alone, a passel of "red shirts" who are expendable, and plot holes big enough for godzilla to walk through. thrill to the seaview being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub -- no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet astern.the movie careens from one cliff-hanger to another; the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless, certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait.the technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines. worth watching, if only to riff upon.

i suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be " cool " , but looking back now ( 45 years ) it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value ! granted , the special effects do well on t.v. with the series that started in 1964 , but for the big screen ?? i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting ! i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview. obviously not well staged...or trained ! overall , it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it - for fun laughs sake. this was probably one of irwin allen's biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it . barabara eden went on to play " genie " on t.v. micheal ansara was her husband . now that is a cool part about this film ! i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie . neat !

what a waste of time to watch this movie. poor picture quality, poor sound, poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts. the deputy's "girlfriend" did so much overacting, as did the sheriff, that it was more comedy than horror. the deputy tries to make an emergency phone call by dialing 911...problem...in 1957 that emergency number was not in existence. that is just one example of glaring inconsistencies.the "scary" aspect was way underdone. just did not come across as horrific.i did think that the actor playing gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie. i could well see mental disturbances in his character portrayal.sorry...this one just does not get it!!

this was, without a doubt, the worse horror movie i have ever seen.... forget the fact that the story had little to do with the facts of ed gein... ed gein's story is horrific & this movie ignored the facts and strayed way off course. acting, on all levels, was pathetic. story, again, for some unknown reason didn't go into the horrific facts. could have been so scary if it would have stuck to the facts. what were they thinking? terrible movie! steve railsback version was much, much better. don't waste a penny on this terribly made flick... and, why ignore the reality of the horrific events? that alone would make for a great story. man, makes you wonder why this would ever be approved for release. why spend so much money on a movie that will never make a penny (except for my wasted $5...

i stopped watching this film half way through. it was just terrible! boring, contrived subplots. a complete lack of the pathos seen in norman bates, buffalo bill, or steve railsback's portrayal of ed gein. a movie doesn't have to be historically accurate, but the true story of ed gein is so much more interesting than this third-rate melodrama that was completely made up for no good reason! ed gein as portrayed by kane hodder is a cartoon sadist. the attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled style. and this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even screwed that up. fortunately, there is a better film of this story. 2001's ed gein told the story efficiently, and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself. steve railsback, who played ed gein that time, was already famous for memorably portraying another famous serial killer: charles manson. his ed had pathos. his film is the one to see. avoid this mess.

***may contain spoilers***i had very high expectations for this film, based on the trailer. i knew a bit about the real ed gein, so i figured this was a medium-budget hollywood version of the real events. man was i wrong.first, the writing apparently came from an eight-grader who barely knew anything about ed's history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes. the movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his house) and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set. likewise, all of the male characters seem to be ad-libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie. i'm not exaggerating.don't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie. seriously, who the hell directed this? this movie is supposed to take place around 1957, but the cops are carrying modern side-handled batons, some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from lowes, and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 9-1-1 (didn't exist back then). also, ed was a small guy, scary like anthony perkins' character in psycho (who was supposedly based on real-life ed), not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in men in black.another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned, 3 building set. because of the "clever" camera angles, you never see any actual town, and the interior of the sets looked like old, long-abandoned shacks. pop a cash register on a saw-horse and bam!--instant hardware store.i'm usually pretty forgiving of low-budget horror films, but this one just begs for it. all you had to do was include most of the real events (even embellish them!), pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones, and for pete's sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while. my advice: google ed gein, you'll be far more entertained.

it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come. "oh yeah", the public will say, "'comanche moon', that's the mini series about the texas rangers and the comanche indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert duval. it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in. i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy. i really don't understand why they agreed to be in it". that would be such an injustice as the original "lonesome dove" was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and duval will be remembered for it.

i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line. zahn spends so much time mimicking duvall he does nothing else in the show. and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man, unlikeable yes but weak never. we never see how or why they go to back to lonesome dove...which is a dirt hole in the original...why would they ever leave austin where they are hero's...for doing nothing during the whole movie...i was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast. there is no warning about how many segments there are...it just ends. this mini-series could have been "somebody"...tragic. it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the jag

film critics of the world, i apologize. it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt. however, my decision to see "the cat in the hat" wasn't made haphazardly. you see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the "calamity" known as "how the grinch stole christmas". then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. so when the critics unleashed their fury against "the cat in the hat", another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role, i thought that it must be the same old song. how wrong i was.for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear. the opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. then the cat showed up. there are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers. where "the grinch" was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey, "the cat" was destroyed by myers. he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from "wayne's world" to "austin powers". so he tries to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl, not funny, just painful. not that the writers helped him out any. after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had. period. so much talent and work went into something so vile. i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies. if you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague. with movies like "elf" and "brother bear" currently in theaters, you have far better choices.

don't get me wrong, i assumed this movie would be stupid, i honestly did, i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). as i began watching i noticed something, this film was terrible. now there are two types of terrible, there's freddy vs. jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless, but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. mike myers is usually brilliant, i love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. one of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the cat. coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. the book was like an ice cream sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust.avoid this like a leprous prostitute.

there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. first of all, let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. cat was... well, just awful.jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.why, why, why mike myers?? the kids could care less, and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film. so, what was the studio thinking?the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond. can we talk? why a new york accent? not entirely consistent with anything dr. seuss has ever written. myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick. i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said "as long as you don't say fahklempt', you can keep the accents." meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make-up, or dialogue.the jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: "dirty ho", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped.the same folks who created 'whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat'. the sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and myers.there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston. dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr. seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.call the spca. this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. please, please, no sequel.

what to say about this movie? a married couple has more then just each other. after playing around for some time things gets more serious. a difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. guess what happens at the end. this movie seems to be very low budget. but a good story don't have to be expensive. it looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house. from the first minute future developments are clear as water. nothing unexpected happens. sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there's no story. i find this movie disappointing so that's explains the vote (4).

"love life" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. i found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. for example, thomas falls for joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. there are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. in the end, i found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. stephan d. gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance, and all-too-often acting chops to match. many times, the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn. stephanie kirchen does a fine job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me, since i was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie.

grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film. its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. the acting is very normal. the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. the whole reunion and the 'wow, i haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them. it just all seemed very tacky, pointless and was poorly executed. dan akroyd's role as a 'rival' assassin is very sparse. he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a 'final show down' which is hugely hyped up but doesn't deliver at all.the soundtrack is also very mediocre. the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980's and with the exception of two or three, are very bad. hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this film.i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department, the way that half the time you forget that cusak's character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non-existent.even the way the comedy thinks it's funny; but it isn't. i didn't laugh once during this movie. sure, maybe i smirked now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly over!please, don't waste your time with 'grosse pointe blank' despite the relatively high (but badly incorrect) imdb rating. i've seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there. just don't bother with this one.

i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. this has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.the concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on american idol. you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. but we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. so how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an american idol tryout? it would be pointless as this movie was.the use of improv is over-rated. we've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. i feel that is improv. improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. if you like that drew carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film.overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. if a guy playing a trumpet and the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. for me, i prefer more heady stuff like "i love lucy" or "hee-haw".but remember, i think snl lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this g-rated humor. i kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. that's the humor you can expect.my only wish was that i could give this a minus rating.

just to let everyone know, this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen pretty much everything. if you're thinking of renting it, don't!!! it's not worth the cardboard container that it came in....

college students (who are actually in their late 20's) on campus in boston (which looks strangely like the isle of man) are menaced by a fierce monster (assembled during a blue peter episode). the new teacher must save the day (even though he is really... oh, who cares?)i'll start with the positives... there is a nice shot of eastenders new gal samantha janus's can in the obligatory campus shower scene with her best mate katy lawrence. a bit of side trivia: katy was hired when she arrived at auditions with her sister, just as moral support to her sibling but ended up landing a part. oh, joy. picked from obscurity to... flash her pert buttocks in a meaningless scene added for titillation, then getting killed 30 minutes in for her troubles. her latest (and only other credited role) is as probationary nurse #5 in atonement. i wonder if she snuck a look at keira knightly (if extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did it all go wrong?!i'll give a few hints katy: if all the other british cast members are asked to speak with american accents in a doomed attempt at mass-marketing, and the only person who can manage it is the b-movie veteran usa native todd jensen, you know you're in trouble. if you look at your wage slip and it'll only just about cover your lunch and your bus ride home, you ain't starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. if the premiere is attended by loads of family members of the fourth assistant director and provokes gales of laughter when the stickyback tape monster rampages through the sewers, it should dawn on you that this isn't exactly alien. or even a critters iv, come to think of it. so katy, in your next life (i'm a buddhist, you see) perhaps you'll be a bit more selective in your choice of debut feature rather than impulsively jumping at the first pile of crap that heads your way. flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long lasting success. unless you're sylvester stallone. and he had the script to rocky to back him up.to all intents and purposes this is as 0/10 a movie as i've ever seen. however, for sheer unintentional laughs and pure camp value, it gets a 1. well done ;)

this was a pathetic movie. the alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. the plot is something that's been done over and over again! however, this one does it the worst! the acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. no one developed any concern for the main character. the movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie. there are some movies which "suck" but can still be enjoyed because of there total outrageousness, but this doesn't even have that!! whoever made this film thought that they could make something good and they failed miserably. there is nothing this movie has to offer except a headache. avoid it!

after a meteorite lands in "boston" (really somewhere in the isle of man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. this film is apparently a loose (and i stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. this isn't. let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad. this film is supposed to take place in boston (we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting "boston police" or "boston gas company" on everything), yet everyone seems to have rather muddled british accents (at least they didn't try using boston accents, thank god). the script is a big flawed mess. the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite. is that what our brave heroes do? no, they run around shooting the zombie-students instead. nice. director paul matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films. the movie is terribly boring in places. the lighting is awful. the film looks cheap and bland. one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore. 99% of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away, while we hear they're "horrified" screams off in the distance. this convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here. the visual effects were awful. the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake! the "explosion" of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful. okay, i like to consider myself a fair critic, so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool. gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!to sum the film up, "breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus. not recommended.1.5/10.

imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. add more plot holes than plot. have it scripted by a 10 year old. have the acting done by a-level drama students faking really bad us accents (in the isle of man!) add monster special effects that the lovers of b&w dr who shows will appreciate. result: duff film. throw in samantha janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!

it's strange what fate does to some people. while looking in the discount bin at a dvd retailer, i came across a copy of deadly instincts. being a collector of any film that is either sci-fi, horror or featuring alien monsters, i decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars  a bargain, believe me). after viewing it, i came to the opinion that it was nothing special. but after doing some research on the internet, i discovered that the film was actually called breeders & was a remake of the tim kincaid horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid-1980s. which i've already seen. my appreciation of "deadly instincts" grew following that discovery.a meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college. the sole teacher there, ashley (played by todd jensen  that's right, the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick cyborg cop four years earlier), notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear, while encountering a black-haired woman with a scarred face & wearing a kinky leather outfit. his investigation reveals that an alien creature had hitched a ride on the meteorite & had come to earth to breed using the local womenfolk. along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the disappearances, ashley tries to stop the monster.the original breeders, directed by tim kincaid (who would leave the genre to make gay porn), was a sci-fi / horror film which was actually a thinly-veiled soft-core porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans. it is, in my belief, one of the worst films made in the 1980s. why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mystery.this remake is actually a better effort than its low-budget source. the film, which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women, eliminates any pornographic elements. in fact, the film is actually very tame. there are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during the shower scene), swearing & violence are kept to a minimal level & there is no gore (which may cheat gorehounds). this makes the remake a film safe for the whole family, that is if the kids aren't scared by alien monsters (which brings me to the film's m 15+ rating, which seems a bit much).tameness of subject matter aside, the film does have some faults. the script, while featuring some good characterizations, has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor through.what? you're mad at me for that? come on, this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interesting.anyway, the film's setting is one problem the script failed to fix  the film is set in boston but the buildings don't look like they belong in boston. something about the architecture ain't right. another thing is the college itself, with a rather large building housing about twenty students (all female, of course) & only having one class  art. the only teacher there has a relationship with a student (& so does the janitor!), which somehow escapes the attention of the principal. not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (& stupid) that the real boston pd would have a good case if they ever decided to sue. oh, & the meteor well the chance that a meteor which is sent from saturn (check the opening credits) reaches earth with no onboard propulsion is astronomical. that doesn't include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landing.as far as the acting goes, todd jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher while the late kadamba simmons (who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out) cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit, as well as proving she can act. the visual effects are run-of-the-mill, with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool-looking monster.

dire beyond belief. obviously set on the isle of man masquerading as the us - very badly - and full of cut-rate british actors who can't do american accents. a monster that looks like an unarticulated promotional cut-out for alien from a movie store, with the most inflexible feet ever seen. girls in the shower, undressing, catfighting, blah, blah, blah. you get the idea. don't watch it, run away, hide, avoid.

of all the movies in the history of movies i can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, i want to spend x amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called "breeders." lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside. why not put your money into making a spectacular 3d remake of "it came from outer space" instead? why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds? was the script for the 1986 version of "breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly? when you come down to it, the only reason this film exists is to show off britcom cutie pie samantha janus. but if you're gonna make a skin flick and exploit sam janus in it, you'd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed.meteor lands ... monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" ending ensues.honestly, i never thought i would ever recommend the original "breeders" over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd place to it.

i've read other hacks' reviews of this movie, and while it certainly isn't the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it isn't that bad if you accept it for what it is - low-budget, b-movie fare that (shall we say) "borrows heavily" from the likes of 'alien' (nasty extraterrestrial monster that cocoons its victims) 'species' (gorgeous and confused "space girl") and 'incubus' (the beastie-breeding-with-captive-girls angle). this is one seriously cheesy movie, and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget, although the alien isn't too bad (i've seen far less convincing men-in-rubber-suits at any rate). none of the acting is oscar material and the isle of man doesn't really double for boston massachussetts very convincingly. the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel squillions of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an all-girls college campus - thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is utterly laughable. however, the movie does have its suspenseful moments, there's a few helpings of nudity and semi-nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model / actress kadamba simmons (as the "space girl") who, at the age of only 24, was murdered in london by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.

this movie was so bad it was funny! for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la "for your consideration"). the "cliffhanger" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. the script was dreadful enough, but coupled with sean young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie. i still can't believe how this thing got made. first of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? how did star actors get attached? were they at low points in their careers? questions, questions.

there's simply no redeeming quality about this film. ok, some of the costumes are ok, but they're nothing you can't see in, say, the conan flicks. and what's up with ator's hair? i can't believe this is part of a series! i will say one thing about this film: it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else.

this movie's one redeemable quality (besides ator's barely-there loincloth) is the hilarious acting on the part of the bad guy, zor. this wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain...oh, shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). i just giggled every time he pirouetted, lifting an incredulous eyebrow to henchman or hero. a true example of someone not getting paid enough. (and that beard!)now really, what was with the 12-minute hang-glider scene? really, really, really bad. i can't emphasize that point enough.so, seriously, if you even deign to see this movie, watch the mystery science theater 3000 version. with those dear silhouettes has many a horrendous movie been tolerated.

i just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show "mystery science theater 3000!!!!!" and yes, i do find that advice really helpful! i mean, a movie that tries to be this good and this exciting just really is not what that movie wants to be!!!!! so yes, do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars, you can give this a ten out of ten stars! until then, my one star review is for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie only!!!!!! got that now?

tycus is one of the worst films direct to video films that i see ever.i am not amazing that this product does not appearing at the cinema.bad visual effects (the start is dreadful)bad actors (i don´t understand why appear in this film the great dennis hopper)and bad screen without sense.my alternative:armaggedon or twister. sentence for tycus:do not watch this film.

unimpressive and extremely low budget sci-fi without any charm and appeal. even the scenes related with the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot. it's just a bad rip-off of "asteroid" (with annabela sciora) and "deep impact" (with morgan freeman). mr. hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull sci-fi entry.i give this a 2 (two). and don't say i'm not a good guy!

oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting-the-earth film. coming within a year or two of deep impact, armageddon, space cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you'd think people would be burned out on this concept. apparently not, since i rented it, hoping it might not be awful: dennis hopper was in it, after all, and he's a good actor, right?i forgot something important: along with peter o'toole, robert de niro and quite a few other esteemed actors, hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films. not only that, but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes. his performance in tychus is so awful that you expect divine or edith massey to appear in some scenes.i don't know what else to say about this rubbish, other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films, watch deep impact, and then armageddon and space cowboys at a stretch. forget the others altogether. this one really is bottom of the pile.

oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. my lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink. i would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again. painful story line, painful characters and a painful two hours.the best way of describing this movie is a follows:- i would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe.advice is to stay well clear and let your local dustman do you a favour of removing this rubbish.lin, you told me this was good!!!!goodaleebyeload.

'tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go.i can hardly find something good to say about this film. the premises are completely wrong. a comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this.a whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody noticing. when the comet nears earth the news make it to the tv and newspapers hardly a day before the event. and so on, and so on ...neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen. is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast? the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done, and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say. the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this film was made.a total waste of time.

stinger starts '3 months ago' on the submarine the ss newark where genetic experiments have gone awry & the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions... jump to 'camp pendleton' a couple of months later where general ashford (james cagnard) brief's lieutenant williams (john miranda) on his mission to board the newark & assist genetic scientist dr. carly ryan (michelle meadows), before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists & marines are on-board the newark & are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from dr. mike thompson (casey clark) who doesn't make much sense. it's not long before the scorpions attack, first to fall is lt. williams so sergeant sam harmon (christopher persson) is promoted & takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety & end the menace of the giant scorpions forever...this sweedish america co-production was directed by martin munthe & he also handled the cinematography & i thought this was a strictly by-the-numbers uninspiring creature feature. it's early into the new year & stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster/creature/insect type film i've seen in 2007, hopefully things can only get better... the script by mat nastos is incredibly clichéd & gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably aliens (1986), lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine, there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film, there's the scientists including a blonde sweedish one to try & explain it all & the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life & the final ingredient being the monster/alien/insect or whatever, in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers. yeah, it's all here, unfortunately stinger isn't an aliens if you get what i mean. it's a touch long at over 100 minutes & it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace & as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdb...director munthe doesn't distinguish himself, it's not scary, there's a lack of atmosphere & the action scenes are dull & unexciting. there's not many scorpion attacks & it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs, the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse that's for sure. i mean that's not to say the effects in stinger are good but i've seen worse. there isn't much blood or gore, there's some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads & someone is ripped in half. the only clever & amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions... however there was a moment which had me groaning & tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine's circuitry & get the lights working by hitting the power supply/computer boards with a hammer & it works as well...technically stinger is average at best & there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous. stinger was shot in stockholm in sweeden if your interested. the acting was poor & there's nothing else to say.stinger isn't a great film & it isn't a great horror film either, i can't recommend it at all but i've seen worse. if you liked stinger (unlikely) you might like the similarly themed 'giant scorpions on the loose' films tail sting (2001) or scorpius gigantus (2006) (just as unlikely).

at the very beginning, the look at a control panel that reads "8 miles of the cost of california", and no, i didn't misspell that, they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast. these people must have been morons.it's good if you're into terrible movies, but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever. the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever.wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch. how these folks made any money off this is beyond me.

i'm a fan of low budget b-movies and campy horror flicks, but this was too much, even for me.if you can get past the weak plot, the cheesy effects and the uninspired acting, then the horrible writing will kill you, or you'll wish it would. the dialog was most likely written by high school stoners, who thought that saying "sir, yes sir" over and over again, made these guys sound more military.the characters were all the typical cardboard stereotypes: gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho other guy with sensitive side, evil scientist with secret agenda (bald or course), bitchy brainy chick who would be hot if she tried too, dumb sexy chick with vital piece of information, idiot "genius" nerd, random other sorta military dudes who die soon enough, and spoiler character alert, crazy scientist who was in charge "until something went horribly wrong" oh yeah, i almost forgot, there is a secret military (navy?) submarine, sitting on the ocean floor, 5 minutes from hq (or so it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and dead bodies. your mission is vague and poorly defined.....if you watch this, don't say you weren't warned.

some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everybody. two months later, some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the sub to retrieve their cargo. after finding 200 dead bodies, the marine commander tells the doctor "i need to know if there's anything down here that could be a danger to my men". uh, gee...ya think? she refuses to tell him what is down there, citing "need to know". yup, that pretty well sizes it up. one of the scientists is apparently some sort of idiot savant - real heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. he's given the task of fixing the lights. he finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire, and shrieks like a banshee. then he does it again. then he takes a hammer and smashes the control panel to pieces, which causes all the lights on the submarine to start working.and so it goes. apparently this was made in sweden; i'm not sure if the swedes have a really weird sense of humor or if they're just really awful movie makers. i'm inclined to think they're awful movie makers. if you guessed that there's a huge explosion at the end of this thing, well, sorry, but that's on a need-to-know basis, so i can't tell you.if you've absolutely got to see a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest tail sting, which is a cheesy and fun movie about scorpions on a plane, or bugs, which is a fairly descent b movie about scorpions in a tunnel. look at this movie as an absolute last resort. oh, it's watchable, it's hard to turn it off just because of the sheer lunacy of it, but that's about all it's got going for it.

even by the standards of most b-movies, this movie is by far the worst i've ever seen. the graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable, including the one scene where they board the mini-sub, and the "water" looks like its frozen in place. the problems with this film are so numerous that i'll just stop here with the details. needless to say, i kid you not when i say that even uwe toilet boll himself could do a better job. avoid this movie at all cost, there are other b grade movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way of passing the time by.

this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date. the premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute. the acting is terrible. the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best film' notation? the only reasons i didn't turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plot line could really keep going on as is was. i was not disappointed by this latter notion. there wasn't even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested! also, i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of "resident evil 2" in the movie... was that supposed to be filler? 'cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie.

pretty disappointing. i was expecting more of a horror/thriller -- but this seemed to be more of an episode of dawson's creek but with out the acting. there were some very impressive shots, though -- almost worth seeing. maybe future efforts will improve.

it is the early morning of our discontent, and some friends of mine and i have just gotten through watching "the wind." truly a disaster film. not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting populace, but rather an awful movie wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting audience. to give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb, i'll give you an example quoted during my first pained viewing. if given the choice of watching this movie for a second time and, say, boiling myself, i'm afraid to say the choice would not be an immediate one. but rather than simply ranting "ad peliculam" with lousy one-liners, i'm going to get specific as to why exactly my friends and i panned this particular film.to start this off, i like low-budget horror flicks. i even like artsy, low-budget horror flicks. i liked "cold hearts", "midnight mass," "jugular wine," etc. films that were ambitious and daring, even if they were lacking in production value, execution and even acting. generally, an interesting premise, unusual camera technique or merely just a well done scene or two will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges. with these provisos in mind, i would like to say conclusively that i hated "the wind."the movie was probably most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. from the actions of the main characters, to the flow (?) of the plot, to the big portents hinted at by the opening which ultimately aspired to dust (and did not even attach themselves logically to what transpired in the remainder of the film, and left the viewer, expecting something more, with a sense of much ado about nothing). the dialogue was spotty at best, woodenly delivered and completely unrealistic. by this i mean, no one in any of the situations that the characters were in would have reacted the way the characters did, or said the things that they said in the way that they said them. there was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. character interaction and development was abysmal. claire, the "lambent sex goddess," or so the aggravating, passive-aggressive lamesters in the movie thought, was so overt in her manipulations she may as well have pulled a gun on the characters. nevertheless, she was the shining high point of the film. the other main characters (with the exception of mick's milfy mom, who was not terrible) are so indistinct that they may as well have been portrayed by the same actor. let's see if i missed anything: borderline personality, co-submissive goons with profound feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, spurred to fits of puerile rage through the artless orchestrations of a loose-lipped bimbette-suddenly-and-unmasterfully-turned-caligari. no, i think that about covers it.lack of scope was also problematic. how did those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to derive that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish, unbelievable, poorly-portrayed lust pentagon (well, what would you call it?) that occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? there were no witnesses to the "atrocities" presented. there were no witnesses anywhere in this film.the believability problems stemming from this lack of attention to detail were rife even from the point where the plot begins to sicken. case-in-point: if that guy bob took that route through the woods to come home from the gym, and here's the key, ****every day****, there's a jolly good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards while the perpetrators argued vociferously about the crime scene. one would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods, said town would have been in an uproar, the characters would have been questioned, etc. but instead, there wasn't a witness in sight (other than earl, the closet psychopath with no inner monologue). we suggest that there be no witnesses *for* this film, either. as for the quasi-homosexual meanderings present, i don't have a problem with those either. it's not as if they came as a surprise, considering we had been shouting as to the closet case stati of most of the male characters since the second scene. again, not problematic in and of itself, but thrown in for the wrong reasons. it was utterly unnecessary, thrown in for pure "shock" and/or "dangerous art" value, and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. what we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring, clumsy movie with a boring, clumsy plot. the poorly hinted-at sexual tension, which was only hinted at heavy-handedly in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene, only pushed this film further down the totem pole from "mediocrity warranting criticism" to "film sucking so bad that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to properly mock and harangue."so it is with most of the film, a lot of artistic fumbling, very little meat and a lot of aggravation. it's not that we don't get it. oh, we got it, alright. we just don't want it. look, the very fact that we were cheering the bludgeoning in the final scene as the *only* tableau that made sense on its face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film. rather than moving briskly along as its name implies, this movie oozed languidly forward like the sweat trail working it's way down the side of your nose while your hands are full. argh. that sensation pretty well sums up the gut-wrenching frustration realized while watching this train wreck. there is no breath of fresh air with regard to this movie, only the stale miasma of bad ideas poorly realized, putrefying before coming to fruition.

actually i feel like having my review be that one word. my friend, whose opinions i almost always trust about movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was, because it was a complete waste of time. unfortunately i haven't talked to him in a while, and i was in a hurry to pick a movie, and thought, 'what the heck, how bad could it be?' why don't i learn? what was i thinking? did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented?the 'plot' concerns a guy who edits films for some company. his boss is a jerk. the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the pre-credits sequence, so for some reason the boss picks nerdy 'ed' for the special project of editing "loose limbs" splatter movies. he never says what ed is supposed to edit, but i guess that doesn't matter. ed is upset by some of the clips, working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason. he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. he starts to slowly go insane, supposedly from watching the clips, and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life. or has he been this way all along? please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep, interesting, and coherent than it actually is.we don't care about the characters at all, or have any sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. the plot is really, really boring and predictable. the splatter isn't even that gruesome or creative-this is not worth renting just to see the gore, because what there is isn't interesting or original.all the 'tributes' to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs, and no-one in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell, so you can't distract yourself with that. i think an "evil dead ii-dead by dawn" poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action. a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay. every time i hear lines like "are we having fun...yet?" (which even bride of re-animator couldn't pull off without making me wince) i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself. characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation, wandering in only to get killed. this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining, but it was all i could do to keep from fast-forwarding through most of it. fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing. trust me, it did not require my full attention-i still felt like 90+ minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the background.don't watch it, no matter how tempted you are-you'll hate yourself for wasting your money. horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is. even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away, as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while. if you want something brainless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. be smarter than i was at the time and don't be fooled by the "warning-not for the faint of heart" on the box. you have been warned!

this flick is terrible! it sets out to disgust and make you laugh, but it fails horribly. the director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing i've ever seen - lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy. even their attempt at the english languish is really sad, and actually the down right peculiar swedish accent, in which the incoherent dialog is spoken, is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film. even the gore i awful and unconvincing. if you crave gore comedy, i'd suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must. we all enjoy a bloody good laugh, but this is ridiculous!

a swedish splatter movie? has the world gone insane?probably not, but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore-flicks, the b-movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days, long gone are the golden days of "rymdinvasion i lappland". and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own: it's just too much talk in it, it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx, which are great for a b-movie. the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though, but that actually don't matter that much, it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more, that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason. there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void. every person who know about gert fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt. though. i nearly laughed my ass off. it's really that hilariously bad. besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starved for swedish b-movies.4/10

first when does this storyline take place? it has to take place after the first movie because kuzco knows pacha and chicha has her third child but it can't take place after the second movie because doesn't kronk get a girlfriend or wife or something? you never see her in the show.also, why is kuzco going to school? the whole plot of the show is that kuzco is going to school so that he can be emperor. but wasn't he emperor before this? and who's emperor while he learning to be emperor? shouldn't that be yzma? or was yzma fired in this time line already? and if that true why is waiting for him to fail to become empresses? plus, you know in the first movie he said he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private tutors. so he should kinda know what he's doing.kronk. why is kronk a student? he's around 25 they stated that in the first movie. he's an adult going to high school. does everyone think he's a moron? i really like kronk but i think because of his age and because everyone know that he is working for yzma he should have been a teacher. being a home ec teacher would be right up his alley.malina, is very unlikable. she suppose to be kuzco's love interest/moral compass. but a lot of time, she comes off bossy and know it all. she commonly says thinks i like "i should be proud because i am pretty and smart". she has esp when it comes to kuzco and knows whenever he's in trouble, when he's cheating, or even when he sings the hot hot hottie song in his head even though she does cheer leading, school newspaper and keeps straight a+ in all of her classes. she seems more interested in using her prettiness to get kuzco to do the right thing and do well in school then dating him. in fact, she seems more motherly to kuzco then a love interest.yzma. as i bought up before yzma is trying to get kuzco to fail so she become empresses. not sure how that's suppose to work with being fired and all. yzma seems to be reliving the first movie in every episode. in almost every show that she appears in she turns kuzco into an animal in hopes of having him fail a class. (there are only 3 times that i can think of that that didn't happen.) the jokes about yzma being old aren't as clever in the show as they were the movie. and classic jokes about yzma are used to death in the show (like the "pull the level, krunk!", roller-coaster, and the lab). also, some other points that don't make sense in this series. the fact that whenever kuzco is assigned something everyone acts like this assignment will make him pass or fail the class but he seems to pass every assignment given to him. so why does one assignment matter so much?seriously, who is ruling the kingdom while this is going on? do they have a consul or a steward? you never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless kuzco has weaseled his powers back or yzma is empresses.why is kuzco going to a normal peasant school? shouldn't he learning about how to lead a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? i could see taking some normal classes on like farming (so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that) but knot tying? how is that helpful?now i know that someone is going to say "but it not suppose to make sense; it's suppose to be funny." then they should have more funny things in there. all the funny things about the show have been done already in the movie. also, if they notice some of these huge plot holes why don't they poke fun at them like in the movie? (for example, when yzma and kronk get to the secret lab before kuzco and pacha and yzma and kronk can't explain how they got their first.)there are some good points, it is nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like bucky and monkey with the bug. pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good down earth feel. i feel that this series would be amusing for younger children. in conclusion, the series is not as good as the movie that it based on but it may good for younger children.

this show is not in my opinion, good,then again i have not enjoyed any cartoon from disney channel. except for "the proud family" because that so is about a normal female teen this show is very similar to the way i feel about lilo and stich the series. it was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent, the cartoon is terrible. disney channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as dave the barbarian, brandy and mr. whiskers, lilo and stich the series, american dragon jake long,and where it all started: kim possible. the shows would have been better had they come to playhouse disney! as for this particular show kuzko will never get out of school just as dave the barbarian's parents will never return home, and as brandy and mr. whiskers will never get out of the jungle.

all this show is, is the same plot. kuszko (spelling?) is in danger of failing school, he needs to pass to become emperor. he needs to learn something, which he thinks is stupid, he then uses it/ learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid. eezma, posing as the principal, tries to transform kuszko into some animal to stop him. every episode.jokes from the movie are copied (eezma's incredibly complicated plans, kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly, squirrels.) they should try hiring some writers.2/10

i cannot believe this show was okay-ed. first off j.p. manoux does a horrible job filling in for david spade and pacha's voice is too deep compared to john goodman's. the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid!!! the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of yzma and kronk. this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. half of the episodes are copied of the movie. in my opinion the emperor's new groove was one of the best children's movies in years, but they complety ruined by making kronk's new groove and this show. you should watch such shows as spongebob, fairly oddparents, danny phantom, or kim possible but not this show.

i think this was a horrible mistake on disney's part. first off, kuzco does not need to pass "emperor school" to become emperor! that's never happened before. secondly, the new voices don't sound like the originals at all. very poor redo. and while i adored the movie the emperor's new groove, the new school is just stupid. like all the jokes are the same, and many are from the movie. the plot gets redundant, always yzma (is that how you spell it?) trying to become empress, kuzco stopping her, etc. or kuzco learning to become a better person. i think kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions. he is a spoiled brat and it bothers me. i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time, much less a half hour.

i don't normally write reviews, in fact, i never write reviews. this film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start. virtual sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings; virginity, boys etc. except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair. sound interesting? well, it isn't. the acting is the most half-hearted and appalling i have ever seen. the unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie, which probably explains why i have never seen them in any memorable production since. i have not bothered to learn the actors names, nor their characters. the lading lady does not enrapture or charm you and, thus, you do not care for her whatsoever. the leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. the only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. the only half decent actor was the blonde leading man, who, despite his miserably weak role, really gave it all he could, which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work. i will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot. but then again, what plot?i watched this film unfold incredulously, as i had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script, nevermind produce, act in, and direct it. i can only wonder. the only reason my companion and i continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion, logic, class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film. i have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public. this is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. if that.

if you like bad movies (and you must to watch this one) here's a good one. not quite as funny as the first, but much lower quality. a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing.

this film, which i rented under the title "black voodoo" should be avoided. i was expecting a blaxploitation/horror flick; but what i got was a very dull, standard "ghost extracts vegence". in this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment, but who's plea was ignored and he died in an operation. the result: his spirit posesses nurse sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder. the only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters, in this case a blinded ex-football player, who's mom practiced voodoo. the film is very slow and very dull. there is a very standard ending that provides on excitement, followed by a horrificly stupid ending (warning: spoiler)in which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed. this movie is slow, and bad in a non-funny, just stupefying way. avoid it at all costs.

the first 20 minutes were a little fun because i don't think i've seen a film this bad before {acting, script, effects (!), etc....} the rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect. these people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie. there's no adult language, a bit of brief nudity, and no gore except fake blood smeared over no open wounds, etc.. it would have been rated pg in the early eighties and pg-13 nowadays. i'm not sure how it got an r rating or if it really did. i saw the american international release titled hospital of terror. i've seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film i've ever seen. here's an example of how bad it is: there's one scene where something green comes through the door. i'm not sure what it's supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kid's green crayon scribblings {i'm not exaggerating} super-imposed over the film, semi-moving inside the door, then its supposed to do something to nurse sherri to possess her i suppose. i could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.

'til there was you is one of the worst films we've ever seen. it fails in every respect. jeanne tripplehorn was better (as an actress...) in waterworld. in comparison, this film is dungworld. when a character stumbles once, or even twice, in the course of a film, one can understand it. but jeanne's character falls, trips, stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her. in her defence, each (prat?) fall was probably blocked, choreographed, and rehearsed. and rehearsed. although this is bad enough for a film, the actors (dylan mcdermott and jeanne tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going "out for a smoke" or trying to find a place to smoke. if the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke- ok - but, it isn't.however long this film runs, it is too long by 10 minutes past the running time.oh, jeanne tripplehorn, almost acts in a public forum meeting. you almost see her break life into the character. oh, it's almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instinct--hmm, on second thought, not really.this is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch outtakes of hooper (burt reynolds). and even then, toss a coin or go to sleep.

from the beginning, 'til there was you was on the right track, setting up for the big finish where it would all come together. but the thing is, it didn 't. i found the ending extremely disappointing, but maybe in someway it was the right ending; a little more realistic you could say. judge for yourself.

the film has weird annoying characters, strange unexplainable slapstick, and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking. the movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy, empty-headed woman's (jeanne tripplehorn) search for love. although who would ever like jeanne's character, personality, or reading of the dialogue, i really cannot say. except that she likes to smoke.sarah jessica parker gives an interesting character performance (who likes to smoke). dylan mcdermott does his best to look pretty and soulful (as he smokes). and, hey, what is jennifer aniston doing there? oh, she's not really in it enough for anyone to care about her. (but she likes to smoke).this is a waste of anyone's time. i don't even know how i was able to sit through as much of the movie as i did. i can't even believe i spent the time to write this, except to warn others of its banality. anyone need a cigarette?

i walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins. i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder.as soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, i sensed something was wrong and it wasn't long before i to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment. i'm not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature, but this one suffered from a catalogue of bad directing, bad acting (bar 'bruno' character & the impeccable jean rochefort -according to my friends),awful editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time . the worst crime was its overall insipidness and unbelievability (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). why was it so awful? i do not want to waste more of my time explaining. i'd say go and see it for yourself but i don't want to fill the coffers of this project any more than necessary. oh, the screening did possess one redeeming feature: my friend cambering over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself -more pathos, tension & entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 mins of this sadly dire effort.

sorry, but i usually love french thrillers - e.g. chabrol - but this was a glossy shambolic mess. the fact that it was based on a harlan cohen book is telling, because rather than being a french film (strong on psychology and character), it's more like a john grisham-esquire roller-coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists, flashbacks that update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!') and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies. by the end i was laughing hysterically at the unevenness of the film's tone (the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two streetwise shady characters are unintentionally hilarious), the utterly baffling plot, the absurd coincidences and strokes of good fortune (e.g. guessing the password for an email account) and yawning uncontrollably (thought i must have misread the 1hr 50min running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes).

first off, if you want to make a good film, don't cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes. the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours, only to have margo's father explain everything to alex very late in the film. to make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved, but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about (involving alex's father!).there's some serious motivation issues with characters also. margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over. why didn't he just kill philippe's father and be done with it? instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted, but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who gets murdered by philippe's father's thugs). although alex is a doctor (whom one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, during which he not only endangers his own life, but those whom he involves in a nasty pile-up on the freeway. why was margo's friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo, once all the crap hits the fan for alex? and are we to think that margo's father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison? what about his wife? did he consider her wishes? those are some of the main problems.then there are some nasty details, like: why was her father there the night of her faked death? how did he get a hold of the junkie's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two? alex's friend bruno seems over-eager to be part of the mayhem, in which he and his friends have to kill for alex, notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son's life. what good would the photos of margo do? they don't implicate philippe at all. and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her would-be abductors to take? did i miss some other things? probably. minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor, he smokes like a fiend. which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive. also, when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer, neither of them is wearing a seat belt. how bright could they be?

according to most people i know that saw this film and to the reviews i've read this was supposed to be a hugely entertaining thriller that oh so needs to be seen by more people. i didn't expect this film to blow me away but i certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre at best, which is what it is.i'm no stranger to french films being both french and having studied them as a student so i'm aware of the clichés and corny plot twists that can go unnoticed by english/american audiences. there are some great french films that should have been given widespread international release but this isn't one of them.to begin with the plot is both far fetched, over complicated and too smart assed to be entertaining so you really feel every minute of its 2hr and 5min run time and by the time everything is finally revealed you are beyond caring. the main character himself is lacking any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime close to the crap ending so by the time you've even considered swallowing the main plot twists it's begun to dawn on you that you've wasted your time! i actually remember switching off before the credits actually began to roll after the film's climactic reunion - that was the point in which i was sure i had almost completely wasted my time by the way.the film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated. for instance i read somewhere that it beats all the bourne identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has 'wall-to-wall tension'. i can safely say some people are hyping up this frankly dull movie.4/10 is a generously considerate rating for this film i feel, and since i have seen some complete and utter stinkers, i'll therefore save the 1s, 2s and 3s for them.

martha plimpton has done some prestigious movies, working with river phoenix and harrison ford, but she was never able to expand her limited, tomboyish appeal into the same class as, say, molly ringwald. this film, which was barely released, is just an extension of her late '80s/early '90s attempts to find a screen-persona which was identifiable to moviegoers, and it represents another failure. plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and--worse than that--was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep! she sets out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to (would simple curiosity give her this much determination?). unattractive material given sitcom handling; it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. plimpton gives a sour, surly performance, but hector elizondo and mary kay place are fine as her adoptive parents. *1/2 from ****

let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not plan nine or cat women. it is bad, period! the performances vary from drama school theatrics (marla english) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (tom conway). the photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. the real problem, however, is the aimless, pointless, nearly plot less story and the leaden, paceless direction. at a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless.the screenplay is especially inept. there are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. tom conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which he can control telepathically. he is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working, in the expectation of gold and jewels. when they finally arrive, tom conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. she is turned into a monster, kills conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. she sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. the white hunter rescues the wife. in the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!).the aip producer, samuel z arkoff, in a lecture included on the dvd, prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. however, it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. what appeal do they think it could possibly have? the monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. the jungle action is tepid and tedious. there are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with.the producers exposed 77 minutes of film, but they didn't make a movie. this is a con trick and arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.

this 1950's howler is so bad it's unintentionally funny. tom conway portrays dr. gerard, a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo. his poor wife, played by mary ellen kay, is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. along comes marla english as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. her idiot boyfriend, portrayed by lance fuller, is along on the safari. they hire "touch" connors, (later renamed mike connors, of mannix fame) as a guide. english is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either. "touch" (i'm sorry, i can't even type the name without cracking up, i mean, what the...) gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that's saying a lot. the monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. i would say this movie falls into the "it's so bad, it's almost good" category of movies. it's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube.

let's face it, this is a pretty bad film.however if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience.okay, you'll scream in agony a lot.african jungle fun in a dopey kind of way.tom conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau) is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being.it looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress.ugly is being kind.but it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject.he needs a bad bad girl.marla english and lance fuller are two petty crooks in search of african gold.acting lessons for ms english should have been at the top of the search list.she's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.mike "touch" connors is the white guide english & fuller con into leading the expedition.english & conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell.she is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.you will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.what made this movie interesting for me was conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.truly bad cinema.

i only came here to check terror hospital for an alternate title so i'd know what not to pick up. not only do i get the original title, but i come to find terror hospital is one of seven more aliases.this one is a real clunker. movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons, mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment, mostly amusement. this has none of that. instead, the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room, and all this is half of the film. forget trying to figure out where anybody is (or who they are) during darkened or nighttime scenes, too; you probably won't care, anyway. there is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old driver's ed movies i slep... er, i mean sat through and watched way back in high school. really, we're talking about mysticism, possession, and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for trash cinema. unfortunately, there's nothing here to make it even "good" trash; when joined to the aforementioned, the bad acting and not-so-special effects are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effects. this one's just trash, pure and simple. leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale. there's a reason its there...

this is a hard film to rate. while it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two), for an al adamson film, it's exceptional--and practically adamson's very best. that's because unlike many adamson films, there are times when nurse sherri almost looks competent. but, being an adamson film, you know that sooner or later that crappiness must rear its ugly head! the film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. however, in the process, the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital. he apparently dies, but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film. in other words, when you see the film, he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that he'd died. because the guy is the b.f.f. of satan, however, his evil soul can't die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess nurse sherri.now, sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady--demonic possession or not. at times she acts like a zombie and at others she's violently homicidal. so i ask..."why didn't her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was, perhaps, problematic?!". in other words, after trying to kill a patient, he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! oh, and speaking of boobies...this movie is not the breast-filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate. while there are a few bare breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all but one scene. so, if you are a perv, this movie is not for you--though a few places in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film might have, at one time, been designed as a porn flick.if you are a bad movie fan, however, there is enough to whet your appetite. some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren't zombie-like--and i am not even talking about sherri. especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--i have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes ed wood's films! there are also a few more cheap touches, such as the bad animation of the "green stuff", the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (i'd get a cop...better yet, an army of cops).so despite these problems, why do i think it's good for an adamson film? well, the story isn't all bad and he was able to build tension very well. many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit. also, the car crash, while irrelevant, came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for adamson.overall, not a good film and one most people would be bored watching. however, fans of adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs.

i haven't laughed so much in a theater in years. the only problem is that it was not the intent of the movie to make my throat raw from laughter.this movie is absolutely overflowing with bad cgi, absolutely terrible duologue, absolutely terrible *acting*, and enough geek references to make the whole thing come off as nothing but complete cheese.as a gamer and a geek-type girl myself, i did recognize all of the obvious game references in this movie as well as the geek stuff that was just thrown into the background as eye candy (the steamboy poster, the t-shirts from thinkgeek.com and j-list.com), and that didn't redeem the movie at all.the only thing that might have been good at all were the ghost children type characters that were purposefully badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from a game, and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror movies.to be honest, it was hilariously bad, and something i'd expect from a midnight showing of a made-for-tv b grade sci-fi channel movie. don't expect more than that and you'll have a great time. just don't get a soda or you'll spit it everywhere when you get great lines like: "why did you bring that game into our lives?! why?!"

a group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but once they start playing it, they each start dying just like they do in the video game. as they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to beat the game's central villain, the blood countess, before she kills them all.the premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining. however, this "horror" movie is not scary at all. it's actually more of a comedy than anything else. the film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch. sure, there is the occasional laugh but for the most part, the film is very dull. pg-13 horror films can still be good like the ring or cry wolf. the ring and stay alive aren't really the same type of horror film though. stay alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated pg-13, the death scenes are very tame. it should have been the movie's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good. unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered.the acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances. jon foster is not a very good leading man. he lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him. his character isn't unlikable just very bland. samaire armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out. frankie muniz probably gives the best performance in stay alive. that's an honor on the level of being the best player on the houston texans. sophia bush is absolutely terrible as october. her performance feels so rushed and so fake. the most annoying character in the movie is phineas played by jimmi simpson. his character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die.in fact, most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film. it's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive. the only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. it's a little old but it still kind of works. the film is also really short so it's not too much of a pain to sit through. i wouldn't really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer. the direction is not very good and the screenplay isn't much better. stay alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006. that honor would go to when a stranger calls. stay alive is still a missed opportunity though. in the end, this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf. rating 4/10.

this was probably intended as an "arty" crime thriller, but it fails on both counts - there are few thrills and not enough substance. the plodding pacing makes it hard to sit through, and the occasional action scenes are too sloppily edited and confusingly staged to offer much compensation. at least the level of acting is high. (**)

this is a great premise for a movie. the overall plot is very original,interesting, and something to think about. however poor production, an obviously small budget, crapy acting from the main character, and several side actors really detract from this would be classic. an up and coming producer should try to resurect this story and give this basicly half hearted atempt a proper release.

this movie had an interesting enough plot about clones and organ usage, but it fails as the lead actor is so annoying and whiny you want him dead. not that anyone else is very good in it either, but when you hate the character that is supposed to be garnering your sympathy the movie just fails to work. funny enough, it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that mirrors this one with more action and a better cast, still though i won't be able to think of anything else, but this film if i were to watch it. this movie has a super dumb clone that is somehow smart enough to figure something is wrong with his camp where people bicycle at one mile per hour and wrestle for no reason. the counselors tell them that when they are ready they go to america, but our "hero" has his doubts so he snoops around and learns the awful truth which sends him on the run from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly. he goes on the look out for the man he was cloned from. peter graves is in it and so is dick seargent, but they add nothing to this movie which looks like something that was made for television. on the plus side though when "the island" comes out the makers of this film can proudly say "we thought of it first".

the beginning of this movie had me doubting that it would be little more than a typical b sci-fi flick. but, as it progressed i began to get interested and i saw the whole thing through. the premise is interesting, original, and has the makings of making a classic. alas, it instead ended up a mediocre movie, done in by the usual factors which turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad acting, low budget etc.). i'm interested to see how this would turn out if it were remade with good actors and a big hollywood budget.

i bought this on vhs as "terror hospital", and when i got home i checked imdb and was like omg it's the legendary "nurse sherri"!!! so here's another one from al adamson, who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the "blood of dracula's castle" days. where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump, this one mixes it up a little, adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence. sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind, or nurse sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork, or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene, or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever, or god knows what else (i forget, to be honest). as dumb-ass pieces of sh*t go, this one runs toward the high end. congrats, al.

the film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. reanhauer(bill roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power, and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse sherri(..big-chested jill jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such harm, sherri's host body murders selected victims. fortunately, sherri's fellow co-worker, nurse tara(marilyn joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient, marcus washington(prentiss moulden), once a star football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. through marcus' knowledge, passed down from mom, tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly. meanwhile, sherri's lover, dr. peter desmond(geoffrey land)worries about her present condition and welfare.well, this was my first al adamson film and i must agree with his detractors that, just from this film alone, it seems he holds them together with paper clips and elmer's glue. the animation with which we see the spirit take control of sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable. a little soft-core nonsense as filler, some demonic possession thrown in the mix(sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with naughty nurse behavior(..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. the film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. the sexual situations aren't that hard-core and al often shoots them without revealing all that much. the film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills, although the chilling score(..which sounds like something from dark shadows)does help a little bit. jacobson and mary kay pass(..as nurse beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). overall, the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). john f goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with peter over her. i watched the unrated "lost" version which i guess is the real version to watch of nurse sherri.

although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas, seeing this film left me a little short.it had promise, the characters and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they did, yet the story seemed not to understand the direction it wanted to take.the comparisions and parallels within the story, especially the three generations of women in the family, had a lot of potential, but somehow didn't fully extend itself. it could have made the film much easier to relate to and attach to which is the aim of any film about lost-love and life regained.imho, i think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the writing, although harry connick jnr and sandra bullock did try desperatly to breath a little life into otherwise flat character outlines.it's not that this is a bad film, some parts leave you understanding the reasons for various plot developments, its just that this film is underdone, and a little flat overall.

i didn't like watching ds9 compared to other star treks even enterprise, but i didn't like babylon 5, and now i know why. they are the same show. i just read the old news that paramount stole the idea from the creator of babylon 5, but they chose not to sue for a reason i don't know or care, but seeing as a star trek series is based off another even nerdier show is just to much to bare, now i will condemn anyone who even mentions the ds9 when talking about the series. original, tng, and voyager are my favorites in that order. before i didn't understand why everyone thinks ds9 is great and i didn't, but know i know. it's also because the captain has a real anger problem, and i hate people that act cool, but freak out, out of no where; and he seems to on every episode.

some people like to tell you that deep space 9 is the best of all the star trek shows, because it stresses character development and continuity, and features a more complex background and ongoing plots. in some ways this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show fails entirely.the series starts out as a soap opera on a space station, with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters. the characters are a good bunch, and most of the actors are decent, but i think the writers tried too hard to make them "normal". by "normal" they actually mean "ordinary and tedious".at the end of season two we are introduced to the dominion, who hang around menacingly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in season five. this is the main "story arc" of the show, but it only takes up a fraction of the entire series. we still get lame stand-alone episodes, heroes still get stranded on weird planets for forty-five minutes, and there's an awful lot of low-brow comedy featuring the greedy, goofy ferengi. a lot of episodes are merely dull, and some are unwatchable.the dominion, ds9's main villains, are bent on galactic domination for the convenient reason that, well, they just don't like anyone. the entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. impressively pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from season three onwards, but these are carried out in ludicrously simplistic ways, such as two huge fleets of super-advanced starships flying right at each other and blasting away. the writers of ds9 (including the talented ronald d. moore, later of "battlestar galactica" fame) spiced up their monotonous show by starting a war, but at heart it is still a pedantic soap.ds9 remains a very frustrating experience. the continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping, and the characters never truly develop in interesting ways. "babylon 5" and "battlestar galactica" both fulfilled the promise made by ds9, and did everything much better. for star trek, stick with the original and the next generation.

i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend..john was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great with no shirt on!! i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters. savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her. she said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard - he was the one a million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters!!! she didn't have it hard, she had family & money and he had a tour of duty!! i was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart. i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms.

the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because channing tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch. usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time, i didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all. i'm no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see channing tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it (not that his acting was any good) i would have stopped watching much quicker. it's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker. .. if you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in...give this one a miss!!

i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in "dear john," but it was very slow moving; and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. ironically, i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter. i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very "hang-dog" series of expressions in response to loss.

this movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, nicholas sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as the notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in mcadams and gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of channing tatumi felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, amanda seyfried given a great performance only to have tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.this story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. tatum should stick to what hes good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like gi joe, step up, and fighting. the less he talks the better.try not to think of me as a jaded hater of channing tatum i went in to this movie with an open mind, because i've been surprised many a time by the likes of adam sandler in reign over me. i gave the same chance to tatum i didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown

having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie. i read the book again. it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books. what i think what makes the story is the relationships. that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (tim's and alan's characters). the movie didn't at all capture john and savannah's relationship. maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie, but i thought it was so dull compared to the book. i thought channing was a great pick for john,but i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so i think it was more geared towards them. the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that. i was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story i was expecting to see.

yeesh,talk about craptastic.this thing is brutal.horrible voice dubbing,even more horrible acting and no discernible plot.apparently there are some great chase scenes,but the problem is,you have to get to that point first,and i just couldn't.the 20 or so minutes i endured felt more like a root canal than a movie.i suppose i could have fast forwarded it,and i recommend you do the same,unless you have very extreme pain tolerance or your a masochist.i don't fall into either category.i still have a migraine from this thing so i'm about to perform some dental surgery without anesthetic just relive the migraine.bottom line,horrendous. 0/10

when i heard disney had the rights to "underdog",i figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar partnership affair,and we'd get a great adults & kids film like "the incredibles". alas...i forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for today's dumbed down youth. what were they thinking? "underdog" was a product of the 60's,your prime fanbase is in their 40's and 50's,why would you refocus it to 5 year olds? it should have been done ala "roger rabbit",half animated half real. instead we get characters like riff raff ( a wolf!! ) dumbed into another dog."underdog" can't have an "energy pill",as we're now so "enlightened" it would obviously be a steroid or drugs reference.the only good casting was patrick warburton as "cad" because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version. otherwise,old school "underdog" fans should avoid this like the plague it is. what next? a live action version of "the go-go gophers" disguised as a re-visionist history lesson? ( my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this! )

only three words are really required for this review: piece of crap.if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money. the best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor.yes, they do use all of the names and catch phrases. the even name the dog "shoeshine" (in reference to the dog being "shoeshine boy" in the cartoon). they name the love interest polly, but she isn't miss sweet polly purebred.my wife and son drug me to see this. they should have drugged me to see it.the original underdog was voiced by wally cox, the ultimate nerd. this one is voiced by someone with a "smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults" attitude.as a stand alone movie, it is awful. as an homage to underdog, it is even worse. it is not an homage. it is not a retelling of the story. it is not an updating of the story. it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising. the next time i go to the store, i fear that i will see underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothing, etc. mcdonalds and burger king probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this.the worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. they do the underdog theme song to rap (read that with a silent "c" at the beginning)! great, now that we are going to destroy something, let's go all the way.i knew that it would probably be bad before i went. my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating). even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage! save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd. it will be more entertaining and have better production values.

i was browsing through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long so i decided to watch it. i wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful. everything about the movie was cringe worthy. the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns. the jokes were also terrible. i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash. it hit its target audience very well but i don't see how anyone else could enjoy this film. it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it.the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1/10 after viewing it. i beg you to avoid it at all costs. i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all.

i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march, i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly. sure it was a cheesy idea, but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work, hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it? then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck, the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible, but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good. still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today, as i entered my screen i was mortified, it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen! little did i know for what i was about to endure. underdog to put it blunt is horrendous, it really is. imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse, that is just how pathetic the movie is. while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie. matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre, the acting is generally poor, and the movie just feels like an over-long, tired and downright boring saturday cartoon! after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale. i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released, it's an embarrassment to disney, hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this! what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel!so lets get onto the acting (cracks knuckles). okay let me be honest jason lee is decent, his voice suits the canine, and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work. however, with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder. in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield, murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable. then we get onto the human actors, and well the majority of atrocious. alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog, jack. my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition. the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor. not once did i believe he was a real person, in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie! james belushi seems half dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines, he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot, which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable. thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie, he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role. he steals every scene he is in, although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton. the rest of the cast are even worse, especially taylor momsen, she just needs to end her acting career right now!underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene. when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong. this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story, alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms. the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers. what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super? the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness, the dog flies, other stuff happens, some stuff gets chucked about, all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening. the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst. when someone says "look its a plane, no its a bird, no its a frog...", yes you read that right, i just wanted to burst into tears there and then. actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point, this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully.overall underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 at this early period, and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie. luckily for underdog, meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse. so in case you didn't get the point of my review, avoid the film at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, just do not see this!

good things out of the way first:underdog's voice acting was fine. but jason lee being awesome himself, that really is no surprise.peter dinklage (barsinister) also did fine, for what trash was given to him. he acted the part shockingly well. and so did patrick warburton, the moronic assistant. now, it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well, i actually liked the character better than the protagonists. the lines given to him were childish but witty.however. alex neuberger did awful and hope he never acts again. his "scream" was so disgustingly fake. silence. silence. "aaahhhhhhh". in the scene where he hears the dog talk, an "oh no, impossible!" would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake scream.and then there was the girl and her female dog that chased patrick's character cad on the roof. at first this makes sense, she's a "reporter." a school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless. but why, why the hell did she carry her dog around? that was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless "oh, underdog!" her presence was extremely unnecessary.overall, the script was pathetic. the only reason i give this movie a 3 is barsinister, his assistance, and underdog's voice.

god, i never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap. there are so many ways to describe this piece of crap, that i think that if i said everything that came to mind, i would get banned by this site.how do i begin? well, for one, it doesn't take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people who've seen it. the biggest butchering of a theme song ever made is here, from a metal version, to a freaking rap version, what were they thinking? how does underdog and a electronic-heavy musical style match? the story is so basic, that i will do something i don't usually do and not even give a summary. just think this: a dog gets superpowers, fill in the rest. that's how predictable this movie is. and then comes the jokes....please kill me now. this style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing, it's that bad, well, expect that punch line after the sneezing. that was slightly funny.but what surprises me the most is why jason lee(ny name is earl), patrick warburton(emperor's new groove), and jim belushi(according to jim) are all here. in the shows/movies i mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job, and, excluding lee, are the best actors in this movie, but that says very little. the rest deserve golden rasberry nominations for this crap. i am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster.all in all, this is just as bad as doogal, which i reviewed as well, and again, my head would explode if i saw anything worse than this.

spoilers, beware!!! flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. some things do confuse me about it (e.g. jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; alex replies "about 25 years," isn't alex supposed to be 18?) and some things do fascinate me about it (i loved the spins!). overall, though, it intrigued me. when this movie was made, i wasn't even born. i didn't really experience the eighties (i was born in '85) and i have to wonder: sometimes alex would just run in place a bit, or throw herself all over, not really dancing, just banging in to things, tossing her head back, and waving her arms-was this considered "dancing" back then? if it was, i'm not sure i could've standed it. the spins, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of it-my neighbor's toddler could've done better! also, if alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? when she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off? living in a warehouse-i can almost see it, but not quite. it doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, and is trying to get into ballet. none of it really makes sense. i shouldn't be too judgemental considering my own background, but please. maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, i don't know. but either way, they could've picked a better actress. the actors were fine. i even liked the romance. you make your own decision. but mine is-rent it once, don't see it again-it isn't worth it.

i registered with imdb.com just so i could comment about this movie. my god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was! it shouldn't even be touted as a real movie, this is very deceiving. this is a 15 year old's film project at best. the acting is terrible. but even good actors could not save this. the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie. who the hell wrote this crap? and that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about kaye being a "damsel in distress" got old real fast. god i'd rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again. do not rent this movie. if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it. smash it with a hammer. even if smashing this video caused you to lose your hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it. this is an abomination. i suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant. any questions....email me.

this movie obviously had good intentions. at the end there is a dedication to someone named kellie who, as a viewer, i can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts. perhaps she made the "wrong" choice. that dedication is the only redeeming quality of love & suicide.the movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film, it's pretty much going to be downhill after that...which it was. i know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good...unfortunately, everything else was horrid. the acting, the plot, the sound quality, the picture quality...the acting. i'm sorry but the acting is horrible. beyond horrible. it's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting. that's the only way i can think to describe it. as i watched, i actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind. none of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit. in short: the timing is way off. the timing of the entire film is way off. i'm no director so i know the limits of my knowledge but i really feel there had to be some way to convey the passing of time...until they explained about graduation not being too far away i was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week...a month at most.all that being said, it's really a shame. this movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking. all the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set-up is obvious (which is a bad thing). the moving scenes totally fell flat. for instance, when kaye's brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers, we should feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brother...somehow it just doesn't come off that way. there are so many more scenes like this (for example: all of the fight scenes) and all they do is take away from the movie. all these things put together, love & suicide comes off as one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.

my friend and i rented this movie for 3.99 at blockbuster. if i'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be, i wouldn't have paid a cent. i had no warning for this bs. the acting can't even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is awkward, and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the male villain... god, who couldn't tell he was going to attack emily and the musical cues... my lord. this movie makes me want to cry. never rent this. in fact, if you happen to look upon it, gauge out your eyeballs. this movie isn't of god- it's from hell. i'm just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah shiz cause i really don't want to continue on with this review.

i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on.so, imagine my delight when i discovered love & suicide while browsing netflix. echoing heavenly creatures, an easy choice, to the top of my queue it went.i watched it last, made myself comfy, and waited. what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student's prank film project (i laughed out loud once or twice, thinking "that just lowered the bar of straight to video") turned out to be the movie. horrible acting, amateur direction, weak dialog. i usually enjoy low budget films, there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the "meat" the acting, the direction, the plot, the story. i would liken it to a student who hasn't studied for an exam goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleeps.in someone else's hands the plot would have serious potential.do not expect magic or even a cult classics like, say, divine's polyester, or showgirls, at least there you learn to expect bad acting.love & suicide went from bad, to worse, to the worst movie i have ever seen.

ok, i don't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie. just the way the scenes were edited and the acting, it made me cringe at some points. i really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film, they must have had the smallest budget. i really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful. also, why is it that in almost every film with lesbian characters one of them has to either commit suicide or die or turn straight?!?! this is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. i gave it 3 stars and everything considered i think that was very kind of me. only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad it is.

yeah, i made it all the way to the end. it was pretty hard though.sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set. the acting...well, i don't even know what to say. i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring, sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog. i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100-minute-long audition tape. i'm not even going to talk about the ending...the best thing about the movie was the music.that being said, i do not recommend this movie to anyone. even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch overall, this is nothing to waste your time on. if you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, check out the children's hour, lost and delirious or high art. those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won't have to suffer cinematic hell in the process.

this movie has good intentions, at least in the message "don't be afraid, no matter how tough it can be. fear will kill you in the end" it's a good message, but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting, complete lack of credibility in the feelings, dialog that's delivered as if it were read out loud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people.it abuses from effects such as slow-motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus, a lack of emotional force...the suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low-budget film from the pre-90s, when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) an utter incapacity of live good, happy lives, and a tendency to get caught in over-the-top dramas that often involved separation, death, or prison. had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it (and not according to how others think we should live it), it would have being less dramatic, more inspiring. but it doesn't, it focuses of pain, on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal.i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection. if you're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel, go back to the magnificent "desert hearts" (even better: read the novel!)

nico mastorakis's banned movie was quite disappointing in my opinion. the movie is about a couple, who go to a greek island to kill of all perverted people (apparently). you know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off.but things only get worse from that point as all scenes pretty much look alike. they meet some people, so they either kill or have sex with them (preferably both).the ending is ok allright when the couple turn out to be brother and sister and she is just letting him rot somewhere but overall one would have expected more. no substance here i'm afraid.3/10.

kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys. throughout the movie, you get to meet several of her loser boyfriends. and throughout the movie, you are subjected to kate's cynical negative outlook on love and relationships. this negative viewpoint is continued throughout and presented as ultimate truth. i had a real problem with this. why would anyone want to be taught about love, life, and dating from someone who is obviously so messed up? it would work if that was the joke, but it is not. for the jokes in the movie (which are neither funny nor original) to work at all, you have to believe what kate is saying: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex, that the highest level a relationship can evolve to is when you are able to fart in front of your partner... you get the idea.there is no movie in recent memory that comes close to upsetting the stomach as much as love & sex. why did the filmmakers waste their time on such trash? every joke in love & sex is something that i have experienced in another movie or in my own life. there is nothing original or creative about the story, the production, or the style. it is cynical, dumb and pointless. mind numbing!

to keep from being bored during "love and sex," first i tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of: "breaking up" with russell crowe and salma hayek (though that had a more original ending), "about last night" with rob lowe, and a lot of tv shows. second was admiring just how gorgeous framke janssen is so i couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. she is certainly in line to give julia roberts a run for her money, literally-- and wasn't julia in some movie with this same plot or other? third was trying to figure out why the writer/director bothered to give jon favreau's character the jewish name of adam levy; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why i was in the theater.(originally written 9/2/2000)

this movie is by far one of the worst b-movies i have ever seen. there are no plot twists at all. though the acting is decent, the storyline is terrible. there are also many mistakes in the movie, and it was bothersome to watch. for any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies, or even b-movies, i don't recommend this to anyone at all. most of the movie is focused on pointless killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing. this movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of jeepers creepers, which, too, wasn't that great of a movie. for anyone who wishes to spend a day at home, watching poorly made movies, this one takes the cake.

the acting was very sub-par, you had costas mandalar acting like triple h's dumber forest ranger brother, a scott mcmahon look-alike as his depute who i guess your supposed to care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. you have the stupid lesbian, not that i have any thing against lesbians, i don't just stupid ones who keep running around in a punisher like shirt and a grunge like hat who keeps asking if anyone saw her dead lover.the villain could be scary and there is a morality tale somewhere about trying to fight age and death but it is lost in this movie. costas hurst helmsley points out to the soon to be victims the way back into town, while obviously there are city lights behind him.also a mispronunciation of ed gein but pronounced it gine. as a citizen of wisconsin. we have had our share of monsters gein,dahmer, and mccarthy, but if your going to use it pronounce it right.god why do i watch all these terrible films. oh yes i am a glutton for punishment and i watch these so you don't have to.

dr. chopper starts shortly after teenager nicholas' (robert adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining & in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake tatonka the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about. so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica (chelsey crisp) & three friends, jimmy (butch hansen), reese (chase hoyt) & tamara (ashley mccarthy) head out there for a fun weekend. unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed & their neighbours turn out to be dr. chopper (ed brigadier) & his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments...going straight-to-video/dvd dr. chopper was edited & directed by lewis schoenburn & this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews, while i think dr. chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i don't think some of the criticism i've read is entirely justified. the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt (whether he likes it or not...) who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i can't remember any character of that name, maybe he was one of the cops at the start? anyway, the basic story is alright i suppose although it's a tad dull & lasts for too long, it's typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast, you know the drill by now. besides some brief & undeveloped nonsense about dr. chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there's not much story here & the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off, there's the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. oh, & when i say topless i mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in dr. chopper at all. so there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clichéd dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i'm just being picky.director schoenburn does ok actually, this is by no means the worst looking film i've seen although it still looks cheap. there's no style here, i didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. the gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. dr. chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. the acting is alright, it could have better but i've certainly seen worse.dr. chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.

i got this in the horror six-pack from echo bridge home entertainment. this one is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. in fact, this movie sucked so hard, i don't know how i'm gonna write this review, especially since 1. i popped it out of the dvd player because i couldn't even watch another second and 2. hurricane friggin' ike is coming and god knows how long 'til it take for me to get this review done. the movie starts off with a scientist and his wife. the scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this supposedly urban legend known as the skeleton man kills him, and later on his wife. then... i'm sorry, but there's really not much else i can say about this pos except don't bother. i'm currently using the disc as a coaster, and if you see this, you might want to do the same. casper van dien and michael rooker must have needed cash...badly! ps. i'll pretty much be reviewing the movies in the boxset and might do a new review on ghoulies iv.

skeleton man was okay for the first 5 minutes but as soon as the so-called "special force agents" hit the screen, it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a sled.the opening makes us think we might have a corny, yet fun, horror flick on our hands but no...the film makers ruin any hope of that when the "special force agents" show up. i wish the screenwriter took a different route and had the "skeleton man" chase down some dim witted teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand. instead, the "skeleton man" chases down some dim witted "special force agents" and offs them until their captain finally gets the upper hand.i know the whole "stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer" thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like this.when the "skeleton man" finally does meet his "so called" demise, in a building that blows up, the captain of the "special force agents" is asked the following by a police officer outside of the building: "what the hell happened in there?" my answer to that question: "who the hell cares?"

ok i have seen hershall gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake,its really gory and gross,not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in,i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet,the only saving grace is the late great henny youngman as the strip club owner,yeah take my wife..., please.the stripteasers are real sexy for 1972,i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie;stripped to kill in 1987.i did enjoy the earlier h.g.lewis flick 100 maniacs,which was a mini masterpiece of sorts,but bad acting,no awards here,but be aware this is a splatter movie that paved the way for friday the 13th,and saw.in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt spanked with a meat tenderizer.ugh!morbid stuff here.h.g. lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.

this movie is not a remake of she's all that ( 1999)?where is the renewal of the american movie? this was probably the worst movie i saw in the last 5 years. this and the last movies of schwarzenegger.

of course, all this nonsense begs the question 'does a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie?' the woeful 'scary movie' (i and ii) took the formula about as far as it could go - 'not another teen movie' really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add.the plot, essentially based on fairyfloss teenflic 'she's all that', walks a shaky line between parody and homage ('john hughes high school'). everything from 'american beauty' to 'varsity blues' is mined for references. the result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience. the downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of 'she's all that' is that we all know where its going anyway. and if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless.there's extremely little to recommend here. the token gross-out scene (an erupting toilet) seems badly out of place here amongst all the 'feel-good' references. there are moments of humour - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way. it stinks, don't watch it.

"red sonja" is flawed, weak and lacking. even the camp-ness isn't good.there are only two good things about "red sonja"; the costumes (even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous. it's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men, because she was raped, still choose to wear so few little clothes, even when it rains.) and the music by ennio morricone. still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable.the story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting. the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely.brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady. i don't know who's accent is worse; hers or arnie's and on top of that; she can't act. there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag. ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role, but my god he looked horrible, he changed so much since his (only well known) role in "raiders of the lost ark". maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991? and by the way, what was with all those "raiders of the lost ark" actors in this movie? next to ronald lacey, pat roach, terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like some kind of "raiders of the lost ark" reunion.the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword)fights even though some of them are needless and weak.only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy-genre.4/10

red sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong-direction for arnold schwarzenegger. having made a couple of sword 'n' sorcery films (as conan) he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like the terminator and commando, only to make a mystifying return to the sword 'n' sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle. it's hard to figure out why he bothered, as this is weaker than both conan films in every conceivable department. allegedly, this was to have been the third conan film, but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character, the titular red-head, leaving poor old arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role. spare a thought, too, for director richard fleischer who had given the world classics like 20,000 leagues under the sea, fantastic voyage, the boston strangler and 10 rillington place. in this - his penultimate film - fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards.evil queen gedren (sandahl bergman) wants to rule the world, and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so. she and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman, massacring the helpless priestesses as they go. one of the dead priestesses has a sister named sonja (brigitte nielsen), a fiery red-headed warrior, who upon hearing of her sister's death swears revenge upon the evil gedren. sonja rides across the land in search of gedren's lair. along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince, tarn (ernie reyes jr) and his bodyguard falkon (paul smith). she also meets the muscular warrior conan - sorry, i mean kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. initially sonja doesn't want the help of kalidor (arnold schwarzenegger), preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance.red sonja is a staggeringly poor film, all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword 'n' sorcery genre was close to its end. it seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind. the performances are poor on the whole, ranging from bergman's embarrassingly ott villain to reyes' unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to schwarzenegger's wooden and unenthusiastic hero. nielsen is slightly better as the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role - but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of clive exton and george macdonald fraser's script. the film is riddled with goofs, including a scene where schwarzenegger is seen in close-up hacking down bad guys but in a long-shot in the same sequence there isn't a corpse in sight. technically it is very inept too, with sub-standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters. there are a few compensations, such as ennio morricone's enjoyable music (morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films, e.g the island, treasure of the four crowns and hundra). another compensation is giuseppe rotunno's lensing of the locations - in fact, much of the time it's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground! there were very few sword 'n' sorcery films after red sonja, so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre.

it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own, and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery.actually, this isn't as bad as some critics say, but it isn't good, either. it is amusing, and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line, making it a conflicted, uneven, poor work. and speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, due to the era in which this was filmed, but that is not the only reason.the story herein is inferior, even to the conan line, but moreover, it loses itself in the "red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger" ploy, and entirely forgets its purpose, if it ever had one.it's entertaining, but in a low-budget, guilty-pleasure "b" kind of way.it rates a 4.2/10 from...the fiend :.

sometimes intentionally campy, at other times unintentionally silly (like in the opening scene, where a woman is "informed" that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered, just for the sake of exposition), this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough (as a straightforward adventure story) to be really enjoyable. i'll leave you to decide which may be the highlight, but the low point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon. brigitte nielsen was a good choice for sonja, with her fresh face and her firm, slightly muscular body (and i think that her dark-red hair suits her perfectly), but schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances as calidor. (*1/2)

have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on dvdit comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan movies.unfortunately, this film didn't appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects aren't as flash and some scenes seem hurried. nielsen is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldn't act if a gun was put to her head. arnie's supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director fleischer, who also directed conan the destroyer. maybe arnie wasn't confident that he would go on to headline films like predator, total recall, t2, etc.some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film. i couldn't be so jovial if i was fighting for my life.all this aside, this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining. i've seen a lot worse. two stars.

in the mid-1970s, my nyc apt. building was finally wired for cable-tv and since showtime (instead of hbo) was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies, i signed up for it. being a writer and night-owl by nature, i soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning i'd never even heard of--most of them american independent films and foreign films that had never been given a u.s. theatrical release. many of them had recognizable "star" casts and respectable directors, and thanks to showtime, i discovered many first-rate films i (and other showtime subscribers) would never else have had the opportunity to see. most of these cinematic mongrels were indeed "dogs" but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious. one night, showtime unveiled a little italian-made gem called "redneck" (filmed in 1972, given a limited european release in 1973). even though the movie had never been released in the u.s., the mpaa rating was listed as an 'r'. since the director was one sylvio narizzano (the director who made his name with the glorious "georgy girl"), and the three leads were mark ("oliver") lester, fabio testi and telly savalas, i decided to give it a try. and found myself nailed to my tv screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. as i recall, savalas and testi played two criminals, the former a raging maniac who, in one stomach-churning scene, casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff, thereby plunging to the wilderness depths below. so far, so bad. then, out of nowhere, testi (as the "nice" psycho) and lester (all of 14 when the movie was made) are seen, both nude, in a men's room, testi sneaking peeks at the kid's body while shaving, and poor confused lester fixated on close-ups of testi's naked butt. as a not-yet-jaded member of the movie industry, and a card-carrying liberal (i was as much against censorship then as i am today), the entire movie made me queasy (and, being the early '70s when i thoughti'd seen everything in the anything-goes movies of that liberated era--including the uncut version of altman's "that cold day in the park", a real jaw-dropper until it was trimmed for an 'r' rating and would have spelled the end for altman's career had he not next come up with something called "m*a*s*h"), i still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw "redneck" and was appalled as i was. trashing the actors and movie-going audiences is joy maladjusted filmmakers have been merrily indulging in since the beginning of time. but leeringly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor (mr. lester) at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor (and i'm sure his film offers had thereby dwindled to meretricious junk like "redneck")...mr. narizzano, you should be hanging your head in shame. (incidentally, i was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in narizzano's future, undistinguished efforts. they both despised him. surprise?)

sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film in decades, and his memory is appalling. his attempts to paint the mark lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous, as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy "sneaking peeks at the kid's body". lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a glance.the scene is a crude attempt to show lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body.like everything in this film, it's badly done, but nothing more.even sdiner82's comments about savalas' character who "casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff" is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead, and she was in a car).i suggest that sdiner82's review says far, far more about his own, far from liberal mindset, than it does about this valueless film.the only reason i even bothered to look it up, was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after kojak.the film is a worthless piece of 70's trash, but sdiner82's review of it is the worst kind of slander. he wraps up his review in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every "factual" matter he discusses.i can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he looked for, which is disturbing. now he can return to burning copies of catcher in the rye.

i know a lot of people would claim certain films as 'the worst of all time' but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize. a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly savales and plot progression that defies belief.on telly saveles: was he drunk when he acted in this? he seems to play a slurring, laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction. maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, i don't know.on mark lester: a performance more wooden than a carpenter's workshop. his clipped british tones don't belong in this film; and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangster's apprentice in 24 hours is mad. and the strip scene with mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all; perhaps the director likes this sort of thing.plot logic: when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why doesn't mark lester's mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loonies drive it off? she just lets them all go, without saying a word!! on the other hand, redneck has to be seen - you won't believe how bad it is otherwise!

definitely not your typical polizia, redneck just never worked for me. the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process. in their attempt to get away, the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy. the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them. while i could cite a number of problems i had with the movie, i'll focus on the most obvious  the character memphis played by telly savalas. from his work in the dirty dozen and kelley's heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as kojak, savalas was a winner. i've always thought of him as one uber-cool customer. unfortunately, savalas is almost unwatchable in redneck. did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible? it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about, but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre. it's appears to be random lunacy. and what's with that accent? savalas might have been a lot of things, but southern isn't one of them. he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent. beyond that, i found little of interest in the rest of the movie. as i indicated, the plot never drew me in. i just didn't care about what was going on. and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesn't ring true. as for the other actors, mark lester is almost as bad as savalas and the usually reliable franco nero isn't a whole lot better. three "name" actors and not a good performance between them. to make matters worse, i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots. i couldn't tell what was going on. characters i hate, a plot i don't care about, and a production values that failed  little wonder i've given redneck a 3/10.

terrible direction from an awful script. even the dvd looked muddy and out of focus. laughable accents all over the map. unlike most of the other commenters i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud, but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn-out shots of nude or scantily-clad young men, usually wet or glistening with sweat, looking longingly at each other.

close but no cigar! - that's what my opinion of this film is! tag purvis both wrote and directed this script which should have gone through a re write before shooting. at times, laughable because or a corny script, this film's shining star is dan mongomery jr and the director of photography. both of these talents are ones to watch out for in the future. my recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and use the rental money on a classic!

i think purvis starts out to do a gay "gone with the wind" if so, sorry, tag, it didn't happen. it also didn't happen as a gay "sexploitation" flick. i guess i'm confused; what are we trying to do here? much as i'd like to, i simply can't get to where i care even a little about these characters. this movie is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence that lives in the south; it does nothing to explain, enlighten or advance my understanding of a gay relationship, or the conflict the protagonist seems to be grappling with.

i don't understand the many good reviews, here. i found the photography and scenery beautiful, and the two lead actors appealing, but there's little else here to recommend this movie. most annoying are the fake southern accents and badly written dialog. these do not sound like real people to me. although it's refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits, most of the story is without motivation or logic. the only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility griffith feels toward his mentally ill aunt, grossly over-acted by karen black. lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear. yes, i understand that he's a drifter, but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all. this movie is worth a look, chiefly because it has a nice atmosphere about it, but it's slow moving and deeply flawed. a serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it, as the premise and story outline are promising.

first of i should point out that i used to love winnie the pooh as a child and i really enjoyed the tigger movie even though i am in my 20's.but this movie was so bad i was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth.ok, ok i know this is a movie for kids and isn't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age.the main downfall in this film is the heffalump itself, it has to be the most annoying character i have seen in a child's movie (possibly even more annoying then the young child in monsters inc). it has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, i know pooh movies aren't exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year old's intelligence!secondly - where was the story? previous pooh outings had a least a point to the story- yes i can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts - but really it ended and i felt like i had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids tv.i don't have children of my own but when i do i fully intend to show them quality children's movies like the tigger movie, toy story and finding nemo (even though they are too childish for me these days i can see how they would be of great appeal to young children). not so with this appalling attempt at a movie.oh and one more thing - not enough eeyore! he should have his own movie!

i saw winnie's heffalump a couple of days ago. a nice story based on well known characters created by a.a.milne. although winnie, piglet, tigger and rabbit are all present in this animated feature, the main character is roo this time. he befriends with scary heffalump who proves to be not scary at all and shows everybody that friendship knows no boundaries and everybody wants and deserves to be happy. i love this film and i would love it even more were i 10 or 15 years younger. alas, i would like to become a kid again to enjoy this heffalump story much more but all i am left with is a sense of sadness at the loss of a sort of childishness and innocence of which this movie is full i was glad to hear carly simon sing, joel mcneely provided great score.

all in all, this is a movie for kids. we saw it tonight and my child loved it. at one point my kid's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible. however, i am a great fan of a.a. milne's books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters. this film was not subtle. it seems a shame that disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages, although perhaps, it doesn't have the permission to use them. i found myself wishing the theater was replaying "winnie-the-pooh and tigger too", instead. the characters voices were very good. i was only really bothered by kanga. the music, however, was twice as loud in parts than the dialog, and incongruous to the film.as for the story, it was a bit preachy and militant in tone. overall, i was disappointed, but i would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face.i liked lumpy's laugh....

very silly high school/teen flick about geeks trying to prove themselves better than the rich brats. sound familiar? this television movie from director rod amateau ("uncommon valour" and some "dukes of hazaard" episodes believe it or not) says nothing, does nothing, and surely will entertain very few.notable for its "who's who" of television cast, including michael j. fox, bob denver ("gilligan"), and todd bridges ("different strokes"). this lame effort barely limps over the line. also stars anthony edwards ("e.r.").saturday, september 5, 1998 - video

final draft - a screenwriter (james van der beek) locks himself into his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. not a terrible premise, but the execution is awful. this feels like a first year direction and writing job, and probably is. the director jump cuts the hell out of everything. it's meant to be disorienting. what it is is annoying. so much so that small chunks of film are incoherent. the writing is predictable, and doesn't use follow through on most of the ideas it offers (bag of oranges). it's like they ran out of time and slap-dashed it together for the toronto film festival.this film is not jaw-droppingly "oh my god it's so bad it's good" bad. it's boring bad, and irritates you for a long time afterward. james van der beek is not a terrible actor, and keeps the ship barely above water. but he's too normal for the kind of psychosis the film tries to offer. he is merely a withdrawn guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, then decides to act mildly deranged. cause follows effect. maybe there's something in the water. now darryn lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. he shares the likeness of chris o'donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman achievement.the atmosphere the film provides is good (dull gray and somber), but as it's the only thing the film achieves it means nothing. this film wants to be jacob's ladder or the machinist. it isn't even secret window. it's the preppy girl in class deciding to turn goth.not irksomely terrible, but the sheer stupidity of it will ebb at you. i've already put more thought into this critique than the filmmakers did for this.d

as with most viewers of this film, i'm an avid reader of the books. the first 2 films have buck, ray and chloe as the main characters but in this the second sequel they play second-fiddle to louis gossett jr's presidential effort. world at war is based on the meeting he has with buck in the book series.the problem is - this film is as awful as the first two. amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play (i won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series). other illogical parts feature. i really really want cloud 10 to make a good left behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2.

i first read about the left behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since i have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world, so imagine my surprise and joy when i found a copy of left behind : world at war in my local library, nestling innocently among the big budget action movies.now as a movie it's extremely poor. the acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the "special effects" would have looked dated in the early 90's. being the third part of a series the story would be unintelligible to anyone who hadn't seen or read about the other left behind movies, and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughable.on the religious front, i don't think anyone who wasn't already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways. how are you supposed to fear the antichrist when he's got a comedy russian accent, and the worst of his powers are some pitiful cgi?however, my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and dupe people into believing that it's a big budget action movie. upon picking up the box and reading the spiel i immediately noticed something odd...nowhere on the packaging was there a mention of the true nature of this film. to someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that left behind : world at war was no different from the latest tom clancey. nor, on the copy that i rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series.considering the whole premise of the series is that the antichrist has deceived the whole world, i find it extremely hypocritical that the film makers tried to deceive me twice before i even got the to counter! if you're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it?the simple fact is, had this not been a "christian" movie with the built in fan base that goes with it, i seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day. if cloud ten were hoping that i'd see the error of my ways and give myself to god, i'm afraid to say i would have died of boredom and/or laughed myself to death before i ever had the chance.

based on the 2007 spy novel by david ignatius, body of lies tells the story of a cia operative roger ferris (dicaprio) who is sent to jordan to track down an al-qaeda mastermind, all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his jordanian hosts and his manipulative american boss ed hoffman (crowe).anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of ferris by hoffman, but the actual story is much more mundane. instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy american ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of amman jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals. only during a scene where ferris takes his new-found iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from jordanian men.compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding. ferris flies to jordan, ferris gets expelled from jordan, ferris flies to washington, ferris flies to the uk, ferris flies back to jordan, hoffman flies to jordan, hoffman returns home to take care of his kids  an on it goes. this is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of the amazing race, not a spy thriller.in body-punishing loyalty to his craft, crowe gained an impressive 63 pounds of flab for the role of portly ed hoffman, thus joining the small select club of actors consisting of robert de niro and christian bale as thespians who've subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles. it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.

after two terrorist attacks in europe, one in london and the other in amsterdam, the prime suspect is the leader al-saleem (alon aboutboul). the cia agent roger ferris (leonardo dicaprio) that operates in the middle east is assigned by his superior at langley ed hoffman (russell crowe) to keep a "safe house" in amman under surveillance, and he associates to the chief of security in jordan, hani salaam (mark strong). roger does not disclose the whole operation to hani, and it fails due to the intervention of ed. meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse aisha (golshifteh farahani) and he gets close to her family. when roger plots another scheme to catch al-saleem using the innocent architect omar sadiki (ali suliman) as decoy to lure al-saleem, he jeopardizes not only the safety of sadiki, but also aisha that is kidnapped. after the execution of sadiki, roger tries to negotiate the release of aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse."body of lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through europe and middle east despite the names of ridley scott, leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe. the imdb user rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology, satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking, but that is not my case. it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. the rich character performed by leonardo dicaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in middle east due to his biotype. but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east. the rescue of roger ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. my vote is four.title (brazil): "rede de mentiras" ("network of lies")

maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. however, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. just what the doctor ordered ... right? how many more of these movies has hollywood made? one thousand? two thousand? the formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. the locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. this movie seemed to run-on interminably. "when will this movie end?" i repeatedly thought to myself. leonardo dicaprio was totally unbelievable as a cia operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight russell crowe plays a cia bureaucrat. please note that in this movie the on site operative is "lean and mean" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. this is called stereotyping. what was the casting director thinking? why not have jack nicholson play an overweight office clerk? or nicole kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? and the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. an obviously non-arab american (mr. dicaprio) trying to pass himself off as an arab ... speaking fluent arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable arab masquerade ... trying to romance a palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. by now you get the point. next time try casting an actual arab in the role. not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. there should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. next stop for this movie - dvd land and oblivion. and one other thing. don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. the pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.

if andrei tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror. this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world, i am convinced. a son, without a name, takes care of his mother, without a name. they love each other, i guess. no, they don't, i'm sure. these aren't characters. they aren't even actors playing characters. at least it could be pretty, but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a macintosh computer. and could sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration? you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10.

the film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. what does it show? it shows their living in very poor conditions. it shows how tenderly they "walk" (really he is bringing her). but what do we see further? after their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. it is not possible. a person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. he would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. another thing. the author devoted this film to andrey tarkovsky. we see he learned many tarkovsky's visual effects. but in sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. someone has compared this film with "mirror" ("zerkalo"). there is nothing common except these visual effects. "mirror" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation.

i loved this movie! it's the finest parody of russian cinema to date. who else but sokurov could lampoon tarkovsky so brilliantly. you thought "stalker" was slow? well, step up to the plate. "mat i syn" makes "stalker" look like "raiders of the lost ark". by no means should you miss this film! there's no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast-forward button on your vcr. sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes.i suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black, silent screen (wasn't this already explored in "in the soup"?).apparently the filmmaker (and fans) have forgotten that "motion" is the first word of "motion picture".!!!major spoilers ahead!!!want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved? here's a step by step guide:1. find a talented photographer.2. find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape (think tuscany!). if you need inspiration, watch some luxury car or perfume commercials.3. shoot about 3 rolls of film.4. photoshop the results to play around with saturation, blur & aspect ratio.5. now just get out your movie camera, film 40 of the best pictures and have your "actors" mumble their lines off-screen. don't worry about writing it ahead of time - just let the actors say whatever they want (lines like "do you want a drink?" and "let's get something to eat" are really all you need to fill up 8 minutes or so). if you can't think of enough dialog - no problem! just have them repeat what they say a few times. if that still isn't enough, just let the camera run anyway.congratulations, another masterpiece! as a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! the static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpeg encoding - a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.

this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia, as she lays dying.i am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. on one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. there is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. the son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that i think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family. it also cruelly reminds me that i could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. "mat i syn" is cruel reality.on the other hand, "mat i syn" moves really too slowly. do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? with my previous experience of "telets" and "aleksandra", i am so tempted to put "mat i syn" among them as a total bore.i guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. i surely see the beauty of it, but maybe i am not in the right state of mind.

"midnight clear" has a great premise. a group of over-educated, overly bright gi's are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the bulge. the gi's encounter a group of battle-weary german regulars, and it becomes clear that they don't want to fight anymore.therein lies the problem. it's really pretty simple. if the germans want to surrender, they do so and that's the end of the movie. if the germans want to fight, they do so and that's also the end of the movie. so instead of doing either the gi's and germans play games with each other, even throwing snowballs at one point. interesting for one or two scenes, but it soon becomes very annoying. after all, these are germans. the enemy. nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot. the film does noting to make them more human. in fact, much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them, including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man! why should i care about such characters? just shoot them and let's move on to the battle of the bulge. it's much more interesting, anyway.one good scene: the gi's are returning from a recon of the german position, where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire. while walking across a clearing, they realize a group of germans have their mausers leveled at them. the germans are about 100 yards away. the gis then do something i've never seen any gi's do in any sillywood movie. they throw down their rifles and throw up their hands! unusual as this may be in films, it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance. though it seems far, in reality it's point-blank range for those rifles. i'll lay odds that someone working on this film was a cruffler!

recap: a band of five young american men, all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the ardenne offensive during the wwii get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity. they're in really bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food. but after a while there is some enemy activity, and it is very odd. not hostile, but odd. it seems like there is a german squad out there, in equally bad condition, that want nothing more than to surrender.comments: based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen. indeed it is a different war movie, much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles. but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall flat in the movie. it is not suspenseful, just different and in many ways absurd. many times people just act insane, and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at.so when this mental pressure fails to come through, the main building piece of the entire story, i thought the story fell through. it wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message. actually it did nothing.the cast is interesting, many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers. the acting is good, but not stellar, and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone. much of that too i feel is due to that this story, these characters need the time, space and pace given in a novel, that they can't be given here. and going halfway definitely isn't good enough.4/10

my father insisted i should watch this film with him and i regret that i wasted my time watching--i want that approximate hour and a half back! the "funny" little film concerns the elderly don ameche staying with his son, tom selleck. it turns out that ameche isn't just "forgetful" like he's been told, but has dementia (it seems a lot like alzheimers). and, because dad is so frequently "out to lunch" he gets into so much trouble again and again--almost like the adorable tyke from baby's day out. the problem, though, is that you know baby's day out is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine. plus, you aren't laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness. but, in this case, you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind--and where's the humor in that?! if this film had been more successful, would the producers have then made films making fun or people with cerebral palsy or a flesh-eating virus?!?! there are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film.

folks! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're going senile and want to be put out of their misery. several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, saving them from his death-traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process. the movie seems to hate its main character, which makes it all the more painful to watch. there's also the usual tacked-on love-interest and predictable ending.this movie was also the first time i'd seen tom selleck without a mustache, and i remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick. but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie.

hunk of trash only the full moon studios could make has a group of college kids, staying for free in an old hospital with no one knowing, as a demonic creature with two faces(barely visible the entire film because of incomprehensible lighting)passes through walls killing each member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient markings. someone amongst them(it won't be too hard to prove, but a slight twist is so uninspiringly revealed and limply executed you'll just scoff)is the mastermind behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone.cheap, badly acted mess has a "that's it?!" kind of weak ending that'll have you exasperated at why you just wasted your time. tanya dempsey, who couldn't act her way through a wet paper sack, has the heroine duties as the newest member of the college rooming bunch named clark. oh, and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks it's next victim.

the creature? yeah, it and the movie it stars in. hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity. six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to "the shadowy world from which it came!" other than having major logic and coherence problems (plus the fact it appears to be unfinished), this disaster is terribly acted, written, edited (by j.r. bookwalter) and directed, and the make-up fx are almost nonexistent. it's also significantly shorter than it claims (at only 80 minutes), but i'm not complaining. it's the worst movie i've seen from executive producer charles band's full moon productions and boy is that bad!to note, i almost didn't bother with a review, but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and i figured a varying opinion was in order. proceed with caution!

i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa, because in germany you can't get it anywhere. i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series, because they were full of atmosphere.i was glad when the movie finally arrived.but after watching this cheesy movie, i was very disappointed. the actors ( i think you can't even say actors) are boring and untalented. the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy.i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie. :-)

this should have rocked. vh1 moved away from the traditional divas (whitney houston, celine dion, etc.) that had made the 2003 show so stale. sadly the move backfired. the show had no mc keeping the show together. queen latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 divas. the show kicked of with a horrific rendition of lady marmalade featuring patti labelle, cyndi lauper, and jessica simpson. okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great. however, when they are competing with each other (why?) it just sounds torturous! jessica simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that i've ever witnessed! cyndi lauper also performed girl just wanna have fun. that wasn't as bad but it was hardly impressive. the worst was yet to come! cyndi and patti labelle teamed up to perform cyndi's hit 'time after time'. it was acoustic, and didn't fit in with the rest of the show. still it could've been okay if they both hadn't insisted on squealing like mamed animals. it was just dire.debbie harry (from blondie) is always cool. she has a style of her own and although maybe she can't compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can sing very well. debbie came out and performed blondie's #1 hit 'rapture'. with some lovely vocals. she really hit the notes perfectly. she looked stunning. rapper eve provided a new, but sadly inferior rap. it was good. debbie's next performance was a team-up with newcomer joss stone. they performed the blondie hit 'one way or another'. i think joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over debbie. a rather sad bit was when debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit. she should've just let joss get on with her totally inappropriate warballing. the whole of blondie performed this track. the final track debbie performed was blondie's massive hit 'call me'. it was pretty poor. not debbie's fault because you just couldn't hear her. the sound was atrocious all the way through the show.joss stone also performed a few songs on her own. they were quite well done. ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions. firstly she did diana ross' 'i'm coming out', and then chaka khan's 'ain't nobody'. she is not a diva! she can sing to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever. why not just get the real singers in. chaka was even interviewed on the show....gladys knight showed up and did a medley. it was very good. she was probably the best bit of the show. i don't know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in las vegas and her experience and class really shone through. patti labelle fitted in another performance this time her 80's hit 'new attitude'. it was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late. this was one big dud. better luck next time vh1.the version i saw was a heavily edited 55min version which was shown on vh1 in the uk. if these were the best bits.....

the first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern british film. director/adapter william cartlidge has treated wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage has been done. of the actors, prunella scales and robert hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen. the other exceptions are jonathan firth's arthur and karen hayley's mabel, who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which wilde intended. the ostensible leads, james wilby and trevyn mcdowell, are in comparison lacklustre and wooden. in an obvious attempt to eke every penny out a meagre budget, the play has been nominally updated to the 1990's, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script 1970s tv drama. true moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive are highly amusing - a sign, maybe, that more judicious pruning of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced, more even film.

potential viewers be warned, the current imdb viewer rating for "tomorrow at seven" is an anomaly of low voter turnout. it has an interesting premise, a killer leaves an ace of spades calling card at the scene of his crimes, while alerting the victim in advance. the execution falls flat however, and to say that the movie has it's share of plot holes would be to imply that there actually is a plot.chester morris portrays mystery writer neil broderick, weaving elements of actual murders by the ace of spades killer into his latest novel. broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he has to get past the man's eccentric secretary - "if you line his relatives up, you'd have enough nuts to hold a ford together". that line unceremoniously endears him to the "nut's" daughter martha (vivienne osborne), who offers to make the introductions.broderick meets thornton drake (henry stephenson) just as the latter is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a courier that morning. the only remaining pieces, as we learn in the following scene, form the bold, black shape of the ace of spades containing the words "at seven tomorrow night". now what person putting together a puzzle doesn't use the pieces with contrasting colors first! initially i was intrigued by the appearance of frank mchugh and allen jenkins in their roles as a pair of police detectives summoned to the drake residence. generally, their characters are colorful enough to offer genuine comic relief, but here they're just plain annoying. mchugh's clancy in particular winds up shouting objections to inane comments made by his partner dugan, and both usually head in the opposite direction when real trouble might turn up.now here's a question - in light of the identity of the ace killer, why would he have invited a novelist and a pair of cops that he just met, on a flight to his louisiana plantation? especially when at seven o'clock, all parties would be a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder is committed. it's not drake however who's dead, but his secretary austin winters (grant mitchell). the early suspicion falls on pilot henderson (cornelius keefe) following a lights out scene, but henderson still hasn't reported the murder to his supervisor until well after he arrives at drake's plantation with everyone else. can you imagine anyone trying to get away with that today, unless your name was ted kennedy?with the cause of death yet to be determined, the local coroner is called in, but the first one that shows up (a broderick accomplice) is a phony. yet, when the real coroner shows up, he simply disappears immediately after! in a second dark out scene, a letter from the murder victim austin winters is about to be read. it winds up missing when the lights return, and because it may point to the murderer, it becomes a clue that must be retrieved. so where was the letter? winters' daughter martha grabbed it and placed in on the mantle of the living room! how much thought was put into this?obviously, the entire affair is so inane that morris' character solves the case rather easily. even though the film comes in at just about an hour, it becomes almost a chore to watch with all the nonsense going on. there's really only one humorous moment worth repeating; while aboard the plane, the detectives have this exchange: dugan - "hey clancy, how often do these things fall?" clancy - "once!" except for mchugh and jenkins, i can't say i've seen any of the other players in films of the era, though i'm a fan of most "b" grade mystery movies from the '30's through the '50's. fortunately, the pair fares much better backing up humphrey bogart in a goofy 1938 gem - "swing your lady", where the laughs are intentional. the best i can offer about "tomorrow at seven" is a quote from martha winters about midway though this turkey - "this is just a silly waste of time".

jackie chan movies are typical examples of how offer is bigger than demand.well,to be honest,which demand?in this one jackie chan is whatever his name is in this one,i doubt if he even knows,and he is some kind of race car driver.well,he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is sped up,that way i can do all the stunts myself as well.during the great finale,in which jackie chan wants to arrest the bad guy by beating him in a race,we finally get to see how shoddy this production really is.chan's fighting,especially in the casino scene is decent,but when we're talking about special effects,dear lord.and must everyone crash in this race?that's just stupid.and here it's really not safe for the drivers,there's not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood.and don't get me started on what kind of awful story this has,i mean,it's hongkong,it was probably written at gun point by eight-year-olds,but still,what a mess.i like chan as much as the next guy,perhaps more since i saw "rush hour",but his agent's retarded cousin really needs to pick his projects better.

i just cant see what everyone sees in this movie. the acting is just awful, the choice of music is, mildly putting it, peculiar, there arent enough fighting scenes, the plot is non-existent and whatever small entertainment one could get from this film is ruined by the annoying way some of the movie is filmed and gives you a splitting headace.

"thunderbolt" is probably jackie chan's worst movie since "the protector" in 1985. yes, i know that nobody watches his movies for their stories, but the plotting of this one is unusually lame, even by his standards, and while the fight choreography is up to his standards, the fight scenes (the whole two of them) are ruined, as others have mentioned, by the frenetic, distracting camerawork. even the most serious jackie chan fans shouldn't really bother with this offensively haphazard, stunt-and-plug-filled garbage. anita yuen's cute and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues. for a good "serious jackie" movie, i recommend "crime story". (*1/2)

a bare-faced rip-off of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes. the word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this. lambert is wooden, as always (his moments of 'emotion' are laughable, as is his accent). the 'climax' is not that at all as we've had so many signals, and by the end we're simply immune to flesh, rotting and otherwise. altogether a real mess.

ok. first said, i just wanted to check whether this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. but 5,9. this is sicker than any of the killers' proceedings -,- . that made me curious what people wrote here.. which in the end made me set up an account to give my 2cents of truth into this "well of delusion" i find here.how dare you guys even mention this movie in the same sentences as e.g. seven? the only thing they got in common is that they show various crime-scenes. that-is-it. and "best thriller of 1999!" ? have you even watched another movie form that year? or any other movie in your life at all? 1999 is not a year which people are reminded of by resurrection... what's with actual movies like 8mm, eyes wide shut, arlington road, double jeopardy? (theyre actually more a "thriller" than this one could ever be..). resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to a second of 1999.really, you guys can't be serious. i watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of her. a "great film with christopher lambert"! ...which i had not yet seen? hmm.. well, first look on the covers: ok, nothing special. at second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored lambert's head, clipped his nose 'n this&that, then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it, to get the killers image on the cover. you could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy (booooh! -.- ) mouth.. whatever. turned it around and the plot starts with.. "it's raining in chicago... blabber blabber". come on, a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting. now, with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation -.- , you absolutely wanna start watching it. because it can't be that bad, it still is christopher lambert. that assumption of mine was proved wrong. with "proven wrong" i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are the "i can do 1-liners!" police chief, prudhommes wife __ actually a better detective than prudhomme when she recombines several incidents to a yet absolutely unknown hint in the case!!!! -.- __ and .. yes.. prudhomme himself) featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logic errors in a 1-minute-cycle, light-years far-fetched conclusions which in my point-of-view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera-man who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo. oh well, and if you do not completely shut down your brains (these aren't premises to watch it) then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30minutes, simply because you know any scene after the first. that is thrilling. thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. the bottom line: this is by far the worst movie i can remember. trust me, i've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. resurrection however, is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible. it was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, i laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because i was fascinated by the crew's brazenness to publish such an -extraordinary- film strip. good thing for lambert he was in highlander:endgame a year later, thus he can be pardoned. ;^oanyhow, i do recommend watching this movie to everyone. in the end, we had great fun watching it :^d. i guarantee you, after you completely watched resurrection (be brave, you can do it!) , you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap. or just go 'n watch highlander one more time... that's what i'm gonna do.

this film truly was poor. i went to the theatre expecting something exciting, and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my "guess the next plot twist before it happens" skills. seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see. nothing was truly shocking. in fact, even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much.the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony. and the scene where lambert's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience - little.probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the "x-files" treatment: every building in the film, whether it's the precinct building, or a house at noon, or a hospital, was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting (not to mention a lack of 'patients' in the case of the hospital). i don't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch. it sure would have been nice.mr. lambert really isn't an oscar-grade actor, so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth. in the end, i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching "the warriors". otherwise, you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal, and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as "silence of the lambs".

overrated, poorly written, badly acted. did the academy even watch this? i guess not. the political content guaranteed it an oscar nomination -- indo -pak border -- a little boy , terrorism. anything with the word "terrorist" gets attention inthis post 9-11 world. its like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an oscar nomination irrespective of their merits. and please cinematography does not mean shooting landscapes which are pretty in the first place. you have to be a rotten shooter to screw up making the desert pretty. at least this didn't win the oscar. they got that right at least. would have been a travesty.

this movie wasn't good. i thought it'd be a cute disney movie just like the original. wrong. it was awkward for christina ricci, whom i expect so much more than this, you could just tell by watching. i think doug e. doug did the best he could. sit 5 year olds in front of the this, any older, and they might start to fall asleep.

`it's as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head.' -pattipatti (christina ricci) is a sarcastic teenaged girl, bored with her all-too-average little town. bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady's whereabouts. now, with the help of her precious cat `d.c.' and an inept fbi agent (doug e. doug) she must find her.that darn cat is a bad movie. it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat. there are, however, a few buds of talent in it. doug e. doug was good in cool runnings. his performance as `senga' was really funny. here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent. he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat, though. micheal mckean plays patti's father. his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed, gets arrested for picking up his own cat, and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and still doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles. i wish my old man was like that. the only real good performance is christina ricci's. she entertaining as the ever-annoyed patti, but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. you might also recognize peter boyle (young frankenstein, everybody loves raymond), the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers, in this movie. this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. even the cat isn't very good... i really can't recommend 1997's that darn cat. some young children (under 8) might enjoy it a bit, but every one else should look elsewhere. if you're looking for a good christina ricci movie, i suggest addams family values, the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow. if a fun family film is what you're after, try snow day, instead.

i really enjoyed the first film and when it turned up again, without thinking, or checking, i took a family of friends to see it. i was ashamed that i had enthused so much about it to them.disney processed the original film just like the human body processes a delicious meal - takes in something good and turns out ... well, you know. and by having a dark-skinned person as the fbi man, the results of fingerprinting the informant were subdued.taken as an isolated film, i suppose it is not too bad if one likes that weird sort of thing, but when one has read the book or seen the first film - horrible!

this should not have been made into a movie. everything about it was idiotic and i don't think i laughed even once. there were bits and pieces that were okay i guess but that's about it. a lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better. there were some famous actors/actresses in this but no one did a good job, they must've just not cared. this is one of those movies that tries to have a "cute" ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. carrot top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one!final decisions:movies : nooooo!purchase dvd : absolutely not!rental : only if you've seen everything else and have a free coupon but even then it's still not worth your while.

bad movie! bad! go stand in a discount bin. carrot top should really stick to low lit comedy clubs. it's movies like this that make old jerry lewis films look like shakespeare and john agar like john barrymore. coutney thorne-smith (a fine talent)is absolutely wasted. her purpose seems mainly to look pretty and oblivious. the only enjoyable things about the movie is seeing raquel welch doing an alexis carrington type role, and estelle harris as a harridan of a landlady. the only way i can imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this (beyond sophomoric) film, is if the producers' fourth grade child was allowed to pick the script. well, maybe his third grader. what this film really needs is to be rubbed in the noses of its creators.

first and foremost this movie has the stupidest plot of any movie i have ever seen, and unfortunately i had to see this one. i was flipping through channels one day and stumbled upon this lousy excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what i have been saying for a long time. carrot top is not an actor, and is not funny in the slightest sense. he acts like he's a great comedian and thinks he commands the audiences attention. frankly he has the acting ability of a 10 year old class clown, scratch that less than a 10 year old's ability to compare them to carrot top would be a grave insult upon their good name. this movie tries to be funny using dull one liners which all seem to have been lifted from 50's cartoons. by the end i would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie, but sadly the memories stay with me. the only thing i can do is to warn others to never to watch this movie. however it proves the rumors true carrot top can't act worth a damn.

yes, the votes are in. this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation. but whereas ed wood's film, for all its flaws, retains a certain charm despite it all, this film defines the word "charmless" to the nth degree. in fact, i'd suggest to the editors of the oxford english dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionary.carrot top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill mr. top as soon as possible. indeed, if one goes to amazon.com and look at customer reviews for carrot top's movie and other performance dvd, one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr. top.one other curious fact about this film, i recall that mike nelson, the head writer for mst 3000, in his book mike's mega cheese about movies, good and bad, said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldn't recall a thing about it, including the title. obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma. viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing, mike nelson had to block it from his mind. (evidently, in a later chapter in his book, mike nelson had recovered his memeory of this film. from the review he offers, mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory.)the only comment i offer about the film, and it is not a spoiler, it's simply god's honest truth, it's not funny. none of it is, not even a nanosecond of it is funny.

this is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history. the invention gags by carrot top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history. i am not familiar with his other work, but if it is half as bad as this then i am just going to cry. i give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars, and may god have mercy on the souls of those responsible.

masterpiece. carrot top blows the screen away. never has one movie captured the essence of the human spirit quite like "chairman of the board." 10/10... don't miss this instant classic.

"chairman of the board" is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic carrot top (also seen on the 1-800-collect commercials). he plays a surfing inventor who comes upon a man who has a flat tire. top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guy's died and has given his company to the comedian. even if someone else was in carrot top's role, it still would have been bad. the jokes (which are constantly rigged throughout) are terrible and the idea of a romantic "plot twist" should have been discarded. do not watch!!!

the humor is non-existent in this loser of a movie. carrot top plays a surfer dude inventor who consistently blows the rent money on his goofy, useless inventions. then he helps an old guy broken down by the side of the road, and voila, he's inherited a major corporation. and on and on and on past the jealous relatives, humanizing the corporation, hostile takeovers, the obligatory love interest.. aargh...let's just say this movie is virtually unwatchable. what carrot top has accomplished is to convince me never to go to his stage shows.

so i turned on hbo which i just got thinking that it would have some quality movies and i saw this. carrot top is so unfunny it's nauseating to watch. i've seen unfunny movies before but i think i find this one so impossible to watch because carrot top seems to think he's hilarious. watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy, over the top overreactions replete with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate.what is amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed on for this project, such as larry miller and m emmet walsh. if you've ever seen carrot top's absolutely horrible mci commercials (or whatever they were) then this is more of the same, just worse. it's a slapstick fest that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something, saved homeless people... anything but this. i'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time but for the $10 million spent it's a disgrace.

this movie is stupid. there's no getting around it. but so is dumb and dumber. mind you, dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this. however, i for one love seeing stupid movies (tail sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. call me callous, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.

there are many mysteries in life. for example: why did any of the people other than carrot top agree to appear in this movie? why did anyone distribute this movie? why did anyone pay money to see it? i guess none of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing i know for sure, this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big. it would already be bad, but the addition of carrot top's "humor" makes it even worse. the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it, smash it, or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion. if you were to rank it against every movie ever made, it would be right between "problem child" and "biodome". nuff said.

i've got as much testosterone as the next bloke, and raquel welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better, and an hour and half of ms. w showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make.considering the cast, it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. i've never been a big fan of wagner, and his tough guy harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. godfrey cambridge and vittorio de sica, both of whom i usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for edward g...well, i can only assume he was there for the paycheck.this film is a mess: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. if it weren't for miss welch, i'd have given it a 0.that said, she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'bedazzled' - and for that reason alone i gave it a 3.

following his role in the fine caper seven thieves (1960) – which i’ve watched several years back – edward g. robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in the cincinnati kid [1965]). i’d previously watched the pretty good “euro-cult” effort grand slam (1967) and, apart from this, i’ve yet two more similar titles from italy to check – one of which was directed by future goremeister lucio fulci! anyway, this is the kind of international production – featuring american and italian actors and a british director – which was prevalent during the 1960s; it’s harmless and easy-going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong – especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.the gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an american (robert wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (raquel welch) – the others are a ‘pacifist’ black man, a perennially hungry italian and a diminutive englishman. they try to induce an ex-gangster (vittorio de sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except he’s destitute…but, under the auspices of “professor” robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars’ worth of platinum! needless to say, the gang members don’t trust one another (wagner instructs welch to seduce de sica so as to get the name of their fence in morocco – where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the italian can’t resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). amusingly, in the face of similar failures, de sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days – however, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! the central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including welch, ‘take’ the train transporting the platinum, wagner kidnaps pilot victor spinetti and his airplane. when the job is done, he fully intends to double-cross de sica – but neither his partners nor welch herself are willing to go along with this, so he’s forced to relent. coming from the time when crime didn’t pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane’s bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened…

this movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés. the writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic. it a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of bugs bunny cartoons) and silly supporting characters (the lady doctor and the writer). there are much better bogart films out there. in fact, bogart looks like he slept through this performance. he puts very little effort into this character. i think the directorial advice he received was something like "he's a bad guy. act bad". this guy is the era's equivalent of darth vader; obvious, evil and the anti-hero. don't waste your time with this one.

although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld, i'm willing to bet he didn't thank jack warner for it. in fact this film was one hollow crown.king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film, dr. socrates, but given humphrey bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like duke mantee in the petrified forest. he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephenson.kay francis and john eldredge are a pair of married doctors and eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogart's henchmen. bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives eldredge $500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income. but when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence. it's no good and she and her aunt jessie busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again. but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least.bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. he's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. he's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. and then let's kay francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything.definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars.

this was the worst wrestlemania in history. the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs. hercules hernandez, and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team (this one bordered on classic). everything else was either poor or awful. the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary, confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show. the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary, especially susan saint james.if you're interested in the mid 80's wwf, you're better renting or buying wrestlemania 3, or just about any other ppv for that matter.

*possible spoilers ahead*i'll only say what hasn't already been said here (and i'll continue this for the rest of my wwf/wwe comments).if you're going to have a women's title match, at least make it interesting, rather than just a squash to put over the current champion. i guess moolah couldn't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a wrestlemania.i thought the killer bees were wasted in wrestlemanias, especially here. i became a fan in 1989, about a year after the b. brian blair was gone and jim brunzell became a canvas back. so i didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team, even top contenders.but i loved seeing bill fralic in the battle royal. he really came into his own here, creating a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal. besides steve mcmichael and kevin greene, he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling (anyone remember dennis rodman?). and what was with the hart foundation's ridiculous green tights?

wrestlemania 2 is the only wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations, and while it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. there are only really two matches that really struck out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. there are some entertaining celebrity's on hand, like susan saint james, ray charles and cathy crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. the british bulldgos vs the dream team match, is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see that anywhere.matches.nassau coliseum.paul orndorff vs the magnificent muraco/w mr.fuji. for the time it had, and despite the crappy finish, this was surprisingly bearable stuff, with the crowd being really into it. crowd chants "bullsh*t" at the end. that being said it did nothing for either's career. match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring2/5intercontinental championship match. randy savage|c| vs george "the animal" steele. not that great wrestling wise, but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved, and some great comedy from steele, besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for leverage.2 1/2 /5jake "the snake" roberts vs george wells. for a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to make any impact what so ever. roberts wins with the ddt, pulling out the snake afterwords, which disgusts saint james.1 1/2 /5boxing match. mr.t/w the hati kid&joe frazier vs roddy piper/w lou duva&bob orton. a huge failure in my opinion. i was bored senseless throughout this, and while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me. lot of rowdy chants are noticeable as well. t wins by dq, when piper slams t.1/5rosemont horizonwomen's title match. fabulous moolah|c| vs velvet mcintyre. ends too quickly, before it even gets a chance to start, making a record for quick pin fall, as far as woman's matches are concerned. moolah wins when she takes advantage of velvet's missed splash from the top rope0/5corporal kirchner vs nikolai volkoff/w classy freddie blassie. big pop for the corporal. stupid match up, with boring offense from both involved, while being much too short to matter. corporal wins when he whacks volkoff with blassie's cane.1/5battle royal. william perry and andre get the biggest pops. this is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the nfl talent involved. it's also noteworthy for bret hart's 1st ever wrestlemania appearance. andre wins when he chucks the hart foundation out.2 1/2 /5tag team titles. british bulldogs/w lou albano&ozzy osbourne vs the dream team/w johnny valiant|c|. absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. you won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. this is pure wrestling at it's finest, you cannot call yourself a wrestling fan, if you dislike this match. bulldogs win when dynamite kid collide's heads with valentine4/5los angeles memorial sports arenaricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez. pretty decent match up here, with both men putting on solid performances. hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, and it contrasted well with steamboat's high-flying style. steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.2 1/2 /5adrian adonis vs uncle elmer. terrible match, with annoying comedy involved. the fans love uncle elmer, but i do not. adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.0/5the funk brothers vs tito santana&jyd. pretty solid match here, with a lot of memorable bumps taken from terry funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. i would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. funks win with help from jimmy hart's megaphone.3/5wwf championship. hulk hogan|c| vs king kong bundy. decent pop for hogan. one of the most over-hyped matches in wrestlemania history. hogan can't wrestle worth a lick, and bundy is not that great himself. the violence was brutal for the time, but hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. hogan wins when he escapes before bundy.1/5bottom line. wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but you really don't have too. there isn't enough here, to satisfy a true wrestling fan. vince blew it on this one. don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst wrestlemania's, outside of the brilliant tag title match.4/10

why do the powers that be continue to cast jennifer lopez in unbelievable roles? she was excellent in selena, and pretty good in money train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. however, roles like this just draw the line. i could never see lopez as an fbi agent (see out of sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? give me a break!basically, lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. when she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.lopez's acting here is typically below average. i can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. she's no julia roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. well, she's not even in the same stadium. sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it certainly doesn't carry this one. with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.having said all that, this film is visually stunning. the colors are fabulous, and the story line isn't half bad in a b-movie kind of way. the audio here is superb as well. this movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline, and major points for how it looks and sounds. unfortunately, the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches.my rating: 6/10

i love exotic science fiction/fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch. suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (live or dead), other gruesome scenes, plot holes, boring acting made this a regretable experience, the basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or tv (an outer limits episode was better at exploring this idea). i gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.

if you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, skip it. at the end of the movie i still didn't know why stargher killed the women the way he did. when you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. in dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. they also hinted at a dark background for vaughn's character but didn't explain, didn't really say why lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem, etc. if the rest of the story is compelling, i don't care about details like how stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the fbi wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work, but i do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.

as i said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential. i was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical american mass movie: "we are in this for the money..." if only the producers had had more time to actually make the movie. this one was not finished when they let it out...

i really enjoy this genre but the cell was one of the worst movies i've ever been unfortunate enough to watch. while about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) i was dumb enough to stick it out. the main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. not only did i lose track of the girl, i was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when i did remember she was part of the story i really didn't care what happened to her. while the visuals were interesting in an lsd flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see phantom menace for another example) finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? ridiculous.

i'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst, stupidest, retarded and waste time, movies that i have ever seen and i saw napolean dinamite. they are both equally terrible. conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and pat conroy overcomes nothing! i'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film. the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie i don't know why this movie was even made, deviantly top five worst movies of all time.

not the best of the lone star series, but it moves along quickly with good performances. introduced as "singin' sandy" in the main title, john wayne as a 'singing cowboy' isn't successful-- you never even see a front close-up of him while he's 'singing.' the actual singer is the director's son, bill bradley, who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as hutch or joseph wagstaff. the film features: cecilia parker (also seen in "the lost jungle" serial, "tombstone canyon," and as older sister marian in the andy hardy movies) doing her best katherine hepburn-- "really they mustn't; really i'm not"; al st. john, before he literally became "fuzzy" filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping, head and chin scratching, grimacing, and gawky physical gestures and movements; george (pre-gabby) hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father; and forrest taylor, minor vet of 395 movies and tv shows, playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar. fun or odd moments: yakima canutt's great 'under the stagecoach' trick; the 'gay' scene when singin' sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face, drags them roped to his horse, and dumps them at kincaid's office, where kincaid says, "you're a fine pair of lovebirds!"; denton's rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by 'sandy,' -- "ummm. i could listen to that all night!"; kincaid's reply, we won't go into that," after being told by a rancher "you've got the soul of a snake!"; and, of course, he utters the immortal, "i've made denton an offer he can't refuse." the plot of the movie is saved by sandy's tricking kincaid, and later saying the three magic words in many of these films: "i'm from washington." fdr has saved us from the depression! (is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate?) the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier bradbury film "man from hell's edges" (1932). all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters, the troupe of actors and stunt people, and the spin on the clichés and repetitive back stories and situations. this one ranks a little low, marred by the inappropriate and mis-used "singing cowboy" gimmick. i'll give it a 4.

"riders of destiny" was the first of several westerns wayne made for the lone star arm of monogram pictures between 1933 and 1935. in this entry, the producers try to make the duke into a singing cowboy called "singin' sandy saunders with hilarious results. any wayne fan knows that the duke couldn't have carried a tune if his life had depended on it. his voice was apparently dubbed by smith ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like wayne. wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in "performing" the musical numbers. thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended.as for the movie itself, it contains a standard "b" western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (forrest taylor) and the local ranchers. duke, of course plays the hero. he had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy.also cast in the film were george (pre-gabby) hayes as the heroine's father, cecilia parker as the heroine and yakima canutt as "one of the boys" who performs his "falling from the racing horses under the wagon" stunt while doubling wayne. both canutt and hayes would go on to appear with wayne in most of the other entries in the series. canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on wayne's future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse.as "b" westerns go this one isn't too bad, however, i have to give it a failing grade because of the "singing".

this is one of the worst films i've ever seen, don't watch it even if your life depends on it.this laurel and hardy film is when they inherit an island, become shipwrecked and are set to be hung. an incredibly boring film that is no where near funny.this was the last laurel and hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. the 40's films weren't great, this film was made in 1950. if you want to remember laurel and hardy, remember them in their prime, the 1930's. the short talking films are better than the feature length films, my favourite is "me and my pal". another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed. the actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later. absoulutley crap, but let's end on a high note, laurel and hardy have been, in my opinion, the best double act ever.

i could almost wish this movie had not been made. stan laurel was dying, and it shows in his face, even more angular and gaunt than usual. a poor script, and inept supporting cast.

i never want to see this movie again!not only is it dreadfully bad, but i can't stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick.mostly i can't stand watching this terrible movie!frankly, there is no reason to watch this awful film. the plot is just plain stupid. the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films! i warn you don't watch it, the images will haunt you for a long while to come!

first, let me start by saying that i am a laurel and hardy buff. i have read every book printed about them, and have seen all of their available films more than once. i even took a chance once, and called stan on the telephone. he was very kind, and spoke with me for over ten minutes. i followed with a letter, and he wrote me a letter back. i still have that letter.this film has some fine comedy moments, but stan and ollie are not up to their usual form. stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later. in my opinion, any laurel and hardy film is worth seeing.but the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great stan laurel himself. to quote him, "this film should never have been made."

"atoll k" aka "utopia" is one of hollywood's saddest swan songs. filmed in france, "the land that loves lewis (jerry)" in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff, the boys are in truly terrible shape physically. however, they aren't in nearly as bad a shape as the script.this movie is one of the un-funniest "comedies" ever filmed.it's painful to see this legendary team, the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures, the twosome that made "the devil's brother" (1933), "the music box," (1932),"pack up your troubles" (also 1932), "babes in toyland" (1934), "bonnie scotland" (1935), "flying deuces" (1939) and so many more gut-wrenching, laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies, in a film such as this.but fighters and ballplayers do it all the time. they stay in the game one season or one fight too many. in this case, while is morbidly fascinating to see laurel & hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers, they, too, stuck around for one too many.

when the movie begins, it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are. although oliver hardy is enormous, it is stanley that looks like death warmed over. apparently, he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight. although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. additionally, as i watched the film i was shocked how many pratfalls stan took--i half expected his to drop dead from the exertion. i really can't understand why they came out of retirement considering their health--especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film. stanley inherits an island and a boat. he and ollie are ready to leave when antoine, a stateless man, is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island. along the way, they discover that giovanni has stowed away, but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. it seems like paradise and they are all very happy. a bit later, a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand.unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff. eventually, the mob decides to hang the four men and take over--at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared.i will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. however, one thing it is not is funny--and that is unforgivable for a laurel and hardy flick. while not a bad film, it certainly isn't a good one. a sad end to their brilliant careers.all the actors, except for the duo, are dubbed into english, as the movie was made in france. while it may not be the very worst film they made (this would be the big noise), it sure is close!! watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident.

as if the world hadn't already got enough cheap jaws imitations, writer boaz davidson decided to make the sequel to his ropey-but-reasonably-enjoyable creature-feature octopus a complete rip-off of spielberg's classic, right down to having a concerned cop who no-one believes, and a mayor more worried about his 4th july celebrations than people's lives.even in the hands of an extremely skilled director, it is unlikely that this derivative rubbish could have been anything other than hokey b-movie garbage, but with yossi wein (yes the yossi wein!) calling the shots behind the camera, a man with a fraction of mr.spielberg's talent (i estimate about 1/10000th), octopus 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one might imagine!the predictable and extremely clichéd plot isn't worth describing in much detail (substitute jaws' amity island with new york, and bruce the shark with a giant rubber octopus and you'll get the gist), although several points about the film are definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all of the octopus attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredibly fake-looking giant tentacles look real, which is hilarious to behold; bulgaria's capital, sofia, unconvincingly stands in for new york, and overuse of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing; best of all, a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero atop the statue of liberty, is not only gut-bustingly stupid but also features some truly dreadful special effects.davidson's script also doesn't know when to quit: there are several points in this film at which it could've (and probably should've) ended, but the action goes on and on, with the octopus surviving several explosions, and causing a tunnel to collapse (trapping the film's love interest and a bunch of kids), before finally being blown to smithereens by the hero.sometimes very silly, always awful technically, but never actually scary, this stv stinker may find fans amongst those who actively seek out cinematic trash. most normal people, however, would be advised to steer well clear.

oh wow, the character shares my name first name! nick! this movie as bad as the first one, if not worse. well, at least there's an actual octopus in this movie. an actual octopus that makes a better appearance in this film. by better, i mean, "longer" the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through. just to let you know, when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back. not only that, but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide, realising how horrible life is after watching this film. really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately? this film should have been the final straw, so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema, that could make some actually good modern horror films, this movie bites.

just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the michigan bar exam. i wanted something that was mindless and that i could just sit back and say, "what the hell were they thinking?" i was not disappointed in this undertaking, but had i been watching this one in a serious mood, i would have been irate. the company that made this thing just spliced cgi footage from the first octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "bride of the monster" look like a masterpiece of special effect footage. since when does an octopus have fangs? the plot is that an nypd diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the hudson river shortly before the fourth of july. he and his partner (who is soon to be transferred, or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the mayor's office. of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office. surprisingly, all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.really lame. don't bother with it.

a flesh-eating octopus, where does that guy boaz(what the..?) davidson keep getting inspiration? anyway,even for the low,low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people-genre and me,this one is just beyond awful.the octopus is one of the lamest,laziest,weakest monsters i've ever seen.i think he just ended up in the (ahum)east river because sea world got sick of him.the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them.bunch of idiots,that way he'll never learn!you guys want all the other giant killer octopuses(that's the correct plural,by the way)to laugh at him?meanies.up to stop the octopus are wind,razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick hartfield and his partner,who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus.hooray,octopus won the fight!a couple more and he's going to evolve(the scars in my mind stay).nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing(doesn't he have a gun or something?)but no,that magically doesn't help either.okay,enter sea cop's love interest rachel starbird.is this based on some comic book or something?anyway,together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park.they hope this helps,cos it's the 4th of july in a couple of days,and the octopus might join the party.and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk.rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops.but all's crappy that ends crappy,nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times,and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh.you know,on tummy-vision,this would probably get an r.in real life,i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is:suitable for absolutely nobody.there's no sex,no gore,no nothing.now forget this movie ever existed.join the club.

i wish i could find some good things to say about this animated sequel(but not really a sequel)to "atlantis:the lost empire"but this would be a very short comment.the magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found here.the animation is pretty poor all over,the characters themselves are not very well drawn.the backgrounds and the foregrounds are also not good.there's very little attention to detail here.and instead of a compelling and engaging story,we have 3 short stories which are boring and don't make a lot of sense.i swear,even the characters sounded like they were bored,and would rather be somewhere else.which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be someplace else,at least that's the impression.some of the same actors return for this dismal effort,but an integral par of the success of the first one was michael j.fox as the main hero, milo thatch.i get the distinct impression this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the success of the first one,without much thought or care.but at least cree summer returns as the voice of "kida".that's probably the only good thing about this movie,and even she doesn't seem to have her heart completely in it.mind you,i guess you couldn't blame any of the cast for not giving their all,considering what they had to work with.or rather not work with.this is a straight to video movie(and i use the term loosely)which should have went straight to the nearest landfill.anyway,shame on disney.consumers deserve much better than this.this one gets a 0/10 and a well deserved one at that.p.u

what the (beep) is going wrong with disney the last years? are there totally run out of good ideas? where is the magic? where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good... okay, i know, walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney? i never rent or bought a disney-sequel of what movie however. because i had read much enough about its (absence of) quality. but "atlantis: milo's return" was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it. it confirmed my doubts about sequels. it was absolutely boring. flaw animation, primitive color-rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous multiplane-camera with cgi, mediocre music and a patchwork of different, simple stories. it looks absolutely not like disney! not like disney i know! it looks like one of the countless, cheap and simple animation-series like "dragonballz", "beyblade" etc. that aired every day on tv for children.my first reaction after showing this crap, was to load "bambi" in my dvd-player, to see disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again, to see disney on its climax again, to see the awesome art of handmade animation again. "bambi" was the first (and until today the only) movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars. but "atlantis: milo's return"? no magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit... it deserved only 3 out of 10!

when i put this movie in my dvd player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, i had some expectations. i was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong-points of the first movie: awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. but, to my disappointment, not any of this is to be found in atlantis: milo's return. had i read some reviews first, i might not have been so let down. the following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.when the first scene appears, your in for a shock if you just picked atlantis: milo's return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations i had. the music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (with the exception of a few characters, like the voice of sweet). the actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. the storyline is also pretty weak, as its more like three episodes of schooby-doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. but dont misunderstand, it's not very good schooby-doo episodes. i didnt laugh a single time, although i might have sniggered once or twice.to the audience who haven't seen the first movie, or don't especially care for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: if you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. if you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. and i suspect it might be a good kids movie, but i wouldn't know. it might have been better if milo's return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast tv.

because disney more often than not, ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their sequels, this was actually a nice surprise. i don't know why disney does not pay more attention to their sequels. the graphics quality is always inferior; no backgrounds worthy of the name disney, inane plots, and worse dialog, with little or no attention given to the actual story, and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality.the animation quality is still poor when compared to disney originals, and the dialog is quite trite, the story line and overall execution was really quite enjoyable. while it is not as captivating, it does not completely fail to capture the charm and/or mystery from the first. there is some hint of it, tucked away here and there.the children will like it, at any rate.it rates a 4.5/10 from...the fiend :.

i will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. the only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "atlantis: the lost empire" are back. several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and james arnold taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only michael j. fox as milo james thatch. the reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voice-over work for obi-wan kenobi in "clone wars" want to copy michael j. fox? i happen to have an answer to this. because they are the same person who thought he had to copy eddie murphy from mulan in mulan ii. yes, sadly, it is true..

if you've seen atlantis 1, then you'd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script. this movie was so sloppily drawn and animated. the story is also dopey. i was so disappointed in this half-baked drivel that i couldn't make it past the first hour, and man did i try! the one thing this film had was that it expanded the "mole" character, making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional. take it from me, judge this junk from the cover on the video box. the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock, clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent. if this was a stand alone flick, it wouldn't be so bad, but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable.

this should have been a short film, nothing more. the length of 1,5 hours is much too long, because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke. it's getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie.to do yourself a favor, don't mention to see that movie...

yep, this has got to be one of the lamest movies i've ever seen. it's utterly tasteless, has no style whatsoever, the story is so thin that you can watch television through it, and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it.sure, i appreciate a good b-movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do. but this has got to be the worst i've seen. in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b-movie interesting.the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other, various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on-screen.it's not even funny. in fact it's quite the opposite. i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability.i find nothing good to say about this movie. it was a waste of time watching it, and i hope others don't do the same mistake. if you also pay for it you should get a serious brainscan done.

the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called "mccinsey's island". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump "guest house paradiso" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show "bottom", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like "trainspotting", "28 days later", "four weddings and a funeral" and the brilliant "shaun of the dead" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. "guest house paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "i'm watching this so they don't have to" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.trust me, i used to love the "bottom" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's "drop dead fred" seem like "the godfather" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.

wow, this film was terrible. it is as simple as that. it is actually the first time that i walked out early, as far as i can remember. this turned out okay, though: i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a "movie".where to start. bad acting, bad jokes. faecal humour, which i simply cannot stand. sorry, but snot, pee and scat are *not* funny. you have seen the title picture? that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. it is not.apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, i do not remember much about this. at least not much good. i was really, really disappointed by this piece of garbage. or let us be honest here: given that i am actually a big fan of "british" (i.e., black) humour, i was angry.so, want my advice? three words: do not watch.

i have always been a fan of bottom, grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states. the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius, and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail. i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness... and was utterly disappointed by the end.the first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, ade!), but with some utterly brilliant moments. unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is. the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.the end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those of you who've seen it) was... perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade. honestly. it was one joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which did).to sum up, i was sorely disappointed by this movie. i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the fondest memories that i can... but i have to warn you, if you're about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer, don't. there are far better things to spend your money on.

the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great! however, ade edmonson & rik mayall have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter. ten years ago, rik mayall's mad stare and ade's idiocy were funny, now they are just annoying.the film had promise - though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea - but failed to deliver. the saving graces were competent performances from simon (spaced, big train) pegg and helene mathieu, and the film is only 90 minutes long. sorry, guys, but you really have hit the bottom

being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film.i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride......alas.where to start on this mess?i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny.i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut.the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the 'terrible' guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run,but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created.the acting,at times,is pathetic.fenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and i've seen simon pegg have much better outings.i'd recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned

i had seen rik mayall in blackadder and the new statesman, so i thought i'd give this film a try.at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't. at around 8.45pm i threw the dvd into the dustbin. and that's where this "film" belongs.what ever happened to british humour? the humour so fine and witty, intelligent and artful that you find in yes, minister, blackadder, vicar of dibley, fawlty towers or the fast show? the black humour britain is so famous for? i don't want to insult anybody, but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny. they deserve more intelligent fun. and rik mayall, you can do better, so please, do!

possibly the worst film within the genre in existence. it was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to. it is toilet humour at its very poorest, i would avoid even watching the trailer. i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python, you are bound to love this. whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged. i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement. rarely do i leave the cinema, really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me: this one did it in just 30 minutes.

the first time i had heard of guest house paridiso was in the, er... "washroom" after having just seen fight club. in each urinal was deposited a small, round black circle. when the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it caused a colour picture to form, with photographs of the two stars and the tag line "you'll p*** yourself laughing". when you'd finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again, waiting to spring it's surprise on the next "victim".okay, maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. in fact, i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, that's a real feat. what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise.i hate to pan guest house paridiso and i am indebted to rik mayall (richard twat) and adrian edmondson (eddie elizabeth ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, be it the invention of the young ones (1982-1984), the sitting room plays of bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, such as rik in the new statesman (1988-1993). in fact, this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special. unfortunately, its an 89 minute film.there's definitely some merit to be had, and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale, which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark, and involved... well, you'll have to see that bit for yourself. yet often the pace is leaden, and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. the two stars (edmondson taking his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he adequately directs) never really get into first gear, mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. indeed, the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. the slight hints of depth seen in the series (richie's effeminate, failed social-climbing for example) are not present here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.the fawlty towers accusation does pass water, complete with drunken chef and unseen, called-for waiter "pasquele", which uncannily rhymes with manuel. some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there, and all the "dead laugh" areas patched up with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago.paridiso's brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humour is funny, and i feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.

no wonder so many young people have attention deficit disorder. it seems that stage (dance) productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director/ editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show. is there a special emmy category for this feat? try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this, otherwise, completely unwatchable show. i tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production. that was impossible. they didn't appear to have any faces, just blurs - it was just michael flatley's face, michael flatley's bare chest(nice sheen!), michael flatley's feet, and that patented flatley over-the-shoulder-come-hither look repeated infinity squared. since he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job i guess that was to be expected. one doesn't have to wonder too much as to who his target audience is. riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience, not the catwalk,side wings, or floor nail perspective. if i'm not mistaken,i believe sir michael has retired. thank god for small blessings.

the production values in this video are so poor that it is unwatchable. the performance took second place to the overwhelmingly creative hijinks of the studio wanks, with about thirty special effects per minute. it is filmed through a cloud of smoke, only one or two seconds duration per shot and frequently, background spotlights shine directly into the camera. the lighting was terrible for filming. there is constant zooming in and out with a total lack of visual continuity. there may have been some good dancing available to the live audience but the video viewers will never know.

i saw the film many times, and every time i am more and more disappointed,which is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good. the shame here is, that holiwood tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea. my self coming from the balkans(macedonia) found this film disappointing.simply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed. to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu, you need to know their background, way of live, what makes them cry and laugh.and the director of the film didn't took that as guideline. when we(ex yu) make films, lots of symbolism is build in it, which makes the characters recognisable and likable, and mostly portraying the truth(if it is based on true story) the films like "pritty village, pretty flame", "tito and me', "underground',"no mans land', "before the rain","black cat, white cat","otac na sluzbenom putu",(when father was away on business),"ko to tamo peva"(who sings over there?)rare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematography,and nothing can compare to it. not the half baked story of and holiwood studio. as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection. i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too, and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too. and to add insult to the injury, half of the things are shoot in bitola ,macedonia where i come from. imagen my shock when i saw the broad st. of bitola in the opening scene of the film, when the bride is shoot from the sniper.and what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film? anyway very disappointing, as the truth is far away from the film. shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire, before they shoot the film. book is one thing and real life is other, and this film lets down both.

how living the dream managed to get into the laemmle 5 in west hollywood is beyond me, as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i should have known when the first scene opened in-gasp, eugene, oregon-,that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school,but can't, as they are such losers, is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad.then, cliché, the three high school losers end up in la, and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting. but no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines. even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent. and, they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience, just showing "the supposed good life" in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad, they better not have sag cards...i could go on and on about this bad film, but i ended up walking out of the theater, which had at the start six people, and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience. i wanted to like this film, but i couldn't find one merit in the story, characters, writing, dialog, nor the actors. whoever cast this film should retire. amen...enough...

this movie is a real low budget production, yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered. i give this movie a low rating for the story alone, but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie. he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like. my main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, i was never convinced that they were close. i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film.he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close. he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money. i agree that they did not do much for the film.another fact about the movie, that i was not aware of, is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience. this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer. the story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audience's reaction to his own tragedy. and the story is tragic. however, it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters, least of all the lead. what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means, regardless who gets hurt. when ms. young's character decides to give up he evil ways, it appears that she does so because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it.

jeez, this was immensely boring. the leading man (christian schoyen) has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here. or to say it in my own language "skikkelig gebrokkent". but it is cool to see norwegian dudes in a movie made in hollywood. it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks. the storyline itself is below mediocre. i have a suspicion that christian schoyen did this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another.

there have been many movies, on living the american dream. and this is one of them.first of all, on the technical side, there is a lot wrong. the audio is bad, i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could have been better.they really tried to come up with a good movie, but for example the part where they show, how jonathan is loosing himself in the dream,with girls, drugs and alcohol, is done very badly. the acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie.i had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end, and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.if your expectations are low, and you're bored on a sunday with bad weather, watch it. if you in for a deep story with action, then this is not your movie.normally i would not have give a score of 1, but of 4.5 for this movie. but the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio, and camera uses, not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects.

a klutzy young man returns west after being schooled in the hotel business via boston; he quickly learns his friends in spanish-colonized old california expect him to fill his deceased father's shoes instead--that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them. colorful but silly m-g-m production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera, but it never takes off. this might have been fun, second-string material for abbott & costello, but frank sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead. combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes are hindered by the poor staging (sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror, but one doesn't concentrate on his performance so much as noticing how odd the star appears reflected in this way!). kathryn grayson is the governor's daughter who falls for frank, and her high soprano trilling turns her singing scenes into self-parody. aside from robert surtees' cinematography and the decent art direction, this "bandit" remains kissless. * from ****

this must be one of mgm's and frank sinatras worst films. an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect. silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing bandit. he's no bandit and doesn't kiss!! he does play the "nerdy" character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak. the scene stealer's are j. carroll nash and mildred natwick. too bad they didn't have more scenes together. i've given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by kathtren grayson "love is where you find it", is sensational. could have had a repirse of that one. also, a comic type dance number by ridcardo mantalban, cyd charisse and ann miller if fun. so for those reasons and those reasons only, it is watchable. kissing bandit is part of the frank sinatra early years collection.

perhaps the director was trying for another pirate (good garland and kelly musical) -- but this lame musical epoch falls flat. sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well -- and their chemistry together lacks spark. the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late "bandito" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role. what's amazing and wonderful here, is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. when grayson sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting. she has her big moment with "love is where you find it" which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities. the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets. co-stars mildred natwick and j. carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work. aside from sinatra's singing there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with ricardo montalban, cyd charisse and ann miller. it's fascinating and weird. montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity.

the kissing bandit was the third and final film that frank sinatra and kathryn grayson co-starred at mgm with. the first two were anchors aweigh and it happened in brooklyn. and in both sinatra wooed and lost grayson. i guess the third time's the charm.for romance maybe, but definitely not for screen image. sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants. poaching on tyrone power's territory laid out in the mark of zorro, sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and the kissing bandit by night. he's gone and left california for an education and has come back ready to take dad's place, but in the hotel business only. and where does he learn the hotel business, boston.of course some of dad's former gang members, grown a little old and paunchy led by j. carrol naish, want him to lead the gang again. but frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life. but he does make a good impression on the governor's daughter, kathryn grayson.somebody must have had it in for sinatra at mgm to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in miracle of the bells. frank's in a part that was more suitable for red skelton. but since this was a musical, i guess the brain trust at mgm figured kathryn grayson had to have a singing co-star.in fact the best number in the film are for her, love is where you find it. also ricardo montalban, ann miller, and cyd charisse do a dance specialty that is nice. frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular.in later years, sinatra would wince at the mention of the kissing bandit and with good reason.

german emigree and uber-hambone actor paul muni who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up goes "blackface" to play a humble mexican immigrant living in los angeles and working his way up in the world. if this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of al pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultured cuban in the remake of scarface, don't be too surprised. the characters are quite similar, and both get wildly pop-eyed when the script calls for it. hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by muni's over-the-top performance as this giddy mexican living the american dream, consequences be damned. i guess benicio deltoro's grandfather wasn't available. a young, bleached-blonde bette davis plays one of muni's love interests; she eventually goes insane for love of mr. meh-hee-can muni. an absolute hoot, davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap. there is an absolutely delirious near the end when muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him -- a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted, stage-like '30s accents that hollywood loved so much -- and she calls him a savage and a brute, of "a different tribe." muni immediately transforms into mr. hyde and chases her to an untimely death. in the final scene, a repentant muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is going back to his own people, his own kind. end of movie. finis. that's all she wrote. muni was said to have hired a gen-oo-ine mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits. yowza!

paul muni and bette davis overact monstrously while lacklustre studio hack archie mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives its "bittersweet ending" by condoning segregationist attitudes. heavy handed and poorly constructed the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never recovers from as mr. muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent fashion.johnny ramirez is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and grit attains a law degree from a store front night school. in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only ineptitude and is quickly made to look the fool by his well heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends he be disbarred. devastated by the setback an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by the owner charlie roark (eugene palette) who likes his style. the owner cuts him in on the place but problems arise with mrs. roark (davis) who also wants a piece of johnny. she kills charlie, implicates johnny and slowly goes mad before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from "different tribes, savage" and it will never work. when she flees to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car. ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that its best to stay with your own.in addition to this appalling denouement bordertown has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story. unfair as his plight might be, muni's ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed blunderer. davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni. her lady macbeth mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era. margaret lindsay as muni's american dream is cold, remote and flat.bad as bordertown is (and it is very) it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes. the rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction.

i fail to see how anyone who has actually read the m. didius falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them. an aussie has no business in ancient rome. nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script. kevin connor and lee zlotoff have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits.

i am a fan of good historical fiction, and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it. writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but when you have a book you are adapting, it would be nice to actually follow the plot line.the portrayals of the vespasians (the actual emperor, and his 2 sons titus and domitian) was horrid. they acted like a cookie cutter caligula, and were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation. there was a scene with titus dispensing justice as if he was caligula (from the movie of the same name.) the way the vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period - they were fair, and sane, not tainted by the imperial claudian insanity.helena (the love interest of marcus didius falco) gives as her reason for divorcing pertinax (one of the traitors referenced in the title) was that he was a traitor, yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person.marcus in the movie gets a slave named justus, yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment, let alone afford a slave. there was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave justus and a female gladiator...on the whole, if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get caligula, if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint, get i, claudius.

i hate to comment on something i didn't finish, but if i spare one person what i sat through for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust, it will be worth it. i decided to watch this with an open mind, knowing it was on the bottom 100.bad idea. i usually love crude humor, or can at least tolerate it. i love so-called "black" comedies. i'm not easily offended, either. it started off okay and quickly went downhill. i laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet), but that was it and didn't compensate for the strong disgust i felt.i didn't laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine. i usually can't see the humor in animals dying (except in animal house). i didn't laugh at much else of the nastiness, either. i turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that i don't care to repeat the details of, only that the wave of nausea still hasn't passed over me. simply put, it was smut-filled and simply not funny with barely any plot. this is one of the times when if you don't have something nice to say, you should get the word out.don't say i didn't warn you.

i wholeheartedly agree with greg in ontario. i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him "that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen." i have seen a lot of movies with this person, and he's pretty forgiving, so i was actually shocked. (the manager gave him a free pass!)i was offended by much of the humor in the film (yes, the baked potato scene was on the top of the list!). my friend and i are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience. for awhile i thought, maybe i just don't get this movie because i'm white. then i realized no one was laughing. the writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent.there were a few funny moments, there was just way too much time between them. even airplane two was funnier than this, and that's saying a lot.i was so dazzled by snoop dogg in starsky and hutch (as huggy bear) that i felt i was sure to enjoy this movie. nope.dl hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was rather small. tom arnold had a few funny moments as "the white guy", but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the mark.sadly, i was not able to award this film a rating with negative stars.

after a humiliating experience on an airplane, nashawn wade (kevin hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full-service airline. what makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses, an on board dance club and no less than captain snoop dogg in the cockpit.soul plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny. soul plane has been described as an "urban" version of airplane. the problem is that soul plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of airplane. the jokes in soul pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. i would be lying if i said i didn't laugh since there were some funny moments. however, i was expecting more and i left the theater disappointed.i would compare soul plane to airplane 2. the latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated, crude jokes. there is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. however, i don't think soul plane is "bottom 100" bad. right now, the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh. i'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either. the running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch. for stupid comedies, you can do a lot worse.no one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps. kevin hart was very annoying as nashawn. he had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. snoop dogg, who was mildly funny in starsky and hutch, completely flunks here. tom arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise. the most annoying person in the movie was ryan pinkston. he was not funny at all and he will never be funny. the funniest cast members were missi pyle and mo'nique. they gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. in the end, soul plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film. rating 4/10

somebody decided to make a "black version" of airplane.somebody decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of airplane.somebody decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes.somebody decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all of its time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast.this movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. if nothing else, it deserves to be remembered for that accomplishment.it's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. a really, really bad thing. picking it apart point-by-point would be a waste of time. the best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it. do yourself a favor... go buy a picture of a purple airplane, and you will have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer.this one definitely goes under the category of "what the !^@@&*! were they thinking????"

having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s, most being quite good to superb, and only very few being mediocre, my opinion is that this one is the worst of all.in fact, i think it's so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series. it's not that the story is so bad, although it's not particularly outstanding in any way, but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters, meaning those other than the regulars in this case. barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer, and who is on a mission of a sort. she practically calls in the role from a phone, and shows no real emotive abilities here. although usually she's never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film/tv roles,usually small parts, she has done much better.arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term 'ham' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area, and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison. and he gets to play a shakespearian actor no less, which gives him more impetus to overact, and he does so.other than these two leads being so weak, the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes. i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens. his reply was, yeah, you're right.skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before.

this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses gabriels horn to open heaven and pull the good angel-dogs out and imprision them on alkatraz. the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad, and at one point, eats a live rat.we got this movie free with a pizza. you get what you pay for.

... because this is yet another dead one. lifeless voice acting, second-rate animation, contrived and un-funny songs (although the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of tim curry), and a weaker plot than land before time 99: fossils on parade.i have to admit, i haven't seen the first film. i'm not a big fan of movies involving heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. still, i hope to see the first one soon, as there had to be a reason someone would create such a god-awful sequel.if i didn't get this movie for free, i wouldn't have it at all. for a 'heaven' flick, the only good thing in this was the devil. 2/10.

seeing the title of this movie "stupid teenagers must die" made me believe this was a spoof of some kind. i discovered later on the original title was "blood and guts". both titles are misleading, though. this is not a spoof, neither a serious splatter movie. this is something in between, failing in both areas. a group of teenagers is attending a séance at a spooky house and then the killing starts. sounds over familiar, doesn't it. well, this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies. and it is badly made. because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy. now this effect can be highly effective, but it isn't in this case. the young cast isn't acting too badly, but the director has no clue as what to do with actors. in numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions, but these are given too late. it could also be an editor's mistake, of course. the characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks. the sound is terrible at times: conversations are undecipherable, but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeed.this is not the worst horror movie i have ever seen, but it still is a bad one. for me a 3 out of 10.

i have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks. i didn't rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick, the next great horror spoof, or the next great low-budget horror spoof. obviously, this isn't meant to scare, but one fatal flaw with the production entirely sapped the joy out of the viewing experience. the sound editing was horrible. i had to work the volume control the entire movie. you can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget spoof - when you're either turning the volume up or down, or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so. the regular dialogue is very low, and all screams, noises, etc., are very loud. we're not talking about toggling between 5 and 7 on the volume control, finding a happy medium at 6. we're talking toggling between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone. again, this movie might be a decent example of what it is meant to be, but you're going to be spending so much time adjusting your volume control that you'll never have the chance to enjoy it.

widow hires a psychopath as a handyman. sloppy film noir thriller which doesn't make much of its tension promising set-up. (3/10)

i'm no jane austen purist but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say.billie piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin-wrong personality,modern make-up,completely wrong hair (there is no way a young lady of her age would have romped around in public with her hair loose and unbrushed like that),she didn't seem particularly meek nor put-upon by the family and i didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind.the picnic(substituted for the ball) was so low-budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the portsmouth section completely destroyed the point of the piece (as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh-so-claustrophobic pink sitting room.)to those responsible:-if you haven't the imagination (even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing jane austen.it was about 10% mansfield park and 90% nothing much at allps edmund was very good

oh dear! the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet, even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. the basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) the cast was generally adequate, but i think billie piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again.

well, this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. and, as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there, the character of fanny price is no where to be found. instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character. at least in the 1999 movie the character they call "fanny price" is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good. this "fanny price" is a complete enigma. someday, i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen. a sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution. she is reserved in manner and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, unfailingly loyal, extremely intelligent, and remarkably astute. a bit of a late bloomer, it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self-possessed young woman. and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most. it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed.

i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read mansfield park...or if they have it was not very well. none of the characters are what they should be: fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while sir thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into aunt norris' personality. additionally, a first person narrative by fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and i would contend that she is not meant to be. additionally, in the movie version, fanny flirts shamelessly with edmund from the very beginning, when they have been raised as brother and sister! austen's fanny would have shrank from flirtation of any sort, and the novel paints the fanny/edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable...as it should be. unlike some other jane austen novels (p&p, emma), mansfield park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. it is a very different sort of novel than the others; it is not meant to be a love story. i watched this movie because i have just now finished reading mansfield park, and i am absolutely horrified by what i see; miss austen is rolling in her grave.

i watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and i returned to some light reading "lobotomy for beginners".it was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.it was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. there were throw-away references to lord nelson and slavery but edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by blake ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century. the other bright-young things had make-up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party - the bleached-blonde fanny, billie piper being the least credible character.uk commercial television obviously believes heaving bosoms, pouting lips and deep meaningful looks make a good story. fortunately jane austen had other ideas.if you want to find out the story of mansfield park, buy the 1983 mini-series dvd.

the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. i should add here that i'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. but sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.i'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. i can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. the acting was extremely thin. the pace of the movie was agonizing. i gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because i didn't want to feel like i was wasting a saturday morning in ny), but with every new scene, it dragged longer, delivering characters in which i took no interest, with which i could not connect, for whom i could not empathize.when i see negative reviews on imdb of small independent films like this, i sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind (something like. . he used to date the gaffer, she dumped him, and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on). but here, nope. i know no one who worked on this film. and i wish it would have been great. but the film wasn't dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those suggest that i connected with the film . . . nope, henry may long was just too long, empty, and tedious. that's the tomas take on this one.

on the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with himmler, the ss and their research branch. it also has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some excellent camera work.however it is a very poor piece of historical work. it has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows.himmler set up a department in the ss for research into the origins of the german race. they went all over the world. they did some things and launched expeditions to all manner of places... (nonoe of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). they wanted to establish that the aryan race and the german people were one and the same thing through historical proof. they didn't find any. the members of this research group were leading professors, members of the ss and therefore linked to the holocaust, and were seen as ok after the war and went on to lead german institutes.these facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people or exonerates them. nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme, the aim of the program is unclear, it hops from topic to topic. the witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported.sadly this programme does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress. the topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on. i would avoid this.also the 'holy grail'is the german bloodline, nothing to do with the holy grail of christian mythology except in passing. mentions of expeditions to look for the christian holy grail are made but never followed through. the title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete.

i really wanted this to be good as i am from liverpool where it is set but it truly awful. the acting from everyone involved is cringeworthy the script is terrible absolutly terrible. terrible

nice attempt to bring shakespearian language alive in a post-apocalyptic setting, but the final result is dreadful. futuristic liverpool is not convincing at all; the budget was obviously not very big, but the production designer could have come up with a slightly more creative approach to the matter. alex cox has made some good films, e.g. repo man and highway patrol man, but i really don't know what he was thinking here. just an opinion.

it is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. if your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? it is with that, i wonder why this version of the ten commandments was written, produced, and aired. i would ask the producers, "what were you thinking? were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?" if perhaps the producers were thinking, "we want to examine this biblical story from another point of view..." then i would say "ok, i watched the show, now what's the point of view?" the premise of this "possible point of view theory" eludes me. i can generally watch programs, and (right or wrong) at least get a sense of what the creators were trying to accomplish. not so, here. i recognize names such as "robert halmi" (the producer) and i can associate his work with some eye catching product; tin man, earthsea, flash gordon, jason and the argonauts. low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comic book entertainment. a perfect genre for sci-fi channel. so i still have to ask robert halmi..."what was the point of this ten commandments, what were you thinking?" fjs

i can't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site. the writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (don't you just hate it when that happens?). and the acting is so very, very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewed.a nut is holding her hostage, children are outside the open screen, so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same children.she's finally free and alone in the house. her chance to go for help, so what does she do? wanders around the house and lies down. she's in the basement, locked away. so what does she do? takes a little nap. come on! most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up. four times! what? if the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention? i think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio, so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action.and the ending is horrendous.the whole movie is completely implausible, horribly written and almost comically acted. beware this movie at all costs!

strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of alan and anya ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by alan ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. wife anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. there are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any al adamson flic), but it's no night of the living dead. director/writer "benjamin" clark, is really bob clark, who went on to create the purile "porky's" early 80's teen exploitation disasters. he has only now resurfaced after 1 inexplicably good movie ("a christmas story") to return to his dreadful ways with "baby geniuses". weirdo alan ormsby later wrote the kinky nastasia kinski/malcolm mcdowell version of "cat people". moocow says check this hippy horror movie out for fun, zombie frolics, and campy dialogue :=8)

"i haven't laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer," says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all those val lewton and george a. romero walking-dead movies we have come to love (or loath, depending on your personal taste) through the years. in this story, a young actor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after, one spooky night, they visit a cemetery island. their artistic director, alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual.way too much screen time is misspent; the amateur dialog includes lame witticisms, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries (and can't alan stop that irritating laughter... way too much!). once the action kicks in (which comes close to the end of this film), it's worth the wait. i saw this one on a late-night, local station television program that ran films very much like this one... only this one scared me at the age of 13... but then again, you might laugh your way through it, until the bitter end... ...which is probably the reason, nowadays, why very few people still wear striped hip-huggers.

it seems like an exciting prospect, a modern-dress "othello" with christopher eccleston, who was so frighteningly good in "shallow grave" and (especially) "jude," and eamonn walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on "oz." one would think them both natural shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: walker's othello is a fairly cookie-cutter take on the part, with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and eccleston hams it up appallingly as iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role. it's likely he was egged on by his director, whose florid approach might have worked better with elizabethan language, but who seems a jarring, pretentious choice for this modernized screenplay. and the screenplay itself is less disappointing in being modern than it is in being obvious  it's as if andrew davies sketched out the famous plot and then just wrote whatever dialogue first popped into his head. all in all, a failure. 4 out of 10.

othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film. the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters, and the terrible rendition of the love that desi & john had, made this movie the horrendous filth that it is. by far, othello, directed by jeffery saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi. their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend. in the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. moments later, ben jago, john's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is. by far, this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself. with that being said, it does have a miniscule amount of good parts. for example, the love that was shown between john and desi, was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should. love, jealously, deceitfulness, this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel. the novel however, really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could. for example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. much more detail is also put into the novel. this is why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will find it disappointing as well. in conclusion, this film was by far, the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind. by avoiding to see this film, not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives, but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben jago popping out at them.

it's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare's othello, by bringing it to modern day context. however, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, john othello, played by eamonn walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of keeley hawes, dessie brabant, eventually ending in dessie's death. ben jago, played by christopher eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. he didn't give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello, with michael cass, played by richard coyle. instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she "was" cheating. in the play, it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything. this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons, than what the book was based off of. however, the movie did have a few good points. it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks, where othello is the main chief of the police squad. these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds, and burning fires. you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie, more so than you can in the book. this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand, than the shakespearian times it was written in. in the play iago (jago) gets tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction, and gets othello's position. he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late. i saw this as a downfall in the movie, because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying, and in the book, he is found out by rodrigo. overall, the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did. i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow, or make it more of a tragedy. i would say that you should read the book first, in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you may find yourself lost, and confused.

in all the episodes, i never saw any real action or drama or comedy.the plot is so repetitive.****somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it.sowhile i watched about 30 of these, i realized...there is no drama....nobody ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air-plane.there are no car chases or explosions- not even a horse race with old carriages.all those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree...what gives? no pshycos, no axe-murders, no-gun-totting old englishmen in bad suits...just yap yap yap...you have an old tea set and it came from the country of germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah...i'm still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it, but no...it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy englishman or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in boston or china during the ming dynasty - big effin deal.can't anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for ransom? is there no alien spacecraft that will obliterate the entire floor? who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake? this is about as entertaining as watching paint dry - only with commentary.there's no sex, there's no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts.this show sucks! what ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon? antiques roadshow - more like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show...

it is very possible that i simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me (something similar happened with triplets of belleville), but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate, an exchange student from japan, immediately started laughing at the movie, saying that it sounded dumb. now, i don't agree that it is dumb, the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled. it's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time.but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me. it has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning, especially because you already knew it anyway. the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits, for example, are indeed repulsive.there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp, but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else. there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it.as i said about triplets of belleville, this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim, or its japanese counterpart, but an academy award nominated film? it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from.

i love japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. so it's obvious i am not afraid of japanese films. however, sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to westerners. they might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. it's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating simulators or katamari damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-japanese. this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted, such as american football, fried snicker bars and paris hilton! well the king of strange japanese films that just don't seem right to americans might just be atama-yama. now the style of animation isn't the issue--it's different but nice enough. no, it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending. that's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this: there was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing out of his head. it was little at first and he simply cut it away, but again and again it grew back--so he just decided to let it go. and, after a while, people began living on his head under the shade of the tree. oddly, while they were under the tree, they were tiny but when they left, they were full sized again. then, after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree, the man drown himself(!?) in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was! the end.see! i told you this was very, very odd--but not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakuris--just odd. o-d-d....odd! and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing, i doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this oscar-nominated film did not win. frankly, that makes me happy, as i really don't want this film to spur on such similar films. the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice, but not spectacular animation.this film made my brain hurt....i hope that isn't a sign that i have a tree!

this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. robert taylor has been primed by corporate head burl ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. he sends him to england to negotiate a deal, where taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. he comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives. he attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. it could have been gritter, nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics.somehow the costume design was nominated (undeservedly) for an oscar - it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work yet again, no doubt.what is stiking however is the black and white cinemascope cinematography which is excellent - this if anything deserved the oscar nom. (it was mgm's first 'scope film in b&w).not as good as it could have been but not terrible either.

this feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. the whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.but there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!)the shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. and i liked peter hayes impressions of charles laughton and ronald coleman as well.

the stage star grace hayes stars in this obscure little film. after years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. the kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.interestingly, it turns out that mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college. so, she has the idea of forcing the young man to mature. she talks to the man who's raising peter and has his allowance cut off completely--hoping he'll rise to the occasion. it also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible.now here's where it gets pretty dumb. to show that they know the value of hard work, she hires a bunch of them to sing and dance at the malt shop she just purchased. talk about contrived!! what happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a judy garland/mickey rooney musical! i'd suggest the kids try to do something else to earn money...or perhaps sing and dance until people pay them to stop! i know i would pay them.considering that the talent is far from talented, peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous, the whole thing is a bit hard to take. not a very good film by any sane standard, this is an obscure film that should have stayed obscure! by the way, it is interesting that ms. hayes' son in the film, peter, is actually her real life son. the only problem with that is that peter lind hayes is a truly awful actor. he's not handsome enough to be a leading man and he comes off as either dull and uninteresting or downright obnoxious. in particular, all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the gelatin that you scrape off spam. despite this terrible performance, he did go on to have a reasonably successful acting career. who would have believed it if you'd seen him in zis boom bah--because here, he's about as welcome as the bubonic plague!!

oh gawd. i want to time travel back to monogram studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. it is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.i just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view. the weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper grace hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat-bag son is rich college clown. she's gonna fix his playboy ways, no matter what.her real life son (weird looking) peter hays plays her screen son. his real life wife plays her secretary. talk about nepotism. i suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire sam katzman. as with other monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that monogram pictures are 'lavish' in their b grade ways. have a ghastly look at swing parade of 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it. story? none. anyway zis boom bah is more bah than boom. where was gale storm and mantan mooreland when monogram really needed them? probably standing at the boom gate of prc pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. junior jive hepster roland dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers, especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe/club set. the usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall, and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. the chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. they have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen... all the girls look like they are all called joyce. there is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot-pants...on one leg only. it is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in zis being actually fun. the one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between grace and her son/daughter in law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic. she has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. the dupree kid is the real star. he can actually do something...in spite of looking like a tubby liberace tap dancing teen... you read that right.

having some idle time before going to work, i looked at my "50 movie pack comedy classics" dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes. "classics" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public domain. anyway, this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy (who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in, louisiana) with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall, taking a break from the east side kids, as peter's buddy. the plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag. and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though i did like his funny dance). since this was only 61 minutes that i'm sure played on the lower-half of the double feature bill, i'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying.

the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional midwick college, which peter kendricks (peter lind hayes) attends due to the largesse of stage actress grace hayes, his real-life mother who fills the same role here, and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary (healy) who is his real-life wife. drably directed from a weak script, and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing, this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and has nice turns by soprano healy, benny rubin as a snack shop proprietor, and the dynamic tap dancing roland dupree.

i had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. the bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. for the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-tv-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session. for the next 27 or so hours we are treated to two idiotic psychotics who for some reason seem compelled to drive through the desert southwest together, going after each other like a demented abbot & costello. even with the "shocking" twists at the end, we are merely left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and director/writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should for creating this inconsistent, incoherent nonsense.

the setup for "nature of the beast" is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman jack (a very domesticated lance henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker adrian (eric roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against jack. oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'hatchet man' is dismembering people in the desert. sounds great, right? sort of like "the hitcher" meets "psycho." one or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems! well, unfortunately, writer-director victor salva (of "jeepers creepers" and "powder" fame) doesn't have enough ideas to keep the movie going, the scenario arouses no tension or suspense (poison for what is supposedly a 'thriller'), and the inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone seems out-of-place. henriksen evokes an unusual, not-quite-earthbound everyman (even sporting an ample gut), but roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in "death wish 3"; we're never sucked in to the point where we actually care about what's happening, and the conclusion slides into improbable territory (i kept thinking it was going to be "fight club" all over again, but i was mistaken). too bad. "nature of the beast" could have been something else...instead of nothing else.

personally i've watched it because of lea thompson's appearance and i didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly i kept watching it until the end.let's face it - it just one of the saga-like stories and isn't particularly original or entertaining, but strangely it just keeps you by the tv. my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldn't be one point that i just don't get.there is lovely and really touchy scene in which lea thompson's character is running on the street holding baby in her arms, the snow is falling, she is cold, scared, and has no place to stay, she doesn't know what to do next. and then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about.i just don't get it - i don't see how is it possible that she would do such thing, it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival. after this character flip i just couldn't enjoy rest of the movie.

the critics were like "a movie that will break your heart" etc. so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie.i'll make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content. this movie tries to touch you, to reach your heart. but it fails. at least for me. and for my friend, too.everything that happened happened only on the screen. it was always there, not here, where i am. i thought most of the time "hmm, something's happening on the screen, but it's only on the screen. it's not real."movies which succeeded much better in touching me: east of eden (1955), terms of endearment (1983), jerry maguire (1996), babe (1995), mies vailla menneisyyttä (2002)

american graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. i've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it. (i graduated from high school in 1962.) however, more american graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made.it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel. the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (i served 18 months in vietnam with the 101st airborne division.) the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it.if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies, more american graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong.

were it not for the fact that this came as a 2-dvd set paired with the original american graffiti; were it not for the fact that i've been here in iraq for several months and, at this point, will watch pretty much anything, i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes. this movie was appallingly bad on so many levels i just don't know where to start. poorly acted, shot, directed, written, scored, edited. my 9-year old daughter's first forays into film-making are superior to this - and she was filming the dog sleeping. (come to think of it, i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars. but i'm biased.) if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality film-making, then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs. no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in english. i'll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is.

i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti, do not see this movie. if you haven't seen the original, i still don't recommend this, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. the characters from the first film are great, and by the end you fell a connection to them. this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. it's a chore to watch!set on new year's eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film. in '64, we have john milner (paul le mat) who is now a professional drag racer. he meets a foreign girl eva, and though his plot really goes nowhere, it's the best of the four. in 1965, we have toad (charles martin smith) who is stuck in vietnam, and more than anything, he wants out. he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out. in '66, we have debbie (candy clark), the girl who toad picked up in the first movie. now she is a pot smoking hippie, and really i'm not sure what her plot was about. it was her going to a concert...not much of anything happened. finally, in 1967, steve bolander (ron howard) and laurie bolander (cindy williams) are having marriage problems that end in a anti-war rally and police action.none of these stories are very good. the script in some parts features very, very bad dialogue. these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film, ended up where they are here...why? why was this sequel made? i guess if a sequel was made, it had to feature the vietnam war, and hippies and police action, but the real thing is that this movie shouldn't have been made.the direction was stylish, but it just amounts in a huge headache. each story has a different style. milner's is just a regular (depending on how you watch it) wide screen, and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be. toad's plot was shot in 16mm, and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture, which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen. debbie's plot is shot in multi-screen. at one point there might have been one screen, but for the good majority, it's anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once. don't bother trying to follow the screens, since there's nothing going on anyways. steve and laurie's plot has the weirdest filming style. it's style really doesn't mean anything, and is dumb and pointless. instead of just a full widescreen, it's a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen. though i don't like the others, at least i understand what they were going for, this one just doesn't make sense.the music is this movie's saving grace, not that it could save this! bob dylan, simon and grafunkel, stevie wonder, marvin gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here. they don't save the feature, they just make it a little better than it is. it's still bad! overall, this is a pointless sequel. any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel! my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. pg for language, drug use and violence

this is absolutely awful. it's everywhere & nowhere & doesn't have any sort of point. i have never understood what is good about jeff garlin or sarah silverman. bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w/people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so-called "script" & thought, "yeah i wanna do that!" most movies i can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. there is zero of that in this. it's extremely dumb. there really isn't any other word to describe this. this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time. skip this at all cost, you'll be glad you did.

how i deserved to watch this crap??? worst ever. the acting was awful, when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile, once - or twice, but.... if you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives, this is the right movie. i recommend just look in a wall or something, anything else but watch this "film". yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women, i guarantee it will be more entertaining :)the actor in this one (i forgot his name) is not that bad, and i am surprised how hi accepted the role. anyway "i want someone to eat cheese with" is the right film if you want to punish someone.

i don't know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary, the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably every time! several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year, perhaps decade! i mean when i say the cg looks like daytime tv, i'm giving daytime tv a bad name, i've seen better stuff on the sci-fi channel. who i really feel sorry for is the actors,(that they have their names attached to this film) they did a good job, i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good, but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the gutter. whats really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets, if you have seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to spot the reuse of some of the buildings. however what i thought was the worst thing about this film, even above the cg problems was the main demon, he was just not scary in anyway, his form, the way he talked, he was extremely bland. all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it weren't for my wife wanting to see the end.

i saw "mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.it is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction, poor plot line and 2-dimensional characterisation.i did, however, know this when i went in. i was willing to trust the two gentleman that i went with (knowledgable comic buffs) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were. unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict. though, this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction. the pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures.i would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing. i have tried with neil gaiman's work but am always left with the "emperor's new clothes" feeling. i live in hope but last night was no exception.i do not think i can continue with an analysis of gaiman's work without losing the will to live. read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described. i cannot comprehend, however, how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl, nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility, or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother. these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination. all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.

i didn't really hate mirrormask. i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. the movie begins with a young girl named helana who works in a circus. but while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus. during a heated argument with her mother, helana wishes she would drop dead. bad move. the mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. on the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she "finds herself". personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming. the early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block. but a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to cgi land where nearly everything is a computer image. the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the wizard of oz seemed enticing to explore mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image. there's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece) they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten. helana and her sidekick valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. overall mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash. stick to the real world kids.

so many people loved this movie, yet there are a few of us imdb reviewers who found mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse-clenchingly boring. i fall into the latter of these two camps, and i will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.firstly, to set the record straight - i like neil gaiman's books. i sometimes find his knowing, sarcastic, 'wry asides' humour a little geeky, and i actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but, even with his occasional lapses into crap 'dad' gags, i find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.interestingly, one of gaiman's strongest works is coraline, a gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. his latest novel (anansi boys) overdoes the funnies, and tends to read at times like terry pratchett does the sisters of mercy (not the nuns but the band). mirrormask inhabits similar territory to coraline, and when i saw the stunning visuals in the trailer, i got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.in praise of the film, some sequences do look stunning. however, the visual effects are occasionally ruined by cgi animation that looks like a media studies student project. backgrounds and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character animation looks clumsy, amateur and cheap. in an early dream sequence, the spider is animated beautifully, but the book-eating cat-beast looks poorly rendered and very 'computer generated'. compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as 'the corpse bride', mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. however, in mirrormask's defence, the budget was tiny for such a grand vision, and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.what cannot be forgiven is the stilted, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. the actors struggle desperately with the dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. conversation is rendered completely unnatural, the jokes fall flat time and time again, and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer's only method of plot exposition. combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'phantom menace') - this renders the film almost unwatchable. in such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed, and in the main they fail terribly. the girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage-school dialogue, and occasionally shows real promise, but it is never enough. the god-awful cod-'oirish' of the valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. it appears to be valentine's job to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add a bit of light relief. personally, i wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.what else is wrong with this film? answer....rob brydon. what's annoying (for us brits, anyway) is we know rob brydon can act! we've seen him hold the screen for half-an-hour on his own (doing those 'marion & geoff' monologues), and in the first 'real world' bit of the film he is fine. however, stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am-dram-ham i've seen in years. a real shame.what else is wrong? answer... the wanky slap-bassing, sub-courtney pine saxing and unlistenable, too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never shuts up. god, the music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant and, if that isn't enough, has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. it makes the dialogue very hard to hear, but that could be a blessing in disguise.what else is wrong with it? answer.... the whistling mime artist. in modern society there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in france. every moment the camera lingers on the gurning, whistling, moss-juggling, yogurt-weaving idiot, i understand why the edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when festival time comes round again.my final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. surrealism often is dull  it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike, zen, accepting state, or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. a story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked, whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.finally, apologies to all those who found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. you have managed to suspend your disbelief, you have seen past the creaky cgi, ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted, and understood the maker's grand, imaginative vision. i wanted to, but i couldn't see past the real-world failings that dragged it down.i hope neil gaiman gets it right next time, if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.

there are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind "the ransom of red chief"! even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. glenn ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. donna reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. leslie nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. the son is such a repulsive little brat, i found myself rooting for the kidnappers. the only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler. perhaps i'm being too harsh on the actors, after all, all they did were to read the lines given them in the script. ah, the script, that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach.

by 1971 it was becoming more and more obvious that hammer film studios were on the way out . hands of the ripper is a case in point where even the idea smacks of desperation - the spirit of jack the ripper posses his own daughter ! yeah okay no one was expecting a documentary but this plot seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for stupid premise and you do find yourself questioning why on earth the producers brought jack the ripper into the story . was this to give the movie a snappy title ? the production values are unimpressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap tvm feel but you know you're not going to be watching a classic hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is laughably inappropriate . i think the composer was trying to make the theme tune haunting and touching but the music resembles something out of a soppy romantic movie . i will give the cast some credit as they do take their roles seriously in what's a far from serious movie i didn't enjoy this film much and it instantly reminded me of the phantom raspberry blower of london town from the two ronnies which i'd been laughing at in the weeks before i saw this

i've watched this film a few times and i never really liked it. i'm not a fan so termed "nu horror", so i can't be dismissed on that account. i found it a little sleazy, i think the thing that irks me about hammers is the sexploitation aspect, not sex mind you, but sexploitation. i'm surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly, so i'll have another look at it. but for me, it wasn't creepy, it had no atmosphere, just a bit of "omigod, look at those bad/stupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man, ooherh!" i suppose ultimately for me, the film had no depth whatsoever, just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value. this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like, but the sets are even too clunky and dull impart a sense of victorian menace. roger corman's horrors on the other hand, now that's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. for me, this was just exploitative, flat footed trash.

strained and humorless (especially in light of its rather dubious psychology), but well-paced and comfortably lurid, this genteel body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of angharad rees as a young woman periodically possessed by jack the ripper, thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the edwardian propriety. it's all pretty standard stuff for hammer, but is handled with a good deal of visual elan, even if the central relationship, between psychoanalyst porter and rees, drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.

hands of the ripper aspect ratio: 1.85:1sound format: monoan edwardian doctor (eric porter) uses newfangled freudian analysis on a young girl (angharad rees) who turns out to be the daughter of jack the ripper, and just as deadly...unlikely hammer horror, in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal, even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements (broken mirrors, hat-pins, etc.)! l.w. davidson's screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the material's inherent subtext (porter's obvious attraction to rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued throughout. some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for hammer, and these were clipped from the original us release (despite an r rating from the mpaa), though the complete version is now available on home video. porter and rees give excellent performances, and the climax in st. paul's cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting. directed by peter sasdy.
