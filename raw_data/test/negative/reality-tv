end of days, starts off pretty well, arnie plays a down and out cop (a very similar character to riggs in lethal weapon) and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment.sadly it fails to deliver, arnie is as good as we we have come to expect, but as for gabriel byrne i expect him to chose his roles more carefully than this. cast as the devil; this is probably the weakest portrayal of the lord of darkness ever.this movie gets a little too daft for me, and the end sequence, aside from being very weak, is visually one of the worst i've seen in recent years, cgi is have been better than this since the early nineties.quite simply not good enough. 4/10 (watch it if you have too, but don't expect too much, cause it won't deliver)

why are there no good reviews? because this film is hysterically bad.set in a japanese prison camp in world war ii, we have jim brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the japanese officers brown nose jim brown's character.this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. the sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.this is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun. this film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to deliver. and believe me, i was alive in the seventies, and we thought crap like this was just as stupid then. it was never popular.

if you are in to bad movies for the entertainment of witnessing bad movies, bad acting, bad production etc..aka mystery science theater 3000 quality....you will love pacific inferno. jim brown will be forever remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game...as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game... i am not sure who rolf bayer was...but i am hoping he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed this, perhaps he may have been the next spielberg in the making...because if he was a grown man directing this...a 15 or 16 year old could have done better.... the basis or plot for the movie probably had some historical merit and maybe even truthfully accurate...but the actual film may be one of worst movies made in american film history...i kept waiting for lee marvin, william holden or charles bronson to pop in to somehow save whatever "face" was left of this film. i would have loved to have been at the red carpet, black tie gala for the hollywood opening when this movie previewed...as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath... it is on the dime dvd racks now....look for it for entertainment value...this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up...

the best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the pearl harbor attack in tora tora tora. my favorite was the shot of the p-40 crashing into the row of parked p-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. unfortunately it just gets worse from there.there's two black guys and two white guys as american pows, as well as some filipinos pows and japanese guards. the ranking pow of the americans is a white naval lieutenant, which is of course an o-3 in the navy. at any rate, he's in need of a haircut, badly, distractingly badly. hockey hair does not belong in a wwii movie. oh, and he's a racist. he doesn't want to share quarters with the 'negros'. of course in real life, he wouldn't want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either. i think the geneva convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasn't the point here. oh well, i think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick. he gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the divers.but once you get going, it's not a bad story line. the japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the americans before corrigador fell. the filipino resistance wants them to take their time. and the pows do their best to help. a potentially good story and not that badly done i guess. a bit unbelievable when the pows use camp made re-breathers to swim between the pow camp and the filipino village, every night. maybe i'm not that picky when i know going in that this is not a blockbuster film. i guess that's why it comes on a 20-pack dvd war movie collection for five bucks.the 70s music did not belong in this movie or any wwii movie. it's quite distracting to say the least. the acting was not that bad. probably better than i could do.not being a fan of football, at least i found out that jim brown is a real person and not somebody richard pryor made up. that in itself was worth the 25Â¢ i paid for this movie.worth watching on tcm or paying a quarter for. one star for being a war movie, another for being wwii and one more because i'm feeling generous.

jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the philippines just after the japanese invasion. the story has the japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that macarthur had dumped into the manila bay.it's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (the film uses edwin mccain's war in a not so subtle montage). the performances are just adequate at best. jim brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed. the sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap. the film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the japanese attack in tora! tora! tora!. the use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching. for me the film seems to have half a real plot, the retrieval of the silver, and half a plot that is there just to fill time. none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale.given the choice i'd take a pass.

jim varney's first real movie is quite a delight, but don't come in expecting to see ernest p. worrel any time soon. i felt the wide array of characters varney depicted were great, but without being said, the rest of the movie should be put into a mulcher or something. a rather odd beginning for a movie icon.

irwin allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish "epic" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the earth. potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. varied players from walter pigeon and joan fontaine to frankie avalon and barbara eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. good for a few stray laughs, but allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense. later a popular tv series. ** from ****

first, i should say that i've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. this version is as flat as a lifetime movie on adultery. there's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of tv ads for it. according to entertainment weekly, bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. guess what??! that was booth's intent. it was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled manhattan socialites. the crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. they pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. bette midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any context in this version. she mentions going after "buck," which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. this movie is so dull that i'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that i found unbelievable: > mary haines bragging to her domestic staff: "i can suck the nails out of a board!" right. great writing. norma shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an oscar nom, right? > a compassionate sylvia fowler!!!??? annette bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. claire booth used sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. as portrayed immortally by rosalind russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. she wasn't above biting paulette godard's ankle. the 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. in killing her off, they killed the movie.

i believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based. when hollywood first started talking about such enterprise, the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and that's exactly where things begin souring here, with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work, but that are not suited to the parts, and sadly enough, have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material.it seems as if there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film. this is called an updating, as in let's drain the story out of humor, snappy dialogue, and any interesting premise. most of all, let's prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't really get (at least by watching this film) where the women are truly going.for starters, casting meg ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances, even after 20 years of working in the movies. her mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's, somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes, like dorothy in "the wizard of oz" by learning, observing, and realizing that she had a choice in the matter. it might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays, but it was fun ride, and part of the fun, was the catty, silly, sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime. in here, we are down to earth with a thud. by changing the nature of sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its spark, and it isn't in anyway annette bening's fault. i couldn't help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled. thankfully i entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. her sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could have been a great creation. unfortunately ms. english wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction.yet that wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all. in the original, we have joan crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman. her crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, duplicitous maneuvers, and some very sexy poses. she was the link between the male and the female, and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about. she provided the tension between men and women. she was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. a woman of intelligence that we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. eva mendes, as gorgeous as she is, is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing, and once again, some bad casting.there are more atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role for mensing as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies, and the rather annoying lesbian turn by pinkett. then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie, as bette middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her make up, shows the spark of what could have been. her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken. her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film, and it is exciting to see that it could really fly, then she is gone. she is in the film all of six minutes, and she fades away in the middle of the muddle.here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us, a film that could have joined the successful "sex in the city" who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise. it gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. it truly updated what had made it successful before. "the women" in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself, much like "the hulk" did it this year, find more suitable performers, a really good writer, and most of all, someone who truly treasures what good movies are about.

as a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake. i went to see "the women" the remake of one of my all time favorites. i've seen the original many many times, in fact i own it. my rushing to see the remake was based on diane english, the woman responsible for "murphy brown" my though was: how bad can it be? she must know what she's doing. well, i don't know what to say. i don't understand what happened. the botoxed women is a rather depressing affair. meg ryan or whoever played mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryan...another actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask - she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what norma shearer did in 1939. the new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. the "friends" annette bening, debra messing, jada pinket smith are as disconnected as anything i've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: eva mendes as crystal, the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. eva mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up. i didn't give it a 1 out respect for candice bergen and cloris leachman

insane really. even if you haven't seen the original george cukor movie with norma shearer, joan crawford, rosalind russell, paulette goddard, joan fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. depressing for many different reasons. meg ryan for one. what has she done to herself? her face can hardly move. that alone puts her miles away from norma shearer. annette bening should be suing the dp and debra messing, what the hell was she doing here? actresses with no connection in the public's subconscious trying to pass for friends, totally unconvincingly. eva mendes in the joan crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting. what a terrible idea! her character is like a trans-gender performer without any taste or subtlety. bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women.the only positive things i can mention are a short but very funny appearance by bette midler and cloris leachman as the housekeeper.

i'm sorry but i cannot even partly agree with some comments on this awful piece of sh...english is not my native language, because i'm a german citizen, so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammar structures or something *gg i cannot understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3??? are you kidding me? this movie has completely no sense, not even a seem of good acting...when i looked at the comments on the da vinci code, which has - i think - nearly the same rating, i had to bang my head on the table , because i watched 00 schneider directly after sakrileg, and oh my god , there are worlds between them.the majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 6.3 and denominates helge as a genius. of course , he knows how to make money, but i think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact, that german isn't your native language and you just ignore - or rather don't notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences. ok , i must confess that some scenes are funny, but all in all , a 6.3 is just too much for my compatriot ;)

every once in a while, an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't-miss, but the movie sucks. some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are "levity" and "the safety of objects", and now here's "the united states of leland".said awesome cast includes ryan gosling, kevin spacey, don cheadle, jena malone, lena olin, michelle williams, chris klein, and kerry washington. gosling plays leland p. fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child), but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive. don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him), and jena malone is his ex-girlfriend. we see their deteriorating relationship (due to her heroin addiction) in flashback. sounds like an awesome little drama, huh? i thought so, too. the fact is that this movie is just badly, badly written. the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches, and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways, it glosses over his crime. for the most part, there's no problem with the acting. gosling (who was oscar-worthy in "the believer") is a tremendously talented young actor, but the way they're written, none of these characters (least of all leland) even feel like real people, so there's not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad. jena malone is the most memorable. she has one of the most expressive faces i've ever seen. even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with one look. when she's got good material to work with (as in "donnie darko" or "the dangerous lives of altar boys"), she's really amazing. but this is not good material. maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile, but as it is, "the united states of leland" is ponderous, inert, and for a movie that seems in love with how "deep" it is, it's really shallow.

how much do i love this film?! now i'm not a fan of bad films, but i do love a film that is so bad it's good. this is one of those. juan pablo di pace has a great butt, looks fab on screen, and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut (i believe). billy zane is suitably mean and moody, though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him. i felt it in titanic, the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example, totally broken, shocked, and put-down ... fierce! kelly brook is a pretty face ... no seriously, i think that's it! it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy, some big bra fillers from brook, nasty growling from billy, laugh at the dialogue, revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair ... i'm gona go watch it again now - yes, i bought it!!!

first off, i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island. it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out. looked interesting. watched it, and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan pablo di pace and omg i could not believe it, this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie?? it is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and edt or florida time. you can check your showtime listings by title and see it. i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off, you see her naked body.... when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on. funny, there are a lot of other mess ups too. i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie... go figure! wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime, ha ha. good laugh. i give it 1-1/2 stars. c-, d+ movie.

"three" is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. masquerading as a psychological thriller, it's closest relative is the monumentally superior "dead calm" (also featuring billy zane). "dead calm" provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidman's grieving parents attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. they end up being terrorised by zane's adrift psycho-killer. it provided sharp, increasingly ratcheted suspense, a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded."three" suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the principal players. zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. in "dead calm" he was menacing, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? ms brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. they do, however, succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. the guy playing the voodoo-hexed manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. in fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun).plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible.i'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd. the reason for this is it's not very good. if you want something decent along these lines, get "dead calm." it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema.

80's sleazy (glam)rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. the only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago, so we can laugh at its sillyness. too bad 'rock star' has no laughs at all, as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years.chris (mark wahlberg) is singer of a steel dragon tribute band. when he's kicked of the band at the same time the real steel dragon singer is kicked of as well, he becomes the next lead singer. you already know how this is gonna end up at that time, with chris losing it with sex, drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriend/manager, emily (jennifer aniston).there's way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost. watch the (over-rated, but still more fun) almost famous instead, or even better, a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions, that thing you do.what a stinker. 2/10.

in my opinion, the movie was laughable--bad dialogue. whoever wrote the script--please keep your day job. it's definitely no godfather or goodfellas. it's good to be on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words. some of the characters were clowns. but what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors.

wow, what a racist, profane piece of celluloid garbage, and what an insult to the great genre of westerns.exploitive? sex scenes abound, profanity abounds, violence and gore abounds.....everything that gives modern movies such a good name, especially among those who prefer classic-era movies. this is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against today's films. somehow i just can't picture nude male bathing scenes in randolph scott or gene autrey films. nor can i picture hearing "motherf---er!" exclaimed here and there. i sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago. yet, the f-word is so prevalent here you'd think you were watching a story centered in today's urban areas, not the old west of the 1800s.prejudice? well, what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty, brutal villain? do you think someone might complain about a racist movie? home come we don't hear an outcry when the reverse - as demonstrated in this film - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country?mario van peeples wrote, directed and starred in this bomb. remember that name. apparently, he is the "ed wood" of today's filmmakers. even spike lee wouldn't be this racist. you can't get much worse than this movie.

this is the worst movie of all time! it's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1/3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet. if you actually watch the whole thing, god help you.

it's not just that the movie is lame. it's more than that. this movie is just unnecessary. do we need another western? how about a western with afro-americans in the titles roles? sound stupid, implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre? it is. incredibly lame and simple minded. it's like that lame baz luhrman film "romeo and juliet" where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale. well, baz luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-american cast is racist in itself. it's also puerile and simple minded (like baz luhrman-man he's a bad director). hey (i hear you say) this was directed by mario van peebles! he's also in the film! how can it be racist? it's not. i said the idea of casting all afro-americans instead of caucasians was. the film isn't racist, it's just pointless, stupid and very very boring.
