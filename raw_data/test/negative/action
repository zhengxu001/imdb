first of all, i would like to say that i am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that i rented it, i wanted to like it.i think that the main reason that i was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller. in my eyes, a suspense thriller for british movies is like something out of a ruth rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.this movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. we have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.his notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.the elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, i felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. the film might have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.this seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. i felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. i felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. so, i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.

i'm a huge fan of both emily watson (breaking the waves) and tom wilkinson (normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett (dellamorte dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich lord are spot-on and entertaining. but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. the music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice. too bad.i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. for example, watson's character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. and i went from disliking wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a "love story" or "steel magnolias" illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (was it the lord driving the car? the lord's dog?). the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, florence nightingale incarnate, etc. was ok until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. good god! if you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.look, everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. i'm not anti pc or anything, it just didn't ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. the ending for me was (and not the director's intention i am certain) depressing. the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together, so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. is that asking too much?my score: 4/10

three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. the three businessmen take revenge, which escalates to a murder after another. supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people.the plot has too many holes. the details were ignored in order to move the story forward. the acting was uneven. the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd. the small budget and tight schedule were apparent. the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight, and the ending was just unbelievable.

i would put death wish 3 in the same box as stallone's cobra and commando. the box that i would sell for $2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside. the story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash. why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk. the story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. i mentioned cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. both this movie and cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips? this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 4.

i was disappointed with the third film in the "death wish" series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into bronson. he is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t.v. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a-team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a-team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated. the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. the plot is something out of an episode of "highway to heaven" and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from bronson's revenge against the bad guys. skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend.

this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian falangist party - or some similar group... the strong man (kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. the only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what i mean...it's a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie... :(

this movie lacked credibility for two reasons. one, no mayor of a major city, and new york is certainly as major as it gets. would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, jewish or defenseless. at 62-years of age, i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. even "escape from new york," which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. in this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. also, in this movie and i have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the "escape" movie. secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. why did the outside gangs come to help? i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. what did they come for? another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson's character? this was not a great movie and i could go on, but i won't.

eric roberts "stars" in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film. he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. though evil by most people's standards, his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with "lethal weapon" electric prods.the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. thomas has clint eastwood's squinter eyes, dolph lundgren's one-liners, the acting abilities of jcvd and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.martin "cobra kai" kove's career shares this low point with roberts, in the film it is difficult to tell if kove's character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if kove just came that way. i couldn't blame him if he did.fortunately for all involved, this movie has a "so bad that it's good" quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do.

2001 wasn't perhaps eric roberts best year. both raptor and this came out. watched raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being erics worst. but that had it´s share moment of fun and d-standard. this one doesn't have a thing.tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days. the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves.the two thing that stands out are martin kove and eric roberts. you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism.i say thank you roberts see you next time (and hopefully a better one).

enjoy the opening credits. they're the best thing about this second-rate but inoffensive time-killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove. the main part, however, goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who, nevertheless, occasionally manages to project a banty-rooster kind of belligerence. the first time we see him he's bare-chested, sweaty, and engaged in that favorite "beefcake" activity -- chopping wood. after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in "lethal weapon." he could use a better script, however, since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing. there's also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained. there are a few pluses, though. sending "john woodrow" undercover as "john wilson" is an amusing play on a presidential name, and co-star jody (ross) nolan shows promise as an inmate who, early in the proceedings, is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard. one final note: the movie's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras." despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 inmates! (note: the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful. for the record, the burly, bald-headed guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback, and the young, fair-haired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail.)

this is slightly less sickening than the first two films, but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. charles bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. crime, you see, is up 11% in the south belmont area... so what's to be done? a stronger police presence? tougher jails? harsher sentences? nope, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge  or, as the writers would have it, justice: this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief ed lauter.the writers bend over backwards to make kersey the hero, sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection, and supplying a scene in which kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back, to applause from the watching crowd. capital punishment for theft? well, okay. the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer kersey on or back him up is appalling.sure, these villains are scum, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind, rather than slanting the entire thing towards kersey and his mindless answer? funnily enough the beleaguered residents don't fear gang reprisals or blame kersey for any of the violence, which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of kersey's involvement. at the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre, never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being.the atrociously shallow performances don't help  bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put inflection on the right words. new heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun? a rocket launcher?!  and new lows of misogyny: the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion, like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. this is dreck, pure and simple, mindless garbage put together without style or sense.

when the legends die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull, a champion bronc rider. raised in the old ways, tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. bitter about the role he has been forced into, tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. the movie has richard widmark in the role of red, the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager. red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. the real story is completely ignored, the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas. oh well, you should read the book, this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice.

the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low-key character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest. there's a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted.

"death wish 3" is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. all the characters (apart from bronson's paul kersey, of course) exist merely to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the villains). the director simply pours on the mindless violence (people even get burned alive and blown up), turning this into an urban version of "commando" (and charlie, like arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire). fans of this short of thing (and, apparently, there are many) will enjoy it, others....beware. (*1/2)

ok, i just flipped channels and caught dw3. i watched it knowing it would be trash..but..as a person who has seen tons of films, this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen...i'm not kidding. it is so bad you have to watch it, like a bad accident you can't turn away from. sometimes these kinds of films work, ie, troma movies...but watching martin balsam and charles bronson slum it up like this is painful....what's even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1/10??? i can't believe it made it past 1.5! equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series...somehow this garbage warranted part 4 and 5? and to top it all off, some dude's comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time??? statements like that scare me about this world!

naked deanna troi! richie's brother chuck (from "happy days") with a reverse mohawk!death wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where chuck bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window.chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away.all i can say about death wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible "serious" movies that i have ever seen--loaded to the hilt with mayhem, and nearly zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score.as i understand it, bronson disowned this film, but happily cashed the check from golan globus.if you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you're in for a cheap "jackass" kind of thrill, check it out.

the 3rd in the series finds paul kersey (bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. i don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. every time he blew one of them away i felt good. this movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? there is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage. but as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measure up. if i lived in that neighborhood, i would get out as fast as i could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. i had to give it a 4. sure there are good "blow 'em away" scenes but that's about it. at that time, bronson was 64. i'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson. bronson takes the place of a schwarzanegger or stallone in this movie. this movie gives you a sense of rejoice. the common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. to sum it up, this is far from being the original death wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.

since paul kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge, the third installment in the "death wish" saga revolves on him returning to new york to visit an old war buddy. he arrives only to find out that brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond attorney, blows away numerous villains with an impressive wildey magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified new yorkers to stand up for themselves. okay, there's no more point in defending the "death wish" series after seeing part three. the 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and, even though it was pure exploitation, part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise. apparently, kersey isn't an architect anymore, he's ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilante actions anymore? all these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that michael winner and charles bronson reduced their "death wish" success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series, with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier, sleazier, meaner and a lot harder to kill. however, the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. i once read a brilliant review that referred to "death wish 3" as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. this description couldn't be more spot-on, as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of gunfire, explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. yi-haaa! this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast, including martin balsam ("psycho", "12 angry men") as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, ed lauter ("family plot", "the longest yard") as the slightly unorthodox copper and even alex winter (from "bill and ted's excellent adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.

the movie is a happy lullaby, was made to make us sleep. and that´s what we do, as we dream about the top beautiful natasha henstridge. no screenplay, no deep characters, nothing special. so, let´s sleep.

director fabio barreto got a strange academy nominea for his last movie o quatrilho. quatrilho is a bad movie, but in bella donna, barreto did one of the worst movies of all time. his adaptation of the novel riacho doce is ridiculous. think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? in the film they do. there isn't a screenplay, it's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with moscovis and henstridge.

the dvd for this film is by alpha video--a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. in alpha's defense, often that is the only print available, but the specialize in public domain and cheap-o films. if you can find another print by a different company, try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. still, compared to most alpha dvds, this one is excellent--especially since the sound is pretty clear (and alpha never seems to include closed captionings--even with films with horrid sound).a man has been dating a lady for a very long time. one night, he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. soon afterwords, he comes clean to his fiancée about this, she forgives him and they marry.very soon after the wedding, he gets a frantic call from the other woman--she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself. when they meet, he learns that she has an std and she wanted him to know that he, too, might now have it. then, although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! the makes a huge mistake. he does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife. some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! at this point, the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people (actually, these were just films of people with stds that they spliced into the film--most of whom have syphilis).in some ways the film is very progressive. it addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges--but only with each other (not bad advice at all). on the other hand, the film never exactly says what it's talking about. they never use the terms std, vd or the like, nor does it even name the diseases. often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other stds--the information just isn't very clear or specific--a very common problem with such films from this era. audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! speaking of "such films", in the 1930s-50s, lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex (though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in hollywood films). many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over-done and the information so inaccurate. the most famous examples are reefer madness and sex madness (both by the same two-bit production company) and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are, this cheap film seems like it should be in the criterion collection!! interestingly, there are weirdos out there (i would definitely be included among them) that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun. this one, however, isn't that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films. while the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 film it's pretty good--despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene. remember kids--just say 'no' to suicide!oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. nowadays, it's a lot more treatable--as are the rest of the stds.

this is the third movie in a month i have watched that did not go the way i expected. the first two being the black dahlia and hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.i have always had a fascination with ufos and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of ufo investigation that was not a comedy. but after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.i could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing ufos, but none here. i am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter, but netflix pushed this movie as a ufo skeptic and a ufo believer investigating multiple sitings.i stopped watching about half way thru. can't believe i wasted that much time with this one. please don't make the same mistake i did.

the only reason i gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out! basically, i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens, any ufo's, anything at all suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie! i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was. this could have been used to the movie's advantage, but i felt, instead, that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me! finally, how big was this cast's wardrobe!? i became so distracted by the number of different, and extremely bright, shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasn't really supposed to be classified under "poor comedy".toe thumbs down!

wow... just... wow. there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own. i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. however, i think there is some other problems here.1. why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? the film acts as though you just can't be a christian and also allow for the possibility? why? they ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e. "the bible doesn't say there is aliens." "well, the bible doesn't say there isn't.), but the actual rebuttal is never answered. the bible really doesn't say there isn't. so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand? or better yet, acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them.2. how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax? what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences? what if it's something else entirely? too bad the film makers already have their minds made up.3. the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult. that's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present. i'm not necessarily arguing that they don't, but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up.4. why does the other reporter (not the greasy haired blonde guy, the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? it's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool.i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena, but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their "faith message" to care much about make a thought provoking movie. as a christian myself, this saddens me.

i happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made christian film about the end times (which i find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). to be fair, i only saw the last 30 minutes, so i missed the part about ufos and the sci-fi stuff. but it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.as a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor. the cinematography and direction were sub-par: no interesting visuals, no layered plot line, no creativity. don't just blame it on the budget- films can still be interesting without special effects. this wasn't. christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. and the message here was hardly "christian."**disclaimer: the rest of this comment is targeted towards christians**first off, it is unethical in any business to bait-and-switch your customers. i don't like being told i can win a free ipod only to realize i have to spend $300 at participating stores first. nonchristians don't like being told they're watching a sci-fi film and then get bombarded with christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. hidden agendas don't win you any friends, much less converts. secondly, you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true. the actors who represented christians came off as callous, smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical "unbeliever"-- they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing. representational dialogue: "turn to jesus- or go to hell!" "fine, don't believe me- but you'll be sorry!" "the day you die, i can guarantee you'll wish you paid more attention to this jesus stuff- when you land in the belly of hell!" ok, i may be exaggerating, but it certainly came off in the same manner. if you think this is a "clear message for christ," you're wrong. i don't recall jesus using threats and coercion. and i don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. so christians, please don't use this as a "witnessing tool" for your "unsaved" friends. it is heavy-handed, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true christian message.thirdly, the theology was bad. apart from characterizing jesus as a means of hell-insurance, it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether ufos or alien life could exist. instead, it offered one pat answer: "ufos are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens," which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most christians. as the bible doesn't mention ufos or aliens, you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. the rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted, sound biblical concept, though nowadays most evangelical christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. if you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting), the idea of two comings of christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. the majority of orthodox christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions.basically, this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of christianity and its beliefs. i wouldn't recommend it.

movies about u.f.o.'s are always a nice way to kill some time, so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick, expecting what can be expected from a direct-to-dvd u.f.o. mystery.boy, was i wrong! at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the u.f.o. theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda. and this is not just a christan movie from an average christian. no, this is christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind. the scary kind.in the end of this movie, the non-believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started (which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non-believers are left behind).when the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, 'just in case we christians are right'. now that's a lamest excuse ever to become a christian if you ask me!this movie still tries to convert non-believers using scare tactics. "believe in god or you will go to hell!" is the message here. simple, but quite offensive, really. especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different.now let's assume you're a christian fundamentalist yourself and you're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie, is this a good movie? i'm afraid it isn't. no actually i'm lying: i'm glad it isn't! the acting is horrible, the pacing is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is laughably bad. as soon as the movie starts, you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected, and you will be right.in the first half hour, it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u.f.o. mystery, but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula look-alike that starts babbling about the devil. at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac, but as it turns out, he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie. as soon as you start realizing this, you know how this is going to end up. but actually it ends up worse.avoid.

my mom and i, rented this movie. i mean, we love those type of sci-fi flicks, whether they be big hollywood flicks or indy flicks.but oh, we were fooled!! two journalists are investigating a ufo abduction in a small city in texas. halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. my mom and i believe in god and jesus and the devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. all i really have to say, is that we are christian, but even we like to have fun. so don't blame christians as a whole, just blame the christians who need to suck the fun out of this movie.in fact you can clearly understand the directors stance on ufo's, and that is that he believes it is all demonic. now, i could say some words, but i will not. all i will say is, that do not watch this movie, unless you feel like being preached. in fact many times it states that we must be perfect in order to enter heaven. well, last time i checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.

im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. i am being honest when i'm saying that this is the worst movie i've ever seen. its just a move about christian propaganda! don't throw away your life, don't see it!i think they made the movie so more people will believe in jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. the actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!i think this movie is a work of the devil. this movie is just not worth seeing, so please take my advice and don't!

this is the worst movie i have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. one comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear? were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts? they certainly did not deserve paying with anything else! this appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half, blending into an equally confused arch christian biblefest in the latter. the entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake, or at the very least crucified!

this movie was a major bait and switch. i rented it because of rebecca st. james, a popular christian singer. i have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a ufo movie. well.......i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. my first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when i witnessed the special effects of the ufo encounters. cheesy! as the movie progressed, i noticed how plastic the actors were. it was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (there are a few exceptions).rebecca was verrryyy disappointing. she is always found in the house and doesn't show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the fold. doesn't she ever leave the house? i had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it. i hope that rebecca doesn't believe the message of this movie - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. jesus spread a message of love and hope. his message inspired others to change out of love, not fear.

after a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i've ever seen. this movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "holy bible".to resume the...ok let's call it a plot... basically alien don't abduct people (that we already know..). no, in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft, or read porno magazine (as one protagonist does).it's complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow christ to be saved.a quote sums it all , imagine a subtle piano music in the background : "you can't let others, even those you love, stop you from following the lord.."and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age...still work to do. boycott this piece of crap

this movie is really bad, there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings: chilean landscape. i know i must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie, but the thing is that it is such a bad movie, that i can only say that is actually bad. michael ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film.

i thought i was going to see a ufo movie. instead, i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept christ in my life, or risk going to hell. the whole ufo thing was one big red herring!!! the acting in it was pretty pathetic. in fact, it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. it wasn't real-life dialog at all. i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn't have wasted my money on it. if, on the other hand, you are into the whole church scene in a big way, and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how limiting) onto other people, then by all means, go see it.

this movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly acted. all of the characters were two-dimensional. it was a real amateur attempt. the movie was fundamentalist christian propaganda. the christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters. the movie was a real "gotcha" for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie. i remember another movie on a similar subject, "the rapture," starring mimi rogers, that was much better and professionally done. i think i'll watch "the rapture" again. if you attend "unidentified" and don't like it, don't say i haven't warned you.

how awful is it? let me count the ways: 1) it is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for christianity. c'mon! if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? it annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) it's not even a good sales pitch! if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, i'd run like hell in the opposite direction. they're scary! 3) the acting is terrible. they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) the cinematography is home-movie bad. wait, actually its not even that good. 5) script bad, bad, bad. all dialogue, no action. like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between the "talking head" close ups. 6) direction... what direction? oh, there must have been a director there somewhere. i challenge you to figure out where.believe it or not, i have some positive comments about this movie. the editing seemed professional, but couldn't make a difference. a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie. the opening theme music was actually very good! very scary and ufo-ish. too bad the movie wasn't about ufos.if you can't tell already, here's the bottom line. i wasted my money seeing this movie, and it made me angry. if they had not disguised what this movie was really about, i could say it was my fault.

one of the worst films i have ever seen! after watching it i walk out like, what happened? i am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. first,i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! this movie isn't scary at all! there is even no typical horror clichés,too. the plot and acting of this movie was terrible. it's not,fantastic,surrealistic or horror,it's just hideously bad turkish feature film.and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. when i watch 'gomeda' i fell into so hopeless,so sad for young turkish movie maker.please,please don't make 'cinema' like this!

he's the only reason to see this film. he gives a very good performance--much better than this crap deserves. he's very handsome and very talented--he deserves better than this. also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this. he's another talented actor who deserves better but, like esai, he gives a very good performance. so, if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch. otherwise, stay away. one more complaint--couldn't we have had more scenes of esai shirtless?

i watched gomeda on movie theater at my city. my friend took away me and i was really curious what would be it looked like. well, i must say this movie was not a horror,may be we can say that is 'fantsastic experimentation'...ok here i go anyway... but there was a lot of shooting,acting,dramatic,theatrical and storytelling problems.i can understand because of director is very young and gomeda is his first feature film.ok directing of this film was not pretty bad,i see.unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.and there is no powerful gothic scenes.as a horror movie it really fails, no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring. some people say 'gomeda' is an art movie, but i could not see a laughable,terrible and breoken off art movie like that.so, how can we say it is an art movie!just funny!

this movie changed my life! hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and i still haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations. and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie, you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film. if you haven't seen this movie, drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy. i guarantee it will blow your mind. and if you don't like it, then i just have one question for you.... watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you!!!!

... in search of the cheesiest "so bad it's good" movie, i've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, only to be left disappointed and bored at the end. not this time!!! my eyes teared up, my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie. sure, hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable, but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this - all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of whoopass, with a bunch of "yeah brother"s and "whatchugonnado"s flying from his infamously goateed mouth. and while the hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the hulkster in the ring, seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick. a laugh riot.

hulk hogan and zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i'll never know why. if not for vince mcmahon's money this stupid film would have never been made. maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. no holds barred is not that movie.

hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend(joan severence) is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler(tiny lister jr.)bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it, and with the evidence portrayed, he should be.

southern cross, written and directed by james becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts. a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's promise, which this film does not. it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past. it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (unexplainedly) follow them. this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other. it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said, "oh great, lets do a shoot out scene there."don't even waste your rental money on this. it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama.

formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (vargas). it looks very much like a tv movie, not really exciting. the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it. no real surprises here, though it is nice to see vargas. great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. the chase scenes are standard fare.

terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from joel and ethan coen. depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! the film meanders along but never builds any momentum. it does get a big boost from clooney's charismatic, gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and t-bone burnett's lively music. otherwise, the screenplay (by the coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****

i am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess. being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it. i finished the movie, and all i can think is the horror!!! i wanted to like it, i really did. i tried very, very hard to like it. but i couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head. the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth. the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end... and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film.i am going to try repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third.do yourself and favor and don't waste your time.

i think my summary says it all. this mtv-ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x (or is that gen y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. example: kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his "wedding." kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. the "joke" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "bits and pieces." problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking "do i look fat?" i recognize the show was not made for me. it was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today. so let them laugh. thank god the show was short-lived.

wow, was this version of the racketeer tough to watch! while none of the other reviews have mentioned this, the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed. the sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. so, you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.while this seriously marred the film, it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. the dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. as one review said, it was like watching a high school play. part of this is understandable, as sound was a new medium, but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. and, like many of these early sound films, the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. and you'd think with a title like "the racketeer" that there would be some action!! however, it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook, robert armstrong, comes to her assistance. when armstrong catches her cheating at cards, he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. the problem is that once the drunk sobers up, he, too, wants lombard and she needs to choose between them. wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! overall, it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw. however, even if you ignore this, the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. and...it was sappy too boot.

carole lombard stars in this transition period film. this film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (first practical sound film was "the jazz singer", 1927). overall, the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic.the viewer may easily note that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the overly pronounced, overly earnest dialog (it seems most likely a diction-elocution-drama coach was employed extensively to teach the "silent" actors to speak lines), creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical.carole lombard's later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures, melodrama, and eager earnestness.mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period, and for it's completely unintended comedy-camp value.

time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. there are of course complications. the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. there are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. its not a bad film, its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. normally i'm forgiving, but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow (then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible). worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong)

"the racketeer" stars carol (deprived of the "e" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (roland drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong (top-billed). it's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines. at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies. "the racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  vidor's "hallelujah!," mamoulian's "applause," wyler's "hell's heroes," capra's "ladies of leisure"  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically. too bad howard higgin wasn't that strong; as it is, watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak, one can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him.

earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece. the adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble.the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.what cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. in a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. they're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. they're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an "odyssey," encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being "stupid." people are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. the movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. comedy? symbolism? no; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.other adaptations of the odyssey are much better. unless you're a george clooney fan, rent something else. but buy the soundtrack cd; the music is great.

although not a big coen brothers fan, i am an admirer of their dark humor films like 'fargo' and 'miller's crossing.' i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is that camp goofy?) unfortunately, 'o brother, where art thou?' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'the big lebowski' or 'the hudsucker proxy.''o brother' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without much point, and not all that much humor or cleverness either. as most reviewers have noted, the film's plot is very loosely  and, as far as i could tell, quite arbitrarily  based on the odyssey. its main character, ulysses everett mcgill (george clooney), is an 'adventurer' like his homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor. of course, we don't discover that this is what the clooney/ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring. and what does homer have to do with "cool hand luke" chain gangs, ku klux klan meetings a la "indiana jones" cult gatherings, a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary, a talent for blue-grass country music singing, an association with baby face nelson, a clark gable lookalike hairdo, and other random and sundry character traits and encounters? i leave that for others to discern.the allusion to preston sturges' 'sullivan's travels' in 'o brother's' title is equally pointless. yes, viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make. and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot/scene riffs (e.g. hopping freight cars, and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie). but so what? the coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art's-sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art. they obviously fall into the former school, but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. is it an homage? if so, why make it? i like post-modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoction.this screenplay is simply a silly mess. the only consistent, and consistently pleasing, element is the folk/country music soundtrack. it doesn't have much to do with homer or preston sturges, but, considering the rest of the film, that's probably a good thing. on the other hand, i'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd.

although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational, still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from andy warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewer-friendly. in any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing joe buck naked (almost all the time!). and the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half-way. this would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler, instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own.

technically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes)and awesomely amateurish, "flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance. a curio, to be sure, but the more polished "trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. i suggest you watch that instead. (*1/2)

i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i'd be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here; the fact that these inherent 'defects' were a direct result of the film's low-budget/underground/experimental nature is, i'd say, beside the point. anyway, for those so inclined, the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro, understandably, became an underground  and gay  icon! the episodic structure showing the day-to-day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes: his meeting with (and eventually posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective 'colleagues' including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers  a bespectacled nerd! perhaps mercifully, the film ran for only 89 minutes against the imdb's claim that its complete length is 105 (but the latter could well be a mistake)! i had watched a few other of warhol's 'movies' and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i've run into yet, bad (1977), and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler (1965) which were mostly a strain to sit through. the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but, as the saying goes, you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two 'chapters' had to follow in quick succession... despite my generally negative reaction to it, flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era, both cinematically and in real life. for the record, an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual candy darling (who appears here rather unremarkably) was immortalized in "candy says", the opening track of the velvet underground's eponymous 1969 album. although the latter band is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their sheerly unique and ground-breaking music, they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own, this is truly a case where i'd much rather experience something aurally instead of visually!

it's hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk, the show couldn't even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in tv history, not since ainsley harriott has had a terrible cooking show host i've watched, at least ainsley harriott has some good moments and some style, this one has no style at all, she's terrible as host, the kitchen looks atrocious, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad, it makes me sick. now i enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style, but this has absolutely none of thatthis is one of the worst tv of the year.

too bad this movie isn't. while "nemesis game" is mildly entertaining, i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie, especially the situations that sara was putting herself into. are we supposed to believe that:1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun, but don't put the whole "i never sinned" riddle together until the very end...and then...and then...get this...she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together?? i know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think we're that stupid?3) when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde, there is not one topless chick in the whole building. nada. c'mon. i know it's canada, but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweed.and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that riddlezone site, that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow, and didn't turn into a little hand (like all cursors do when you click on a hyperlink)?!? i mean, if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie, at least get the little things right. geez.

it seems like if you are going to post here it going to be a 10 star rating ,nobody ever seems to dislike anything ,well i am honest, some don't like that but here we go, rachel ray show is just plain awful.!!!!!!, this show reminds me of the snl character linda whatever if she had a cooking -whatever show.i must say i liked rachel on the food network on $35-$40 a day but i am sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out,give me ham on the street, anthony bourdain , interesting folks,but most of all i find her annoying, she actually told a member of the studio audience to "shut up" yes in a kidding way but shut up is shut up, and who cares about her pet stories, sorry rachel you been cancelled!!!!

here is a rundown of a typical rachael ray show:1. the awful theme song begins to play, and rachael descends wearing her snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator. 2. she begins running around screaming and/or insulting the audience, then yells at them sit down. 3. an awkward monologue.(the next are in any order) 4. a segment tooting rachael's own horn (i.e. "i lost 500 pounds with rach's recipes, "rachael ray saved my life," "rachael's fashion tips.") 5. a totally useless d.i.y. tip (i.e. how to engrave words into casserole dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it.) 6. the unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience (reaction shots of first bites are never shown). 7. a celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience. 8. a person who gets help from one of rachael's cronies (i.e. the i say yes to everything woman, the i own nothing but overalls lady, and the i can't find time to put on makeup housewife). what would they do without you rachael. *gasp*reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. fakeness: rachael ray claims that entire show is unscripted. many people who have attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted. many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. 2. her show jumps around too much: where as oprah, who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show, rachael's jumps around like an adhd soda child on crack. her show averages perhaps 10, short, worthless segments a show. on second you will be getting fashion tips from kojo, and the next rachael will be making gross stuffed "spanish" peppers with manchego cheese, and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage, and the next, well you get the picture.3. rachael is a poor host with bad ideas: aside from her grating personality, rachael's hosting ability is terrible, at best. her questions for her celebrity guests are poor, and often times not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational, or humorous value.in conclusion, you need not waste your time with this schlock. it will be canceled soon anyways.

found this film in a dvd discount rack for $10. it wasn't worth it. some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student. sandra's performance was somewhat credible, but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged.one thing that i will give them, however. unlike most action films, people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.

we also found this movie on the discount rack and made the mistake of purchasing it because sandra bullock was featured on the cover. the cinematography was terrible and the back of the dvd box told more about the plot than the movie itself. oh and i love the uzi cam....not.

my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. but since it featured sandra bullock, who i generally like, i bought it. my disappointment with the film began almost immediately. the dialogues are slow and stiff. the color is distorted. i kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. the acting is amateurish. even the killing scenes are a failure. twice, dead people moved their legs. when my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, i immediately and joyfully complied. this is an amazingly bad movie. tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party.

i don't know how this dvd made its way into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these "3 for £20" deals at a high street store. the thing isn't worth 66p, let alone £6.66! having invested heavily in it, i felt duty-bound to watch it to the end, just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through - and it was.the dialog was awful, the story line was impenetrable (i still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue).in fact there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely sandra bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asap.as a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex-army sidekick while driving. this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! i look forward to the engine-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars!

i watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly i don't think so.what the hell is the story in this movie? i saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.where to start? okay..1) they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill. the entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2) no ricochet. metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.3) magic bullets? in one scene a bad-guy is standing right in front of a good-guy when another good-guy pops out behind the bad-guy and pumps him full of metal. you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist, but the good-guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) after having just splattered a human being all over the wall, the two good-guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft-guns.5) sound? at one point the good-guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm?). the lady screams out "alarm in sector blah blah" and the bad-guy boss says "okay.. this.. is.. not.. a.. drill.. blah blah" in a very, very amateur kinda way. ooh, we're getting ambushed by terrorists, this isn't a drill, but i'm gonna sound like i don't give crap.6) focus!! first you see the bad-guys load up on weapons. for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice. deja vu or loop of scenes? you literally see every single bad-guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way. the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad-guy extra no. xx locks and loads. when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes. boooring!! 7) actors or dummies? one of the presumed good-guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad-guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke-blind or something so they don't see it coming. they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade. then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad-guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't anthrax anyway.8) b flick? i think yeah! a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently. i'd like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and i'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards. extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way. small *pops* and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. though the first bullet hit his heart the good-guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.9) one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip! how stupid can you be!? always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) boring scenes. like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes, the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. cut to the action if you're going for a b flick movie, please.my two cents on this movie.

i saw this one remastered on dvd. it had a big picture of sandra on it and said "starring sandra...." and made it seem like she had a big part in it. not so. she's barely in it. she does what she can with the script, but that's not much. the sound was awful. by that i mean things didn't go together. shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't correspond to the sound. people talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there's no motor noise, road noise, or any other sound. kind of weird.score was awful. it sounded like the same few notes over and over. dialog really awful. acting was awful, i couldn't believe any of it. fight scenes were like a batman comic without the "biff", and "bam". they were really lame. the shooting scenes, i mean with firearms, were laughable, literally. i fast-forwarded through a lot of this movie. even then, it was too long.

i checked this out for free at the library, and i still feel ripped off. yes, sandra bullock is actually in it, but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes, and even those are fairly painful to watch. the rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it. everyone else will just turn it off. don't worry, you aren't going to miss anything. bullock's lines (assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case) are essentially just parroting of other characters lines, like this dialog:lisa (bullock) - "danny, please tell me what is going on."danny - "i don't know." lisa - "whaddaya mean you don't know?" danny - "i don't know - it's something to do with my dad." lisa - "whaddaya mean your dad?" danny - "i don't know - he ****ed up or something." lisa - "why am i here?" danny - "i'm sorry lisa. i don't know." (moments later) danny - "some army buddies of my dad . . . " lisa - "whaddaya mean army buddies?"see what i mean? bottom line - just say no.

the dvd version we bought had sandra bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. you can, however, see how far she has come.the one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in nyc and new jersey in the 1980s.the sound is terrible. sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting. for example, sometimes when they are in the car, the noises from the car are too loud, and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all. the director is fond of close-ups on faces, and then it's clear that the movie has been over-dubbed because the words don't match the lip movements. through most of the movie, the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can.background music, when there is music, is distracting instead of adding to the movie.the direction is laughable. goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially during times when there is supposed to be tension, like in the middle of gun battles. the writing is terrible. there are some subplots that make no sense, and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations. the writer/director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam, but none of it makes sense. these top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving. the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning. it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing.the production values are so bad that at first, we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it. if you like laughing at really poorly done student films, then this movie is for you. otherwise, avoid this movie.

wait until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. anything above 8 would be odd.nice to see the very young sandy bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the new yorker accent but other times her southern (virginia & nc) accent did sneak through. ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.the dvd i rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section that only featured sandra's bio - taken verbatim from imdb. it also had a trivia quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. hope you get them all right!

i walked into blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. so i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter sandra bullock. an action movie with sandra bullock in it and it's rated r!? yay! although i will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'speed' then i was sold. sadly sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: "panicky kidnapped girlfriend" (she is in fifth place on the actors listing for jeebus shakes!) apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie, i figured as much) sandra is the only living human in this movie, everyone else might as well be a zombie in a b-horror flick. this movie deceived me saying sandra was the lead . . . i fell for it like biff from 'back to the future' when marty yells "what's that . . .!!!" god, i wish i watched that instead of this.sandra is the only bright side of this movie, every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling "clear!" to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries. more on sandra later . . . the movie is dull. very dull. think of the dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it is this movie). this movie even somehow makes gun fights and bullet time effects boring, so boring that elephant tranquilizers are put to shame. and this movie's idea of bullet time is a close up of an ak in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away. and i knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding "through-the-action!" the plot? . . . there was a plot? music? . . . even by 80s muck standards is bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake. acting? sandra bullock was good and . . . ummm . . . moving on. is it any good since it is rated r? no, unless r stands for ridicules-snooze-fest.and it is really 80s cliché when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city (rocking guitar licks or power ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. both of which this movie satisfies. at least this movie establishes what era it's from which was unnecessary since sandra's hair was screaming "1980s!!!!" and a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box, which you respond to sadly saying: "that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got." another hammy moment is at the beginning when some-secret-agent-dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die. all that scene needed was the mario death ditty or maybe contra sound effects but nintendo might have sued.and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons. before the big gun scene, da hero is found standing in a boxing ring ('rocky' anyone?), sporting a leather fedora (not 'indiana jones' too) with an ominous spotlights behind him (terminator the 2nd before owning t-1000) what is really really sad is that people on youtube or dailymotion can film better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) then this movie. i'm serious, most rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie. i cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a freaking violation against human rights!) the only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is sandra's career started taking off thanks to this movie. but oh sandra . . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare? the paycheck better been worth it. the dvd also graces you with a little back story on sandra as an extra, seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name. which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs, crafty little critter.i don't have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it. i could bounce back from 'mazes and monsters' with a good old campy bruce willis comedy. but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie. i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i'm amped for them now. for i can't even fathom a movie worse then . . . "gag" . . . 'hangmen' . . .

i give it a 2 - i reserve a 1 rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films. we don't even remember what this movie was about. the only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground, roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting. it was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the 'stunts'. also, when the characters were driving in a truck, the engine noise (or radio? can't recall) would vanish entirely when the actors were talking.and, like others, we bought it because of the sandra bullock front cover. very sad, very bad.

i love sandra bullock-she's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. i realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 walmart rack...you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget. i thought that i'd like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress-but yikes is too kind a word to use...

i absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! i once caught part 5 on vhs 10 years ago, and i was disappointed. but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, i have to say it was no way better than number 5. my expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's pg-13. the acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects. but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore (the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight, but come on..)surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 were directed by sequel-director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface: texas chainsaw massacre iii. i liked puppet master: the legacy, even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies.overall, puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series: a great trilogy but forget the rest..

being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city, ignoring the rest of the country. while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time, i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan! the men interviewed here are the same "a-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s, and here they are again, waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude. the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics, such as race, ageism, the burgeoning gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image, and the rise of the "clones", discrimination of sub-groups within the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). alas, we have none of this presented, and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories. if you were there in that decade, you'll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home-movies of the bars and discos we haunted. if you weren't there, this film will undoubtedly seem dull. it should have been so much more, but sadly, it's not. two stars for jogging my memory...i still miss going to the anvil!

this movie should be retitled: sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea.this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city. i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film.don't get me wrong, the time period looks like a blast. and it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers. but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. technically it's no oscar nominee, but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject.overall, an "eh."

i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. it is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. it's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. with only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. it's more like a "how to" guide for something that can't be done anymore. i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.

formulaic to the max. neither title reflects the serial's actual content, "fighting nazis in morocco," (actually, the iverson ranch). the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. the packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. that's at least three a chapter! aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. when the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too. so, kudos to the fight choreographer, who is the real star of this serial! two positive notes: the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights, and best of all, we have the girl side kick (often a journalist, as she is here) actually participating in the mayhem, mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys. yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in "manhunt of mystery island" (1945). on the negative side, there are just too many jump out of the way escapes-- before the slab falls, before the car goes over the cliff, before the speedboat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you, etc. etc.it is claimed that this serial partially 'inspired' george lucas to make the first indiana jones film, but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development.rod cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he played in all his films. other than watching all the furniture getting smashed, there's nothing really going on here, compared to other serials that have fewer fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters.i give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing.

i have to differ from the other comments posted. amid sporadic funny moments, there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny. the strain shows. i watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation- none of us were thrilled.

is the cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, "falscher bekenner" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum american re-title ("low profile").building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests. it starts out with a grabber, as a haunting shot of a desolate off-the-highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter, who ultimately walks by a totaled car, where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead in a gory mess. stunned, he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine.just out of school, the drifter turns out to be armin steebe, a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition. persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job, he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it, every one with the same fruitless outcome. getting mighty sick of it, his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion: claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit.pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise, he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown. as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter, as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary.if you seem confused about what exactly is going on, don't worry about being the only one: this is about as far and coherent as the story gets. the plot seems simple enough, and perhaps due to it's seemingly direct purposes that's why "falscher bekenner" becomes pointlessly convoluted, becoming enamored with endless false conclusions, dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument (supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland, or something about youth's fascination with crime. hey, it could even be a coming-out movie.) at hand. it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and surrealistically allegorical, but they don't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest. the most fatal flaw, however, is how the filmmakers paint all it's characters in a rough shade of vanilla. there's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal- perhaps too normal- family) catalyze the already under-developed lead character's "plight" never comes into focus. how are we supposed to identify with this young almost-adult's rebellion, with little sense of the world he's living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it? many people drop in and out of the movie (including armin's sort-of girlfriend katja, and a strange, affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies) and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever. they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next.and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality (especially with armin's nightly exploits), it ends with a literal, almost moralizing head-scratcher that seems to halt questions to a "story" that does little but put it's viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion.without any color, it's impossible to shade anything vital in.

a by-the-numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non-allegiance and usage of the term 'blackwater.' the cinematography appears right out of basic cable mow land which removes any semblance of swampy, murky atmosphere from the proceedings. in addition, there's not nearly enough gore, sex or attractive young things to satiate the majority of the film's targeted viewers. that being said, the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive-skinned presence. what else needs to be said about this non-winner? don't rent unless you've got a thing for middle-aged adults bemoaning their past and rants with clichéd priests, shrinks, hispanic stablemen all regretting their past actions.

as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.from the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. the script editor was probably dead and the director should be. to be honest i didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.i have never, and i mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and i watch tons of crap films.turd.

blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle (kristin erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. her parents ely (randy colton) & blanche (leslie fleming-mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. ranch hand & ex-priest miguel (del zamora) recognises isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it. blanche calls priest jacob (cameron daddo) who is her other daughter claire's (madison taylor) ex husband to see isabelle, he confirms miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle & an innocent girl free...directed by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism & i kept asking the same question over & over again, why do i do it. why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? right lets honest about this, blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of the exorcist (1973) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share. there's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things, the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's, the worried parents, the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's, the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different (other than it's total crap) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either, the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out. at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof, there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a 'little prick' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama, or it did in my opinion at least.according to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on 'actual events', yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist... this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. there isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up, there's a scene of a cut arm, there's a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it. there's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive. i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen. one pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it. there is zero scares, no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. there are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. the acting is very poor from all involved, genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent, he is better than this.blackwater valley exorcism is a complete rip-off of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. a total turkey from start to finish.

this movie had very few moments of real drama. after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn't stop laughing. the continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. surely this was a spoof of the exorcist. the collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day mr russo signed up for this one. do i speak latin? et tu brutus.

i have to agree with the previous reviewer. although the kristin erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, i seriously don't think that isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. i also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and i'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not. i'm trying to find the "original" story that it was based on, to compare facts, but i can't seem to find anything about it online.it wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. special effects wise, the movie wasn't bad for a grade b, pretty much, and those possession scenes made it all worth while... that is, if you have nothing better to do. lol

this movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie really sucks! it is disguised as a "thinker's film" in the likes of memento and other jewels like that, but at the end, and even after a few minutes, you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. the whole idea is  i don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one, btw) with stupid "riddles", the kind you learn on elementary school recess, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! what? how, what, why, why? is just like saying that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients, and add water forgot about cooking it? i guess these guys forgot to, not explain, but present the mechanism of why was this happening? you have to do that when you present a story which normal, everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. acting was horrible, with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera, and the guy from highlanders, the series, acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah, they're all real though s-o-b's). the "menacing" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-clever" riddles (enter the 60's series of batman and robin, with guest appearance of the riddle) and the crazies who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smirk on their faces just horrible, horrible.i'm usually very partial about low budget movies, and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve, in lieu of their constrictions, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it.

well i'd probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly i thought it was such a piece of crap i mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was all terrible. although the special effects wasn't a bit bad but i think the should have thought a lot harder than that. i mean how did clara bryant get successfully put into this film i mean she'd do a lot better if she looked a bit further and that goes the same with kristen honey, i mean her character dies and she doesn't bother to try and defend herself i mean it's gotta be a total joke. she should at least do a lot better than what she an do like become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery. but the point is the actors did a complete soulless lousy job and so did the director and the writer who made this film. they should've went into film school to think up some better ideas and i hope everyone agrees with my methods cos they are probably thinking the same thing.

i wasn't able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film. in and age of dv cameras, it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphone.as a filmmaker myself, i know the constraints of indy film-making and, even keeping those things in mind, i'm amazed films can be made this poorly.the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i've seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release. i'm guessing the box is what sold it...it does have good box art, but it all goes downhill from there.side note: it seems the director has 11 friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a "10".

a friend of mine showed me this film yesterday, and i was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible! mix the most awful, clichéd dialog, with the most wooden acting you've ever seen, with the cheesiest special effects know to man, and you get this magnificent beast!'vampire assassins' is funnier than most comedies i've seen, it really is awful! i was in stitches during the scene where the ex cop/vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist. just watch it and you'll see what i mean!i honestly can't believe that someone made this with serious intentions.tragic, but a really good laugh. it has to be seen to be believed.

the forgotten (aka: don't look in the basement) is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie.the story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about.the patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!).now the gore is very poor looking, with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list!.overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch.

i don't normally give movies a "1." although i am a heartless critic, i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile (that is to say, watchable). the main thing i look for is a coherent plot. if it has that alone, i can watch it! let me start by saying, this doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, this is more like an elementary school project...gone horribly wrong! and i've seen every sci-fi movie special that was ever made.many times i've read professional critic reviews that say crap like "this played like a made-for-tv...(etc, etc)" and i kept saying "oh come on, i wish they'd think of a real criticism." well this is worse...much worse! this is truly the worst "thing" i've seen that's lasted the length of a movie (if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time), and i've seen every movie uwe boll made! this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola! :) i'd rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more time...even 5 minutes of it...there was one good scene and it was the end! ;-p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall, now for the serious criticism.the script is poorly written, the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner, the effects are cheesier than those in a power rangers show, and don't even get me started on the screen zoom-in transitions (ugh). someone actually watched this thing, edited it, and then said, "ok release it"? i would have rather burned this than release it! in closing all i can say is "thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and eject feature!" my advice...don't rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you have stop and eject too! :)

so, this is the worst movie you will probably ever see. it's up there with "crossbones" and "southern comfort", but if your a bad movie fan like i am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. why does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? and who is he anyway? why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? what is this? highlander? dracula mccloud? who cares! just laugh at it. this movie has no continuity, no plot, no anything, really. ron hall's range of emotions are always off. he looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. the rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. the special ("short bus" kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed. most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are lit at all. mel novak has the audacity to look off-camera for his line, and it's not even edited out. they just keep on filming. in fact, half of this movie isn't even on film at all. it's 1/2 film, 1/2 sony hand-cam. for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home. this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes, it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain! but oh do i love it! thank you ron hall, for this cinematic abomination. i went out and bought it, cause it's just so damn funny. ($1.99 on amazon, and i had it rush delivered!)"i have weapons! i have weapons! i have weapons!"

if you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.i feel for you, i *really* do. and i profusely apologize as a canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.i, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b-movie ripoff of blade. i thought, "sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie." i'll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their 'creation': thanks for removing the rec xx/xx/xx from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie.and for the record, i *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, i swear to god.you know what? i'm not writing anymore about this. it's just too painful.

ok, normally i am fascinated by z movies. some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. in those movies have a shred of talent. they want to get that talent out so unfortunately for them, they have to associate with crappy people to make their films. but some z films do have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them.not here.as soon as i saw it i thought...'wow, a blade knock-off.' believe me, if this movie could have lived up to that label that would have made it a better movie.instead i was subjected to some of the most horrible acting i have ever seen in my life. master kao was bad, so bad that i believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to comprehend his acting. i am still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he would raise his voice in speaking certain words...to add dramatic effect i'm sure...but it was for no apparent reason. simply mind boggling.oh and then there is the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie. purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds, but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting.the main hero and the main villain did decent jobs. the main hero (derek washington) seemed like he actually knew martial arts.

this movie was pathetically awful. the sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. if you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. this movie totally rips off blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy i should say).i don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. i actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes i do. they are laughing almost non-stop at the stupid action, dialogue and acting.

this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one i've ever seen. it wasn't even a bad b movie...i would have rated it at as a z. the special effects were ridiculous...err if you could even call them special effects. i think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head...it was the box that sold the movie, while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing (which both is why i rented it) it was a waste of not only time but money as well. i didn't last long. i took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie i believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had soooo many complaints about this horrible movie. my 6 year old could have done a better job filming it/writing the script!

i hope the people who made this movies read these comments. the choreography was horrid, the plot was nill, and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk.the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move. camera cut-aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects. the lightning was just plain stupid. the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen.next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics, better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts.honestly there are shows on t.v. that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one.stick to martial arts (unless its as poor as your acting) then take up quilting.

as i said, sometimes low budget is good. you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra bs that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. well...this was that piece of crap. if anything, i thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. the only half-witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). there was never a bill smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. even gerald okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies. the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their $%#@#$. the sound was horrible, as if all sound was recorded on the set. my 10 year old could have written a better script...btw, my 10 year old fell asleep...no kidding. i give a b+ to editing for cutting the movie to only 90 minutes...60 minutes would have been an a+.

do not avoid this movie. simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire. you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to. so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh histerically then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind. don't expect a good movie, expect the worst... and it will be even worse than that. i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection. right next to anchorman.

this is your typical junk comedy.there are almost no laughs. no genuine moments. no memorable lines. no scenes where you think to yourself, "that was clever". nothing. the plot is embarrassingly bad. it's ugly to look at and boring as hell! there is no substance here. this movie has nothing. it doesn't matter if farely was in this or not. a crap movie is a crap movie no matter who's involved. also, david spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie/tv show that he's in.this movie was dead on arrival. there is no life here. no fun. no intelligence. there are plenty of other "dumb" comedies more enjoyable that this one. this film is just pathetic. 2/10

*** possable spoiler but probably not ***the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in itanymore! diddy is gone aswell!the 1st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favoritesuper nintendo games. (the other being super mario world)the 2nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels,although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times.however this one is the worst of the lot! it does not have the feel ofthe original or 2nd, the enemy's look stupid and the levels areeven worse. it does not look realistic anymore! i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two, the first had greatbackground music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in thisgame is horrible!it happens a lot these days that movies, shows and sometimesvideo games that start out fantastic, end up with it being ruined bya stupid sequel! i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as goodnow that it has donkey kong 3!they should have left it at the original or maybe the 2nd one.

sorry to disagree with you, but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging. so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games. this is, mind you, almost ten years after the initial release of dkc 1. the graphics were ground-breaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. the music and characters are all memorable, and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. true, the second game was better than the first, and the third was perhaps lacking the 'edge' of the second installment. but all three offered different play, and i enjoy them to this day. by the way, i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever (and tvs were black and white!).

(warning: some spoilers ahead.)what an incredibly crappy movie. it makes iron eagle 2 seem good.the story is as follows: captain holiday (rutger hauer) gets shot down by his friend banning (robert patrick) to stop him from shooting down a iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians. six years later holiday returns to take his revenge. among other things he, sitting in a tank, chases banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife over a field. he manages to fire shells and drive the tank at the same time. after getting the tank blown up by a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet. with it he shoots down a number of allied fighters before attacking the nato headquarters in an attempt to kill banning's wife.an extra bonus is that major baxter (who holiday hangs in her office) has put the rank insignia on her right shoulder on backwards. elegant.

well, you know... rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors. but wtf with this movie? the story was lame and the script was just terrible. the poor actors didn't have material to work with!the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick. you would expect something like top gun... huge disappointment! the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke. the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources, not made for this movie. and they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models, taking for granted the audience will not notice it.as i said the story was lame. with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting. in short, it seems a b-movie made in the 70's.i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here. they sure must be ashamed.

this one is a poor attempt at spinning the old "cons turn good" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. it actually reminded me of the american series 'the players', although nowhere near as good. omar epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in terminator 4.the mod squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy. at times it takes itself serious but other times it tries to be humorous but fails miserably. the film has a kind of half-finished feel about - as if it was stretched to the 90 minute mark.you'l be disappointed.

well, this movie shows us that mark griffiths and producers think we all are idiots. if not how should we understand this:american pilots take off on mig-29s. suddenly all aircrafts turn to f-16s. ha, a magic! after an action... migs land. the magic again!oh, did i mention that f-16s had israel markings? another magic: obviously unarmed l-39 trainers are bombing enemies.and more magic: while all movie is situated in europe, we can see a desert in almost any flying scene.maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs.ok, ok, this is a movie. i should write about its story... wait. a story? yes there is some story in this film. and its horrible as well.

this is one of the most boring films i've ever seen. the three main cast members just didn't seem to click well. giovanni ribisi's character was quite annoying. for some reason, he seems to like repeating what he says. if he was the "rain man", it would've been fine, but he's not.3 out of 10.

my caddy limo was destroyed!!! well, i had one just like it - drove the hoi polloi and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years. that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you. lordy, what a bomb - as in rpg go boom. i also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick. robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. unfortunately, rutger hauer played his part like a red-nosed circus clown. if he couldn't take it serious why should his audience? the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming.the dialog was written by 10 yr old's for 8 yrs old's. surprised there wasn't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets. oh well, i am a movie fanatic - ergo - you must take the bad to get to the good.

this movie is astonishingly poor. it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue, waiting for leslie nielsen to appear. it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie, and worse still - other people funded it and gave it the green light.rutger hauer obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up, either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay.strangely, this film is so poor, that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it actually got funded, and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it. the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful, with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas intruments "speak & spell".the hollywood money machine at it's worst. funny though.

it's as if the stay-puffed marshmallow man from ghostbusters had been reincarnated in rutger hauer's body and is taking revenge upon a rival's pregnant wife! if seeing an obese hauer chase a very pregnant isabel glaser (imagine the spine-tingling thrills in that contest) sounds good to you, see this film! seriously, if hauer is what an iraqi pow looks like after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in baghdad. overall "tactical assault" rates 2 stars instead of 1 because mike mitchell as hawk is terrific. mitchell burns up the screen as a nato pilot until his plane is burned up itself (by an enemy missle), whereupon the film loses what little verve it had to begin with.

... said the continuity announcer as tactical assault was about to be broadcast . after seeing the first two minutes i started thinking rutger might want to get a new agent . after seeing the next ten minutes i started thinking rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances yup this is a truly terrible movie . i wasn't expecting much and why should i if the name rutget hauer appeared in the credits , but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured nato warplanes with ussr markings bombing bosnia i realised i was going to be force fed inedible turkey three months after christmas .the attention to detail is non existent . nato planes carry ussr markings then were told hauer's character spent six years in an iraqi prison which would make the setting 1997 . what nato were bombing the serbs in 1997 ! i guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but i know i did . the producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with iraqi jets that suddenly turned from migs to f-4 phantoms then back again but i did . even stranger characters would take off in f-16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a soviet built mig oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a basic instinct revenge plot . i'll give the producers some credit ( maybe credit is too strong a word ) because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell , policemen from hell , flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps tatical assualt being the worst movie of the lot

this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical release,though it feels like a direct to video movie.it's ok,i guess,but nothing special.the acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this point.and like the third movie,there isn't much in the way of imagination.also,the sentence "directed by alan smithee" is never a good thing.smithee is the pseudonym directors use when they want nothing to do with the movie.anyway,its an acceptable movie in the hellraiser series,but not much more than that.it's a slight drop in quality from number three,and a huge drop from the first two.for me,hellraiser iv:bloodline is a 4.5/10

there is nothing original,humane or insightful in this film. the acting is average, images are amateurish, the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic...something close to a soap.in 2:37,a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama. we watch, partly, because we want to know who dies. the various characters each have a problem, and the film shows how bad each problem is for them, but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves. despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events, there is never another way of seeing the events themselves. so in 2:37, the arseholes are arseholes, the angels are angels. this is simple stuff.without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence. you hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts, bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.in the end, if you know anything about film in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature rip off of elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about gus van sant or elephant. the positive posts on imdb curiously avoid any mention of this, or simply don't value originality. if you do want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation. i was surprised by the filmmakers age when i found out after seeing this film - i had assumed a 13 year old had made it. the twenty somethings i've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man.

***spoilers!*** i sometimes wonder what makes sequel-makers think that they have to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind iconic horror films. the original "hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. the 1988 sequel "hellbound" was also a fantastic horror film, though i personally didn't like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites, some of the all-time creepiest horror-villains in the original. the third part, "hell on earth" (1992) was already quite a mess, whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead-cenobite pinhead (a typical 90s stupidity) and therefore destroyed most of his scariness. this fourth part "hellraiser: bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third one, but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary 'background information' about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell.seriously - did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made? i think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. the setting of "bloodline" goes back and forth in three different periods. the film begins in a 22nd century space-station, when scientist dr. merchant (bruce ramsay) attempts to close the gates to hell forever. when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons. in 18th century paris, merchant's ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. an evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful angelique (valentina vargas). since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages... the film, which takes place in the 18th century, the present, and the 22nd century, really is quite a mess. i admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but its also its smallest part. the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak, and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. the film's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make-up and gore-effects, the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the she-demon, and pinhead (doug bradley), who, in spite of having lost some of his creepiness, still is a menacing villain. it is an almost offensive idea for "hellraiser" fans, however, that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light-show. overall, "bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly. even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it, as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee. overall, this is only recommendable to hardcore pinhead-fanatics, and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon's creepiness. all others are well-advised to stick with the brilliant first, and excellent second part of the "hellraiser" franchise and skip all the others. the makeup effects in "bloodline" are creepy as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. my rating: 3.5/10

it's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. but even by that low standard this is a terrible film.essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. an ambitious idea. but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. unless you're an "alan smithee" fan, avoid this one.

hellraiser: bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the hellraiser series well and truly sets in. gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies. gone is the ethos of pinhead and his minions. gone are the sick desires of humans. in fact everything that once made hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture.all that is left is that basic premise of christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons. what happened to the evil that men do? this watered down excuse for a hellraiser movie is padded out with endless psycho babble, so that pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be. the film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed. pinhead is not alien. the link between the box and the 'demons' or 'hell' is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard.the lead female character is called 'rimmer' and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name. really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name.shame on you kevin yagher and alan smithee.

this film is so copy-cat, cliché-ridden, clumsy, and laboured, i find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. here is the range of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologising, and simply unfeasible storytelling in this "hard hitting" representation of high school: the tough guy jock is really a homosexual. the a-student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest. a teacher is mean to a student who wets his pants in class. a girl who is going out with the above-mentioned jock is really in love with him and "just wants a family".maybe the only saving grace is the student counsellor scenes which are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that it beggars belief. this film shows me no insight into teenagers and i will not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers, and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with "understanding" teen issues. i mean, what is the moral of this film? "hey guys, let's all look out for each other and hug each other" give me a break. anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back. in the 1980s we were watching kentucky fried movie, xtro, porky's, evil dead, terminator, etc. this film will fall on deaf ears. 2:37 is right up there with another australian "indepedent" film, 'one perfect day,' which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film. thank god no taxpayers money was spent on this boloney.avoid!!!!

i truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it.sure, i'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture.1987's "river's edge" is an excellent example of a well-made teen drama. however, what i take exception to is the infantile, grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of "2:37" took.a prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them.my other major problem with this film, apart from its complete plagiarism of gus van sant's "elephant" (surprised van sant didn't sue) is its 'bull loose in a china shop' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide.in short, avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently. i've heard that his motivation for making "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. having seen the substandard result, this doesn't surprise me in the slightest. this is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on dvd. pure and simple.

the time i wasted seeing this movie, i demand back! i felt sick afterward, but not because it touched me in any way. it's pretentious, trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved, but i couldn't care less. the characters are soulless and stupid. you don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn't leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation. all of the students in the movie has issues, but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems.if i could write better in english i'd never stop. but i can't, so, i'll stop now.don't watch this.

this movie made me think....of how i could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors, who, as an australian, i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.but the movie itself? let me tell you a story....found this dvd in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here, so i thought i would give it a go.for some reason, i decided to watch the 'special features' before i watched the actual movie, not something that i usually do. turned the 'making of' off halfway through, as i'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude.the movie? ugh. full of clichés and pathetic character development. the actors? well done guys, you are aussies and i applaud you. and, just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them, you unfortunately did not have a great script to work with.i felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. i have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. agreed.finally (and forgive me if i don't phrase this correctly), i was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes we know that things such as incest do occur, but i really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. i believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there somewhere. otherwise, the movie is all about them and their feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience.which i think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. the special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting, the day after he himself tried to end his own life. well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however the movie reeks of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. "i feel horrid, i'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid". (note: i have read the interview with andrew urban, and understand why thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues, but i believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed - the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs, and i feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here)by his own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and sadly, this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.as for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch it - not sure there either. because there is a very dangerous line at the end. i too have been in a place where i have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky', but as an adult, i do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. might be in there to promote discussion, but again, it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. in fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.i haven't seen elephant, but i just might go find it, given all the comparisons here.nothing personal here guys, i do hope you can make another movie someday, and we all have to start out somewhere, so forgive me if i've been too harsh. i am glad that you are proud of what you created, which in the end is what life is all about. it's not a movie i would recommend though.oh, i did like the way the time-frames often collided, thought that was an interesting way to film. but the whole "its the quiet ones you have to watch" - we already know that.

i'm sure some people will enjoy it, and find it powerful, or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story, but from an unbiased stand point, it's not very well done. the film revolves around atypical angst-ridden teenagers, each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it's like to be a teenager. we get to see a bit of each teenager's lifestyle, but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me, whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind, or the black and white "interviews" with the students, there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie, and nothing i needed to see. yes, it deals with some strong subject material, and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well, but the entire project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems almost an exact replica to van sant's "elephant" (one dealing with suicide, the other with a school shooting). as i said, some people will probably enjoy this, and the director/writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one, so it's nice the movie was made with some heart in it, but i feel it's incredibly ineffective, and when dealing with material that can be so easily clichéd to do something original with it. i would not recommend this movie.

it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking (quoting some of the comments). murali k. thalluri must have thought by himself: "oh, great! elephant ... what a fantastic movie! i'll try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices!", sadly enough, he even failed with his outrageous idea. the movie turns out a complete failure. considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van sants "elephant", it makes it look even more ridiculous - a most embarrassing faux pas for a film director.the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom. this scene, already, shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene. you don't buy a single word they say. in carries on, interrupted by short interview-styled bits of the kids who "live on their marry lives" with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue. thalluri means to introduce the characters this way, to give a kind of fast-as-junk-food insight look into their hearts ... and fails once again. not five minutes later, thalluri ultimately screams at the audience "yes, people! i stole this movie and for some curious reason, i am proud of it!" by taking gus van sants most unmistakable narrative style from "elephant": he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation. hm, doesn't this seem awfully familiar? to me, this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which i couldn't stand this dreadful movie any more. shame on you, murali k. thalluri, i say! i am especially surprised that "2:37" has reached the official selections in cannes as of 2006, whereas everyone must have certainly remembered "elephant" (2003) at the very same film festival just a few years ago! so, how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful rip-off end up being shown there? i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake.directors like thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who aren't (and cannot completely be) aware of every independent film out there. as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (although it is without a doubt a masterpiece), few people notice that the story as told in "2:37" had been told before! how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes, i cannot say. it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it.2:37 is by all means solely commercial, worthless as an independent film and (on a certain level) rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol, "elephant".

i don't understand what is hard hitting about this movie! i don't understand why high school kids should watch this! i don't understand why this should have made me think about anything in the slightest!*spoiler*when the un-noticed girl is on her way to commit suicide, was i the only person cheering her on? the cliché'd classical music, long tracking shots, melancholy emotion of the film by that stage had me in reversal to what was intended. i would have only been happy if she walked into the room and the entire cast was in there with her holding scissors to slit their wrists up. why?cause i went to high school.... and frankly im sick to death of seeing movie after movie in australia with teenagers in it being solely based on terrible clichés. i've been waiting ages for a younger person to write a movie that im able to relate to and this stereotype driven piece of emo garbage is what i got instead. it was like a dark version of heartbreak high that needed a predictable ending. why are all teenagers in aussie dramas depressed or have really weird problems that just aren't plausibly told? on the plus side, this was funnier then 'blurred'. and i needed a good laugh.

honestly, mr. thalluri.... if you do a drama movie in a high-school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the time-frame and jump back and forth... if you do that, you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of "elephant" which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles. you just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating.where "elephant" (which was released 3 years prior to this movie) uses school shootings (or to be exact the columbine shooting) as the focal point for its script 2:37 uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked. its the same slow story telling, a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning. at least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. so you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stoner/skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't deal with his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive. you also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of "2 urethra syndrome" who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so every day! wow, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard. he gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. thats new-age realism directly leading to "the twist" and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim...after watching the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day including, incest-rape, teen pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before, kind of like your "very realistic" daily soap... trying hard to be) we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him (in a thoughtful piano playing sequence btw, seen that somewhere before??). and it gets even better... before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of "yes" and "no" she asks 2-urethra-guy if he is ok, constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. now you got a movie that is a total rip-off of elephant, fails with some really sloppy story telling (the whole rape-incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way) and people call this a shocker.what the heck is going on?? is all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here?? i think elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip-off failing on many more levels. i have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life... and believe me i watched a hundred of horror movies so i know how low you can go there. this is a total let down in all departments... its nor realistic, its stolen, its damn slow and by all means i wonder whats more useless... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch romeo+juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and more realistic way) or this ridiculous set up... come on! i am still trying to work out if 2-urethra-guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.

i couldn't relate to this film. i'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic'. how many people at your school were victim to incest? how many closet homosexual jocks were there? how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? hmmm. ok you wouldn't know even if their were. but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. but hey, where's the 'entertainment' in that?with regards to the girl who committed suicide - i found this to be exploitative. i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. i didn't buy it as a real life scenario.and the problems of the other students i didn't fully relate to. bullying is explored but that's been done to death, we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. closet homosexuality? pfft, another cliché gets rolled out. thats the thing really, too many clichés. i guessed the ending at the start. there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. you've got all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. and i thought, what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? and surely enough..one thing i will say, and it is the saving grace of the film, is that it does not glamourise suicide. the suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch. it is a powerful scene (regardless of how contrived it is)and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at cannes???

i caught 2:37 at the afi fest in los angeles. it's a very well shot first film (though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes), and i'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the "dark side" of high school - in other words every side of high school. but the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the premise's promise. there are several characters, but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be. there's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "i am troubled teen x, i have y problem." the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome.let's start with the men. you have the stoner kid who's gay, the jock who's also gay, the boy who rapes his sister, and mr. peepants. as the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves. naturally (or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes), the two gay male characters beat up women, peepants, and themselves. i'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads, or if the characters somehow transcended them. yet neither took place, and that's all there is to these characters' stories.next, the ladies. one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapee of the sister-raping brother, and there's the girl who kills herself (i'll get to that later). again, i don't think there's a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers (i'd be out of a job were that the case), but i do think that it's only justified if there's more to that character or story. if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than "i'm a teenager and life sucks," i'd be happy as a clam. but nothing new is revealed! nothing is subverted, or changed, or sublimated.finally, the girl who kills herself. this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling. we're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film? we've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story? it's cheap, exploitative, and sloppy. despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this, you have to earn something like that. you can't simply purchase it on credit. so this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down, and the film ends. what have i learned? i already knew high school sucked - been there, done that. i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. i already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked.what else is there, then? smoke, mirrors, and some really nice views of leaves. oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina i've seen in a while.

this film did well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce, the gazebo. frankly, i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy. both lead characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. a veteran supporting cast including fred clark, harry morgan, and eva gabor lend excellent support. and, the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush. and, there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter.i cannot recommend it started with a kiss.

back in college i studied marketing and, even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention, i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing, namely: it's not what you sell; it's how you sell it! this principle fully applies to "the devil's triangle", as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package. writer/director richard winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention away from the major inaccuracies, so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere, like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king crimson. and i'm guessing richard winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, as there was a huge bermuda triangle hype going on during the mid-70's and literally every movie production  whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick  covering the topic earned big money at the box office. "the devil's triangle" overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant, but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating stark voice of the almighty vincent price generates an ambiance of fright and creepiness. the narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of "strange occurrences" and "mysterious vanishings" of ships and airplanes in the bermuda triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century, but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent mr. price invariably ends every chapter with the sinister words " just another unsolved mystery of the devil's triangle". after a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic, but i guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974. the documentary expands a little more on the most notorious bermuda triangle mysteries, like the five planes of military flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the vessel uss cyclops, but still even in these chapters only a minimum of serviceable information is given. the cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the supposedly real-life witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes. if you're looking for an informative and objective documentary on the bermuda triangle, i certainly wouldn't recommend this movie, but in case you want to sit back and listen to vincent price's hypnotizing voice for nearly a full hour, this is your chance!

this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet pimpernel ever to be devised. as a pimpernel fan, i was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.percy blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. marguerite never had an affair with chauvelin, nor armand with minette, whoever the heck she is. chauvelin would not randomly shoot tony in the head. chauvelin's name is not, nor has it ever been, paul. they have completely eradicated any reference to the pimpernel's disguises, replacing them instead with james bond-esque gadgets and gizmos.as to the film itself... the makeup is horrifying. the women look like clowns. elizabeth mcgovern's beauty mark wanders around her face at random. the poor, pitiable actors have no script to work with, so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. the dialogue... oh, the dialogue. the dialogue is unbearable. and whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance. (i counted 13 location captions in the first half-hour before i gave up. as if we can't figure out that the body of water between england and france is the english channel.)the film--if i can bring myself to call it that, since it's really just videotape with a filter--is absolutely without redeeming value. do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivel--instead, go watch the 1982 anthony andrews/jane seymour version, or the 1934 leslie howard film, or indeed anything but this one.

as someone who has read all of baroness orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, i must say that the 1980's version, with anthony andrews and jane seymour, was better than this. it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. this new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. nice costumes, though.

yawn, that is my reaction to this film. i was really hoping this would have been a good modern day slasher but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers. instead, it tries to be something it isn't, which is a psychological thriller, and it fails so miserably at this. even the title "freak" suggests that this might be interesting. match this with the cover art on the dvd and you think "ok, maybe i will give this one a try". not worth the time.the story actually starts up a bit interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head being chained up by his fat mother. she yells at him and probably beats him since in one scene we see her actually slap him for no reason. after all this, he decides he has had enough and smashes her face in with (i believe) a rock. present day, he is now in insane asylum and is being transfered. on his way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes. introduce also the 2 leads characters, a little girl and her older sister. they are moving and hit the road. so most of the movie is them riding around in the car talking amongst themselves. but, the bandaged "freak" is now on the loose and is about go on a rampage of grueling murder! (this is me being totally sarcastic)i can't believe how boring this movie turned out to be. the budget was on the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialog i could just care less about. this is one of those movie where the packaging is better then the flick itself. and to compare this to halloween?! rubbish! i am not even a fan of the the halloween series (except the 3rd one) but halloween is far superior than this. at least with halloween we have a great score and some genuinely creepy moments. with this, there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing creepy about this movie. maybe this movie would have fared better if it had a solid score because even the worst of movies are tolerable if the music is good.well, that is just my opinion on the movie. i thought it was just a complete waist of time and money. but, since the movie has over a 4/10 rating on imdb, there must be people that like this movie. i am not one of those people. 2/10

i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking, the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting, but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring.

if you are home on a weekend, very bored and lack the will to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie. the acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad, which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this. this is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex. or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - that 'rock' band brian austin green is in is really terrible, i think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents.

sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. this is one of those films. of course i can't help that i'm biased. i'm from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i don't find billy crystal funny at all. and i can't stand all that english style photography(tony scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. i suppose we're supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey. oh and the plot. if you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, since they're more dangerous. and of course there's the cliché of the cops on the verge of retiring. but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson center(a state building!) of course it's a cool building, but it's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house.

in case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's samuel l. jackson-eugene levy clunker the man. this 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly billy crystal and the late ethiopian shim-shammer gregory hines together as some witty chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. that's pretty much the extent of the movie. interest is somewhat peaked by hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to will smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like memento's joe pantoliano and "nypd blue's" jimmy smits. my favorite scene is, i dunno, the car chase on the tracks, i guess. basically, i just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks. well, this and lethal weapon 4... and rush hour 2... and the man...

this movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. i felt as if i was watching a car accident--sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head. the plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. although, it did fit the tone of the movie, i was hoping for something to improve this movie. i still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much. it's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful, awful, story. there's not much more to say about this movie. save yourself the time and watch c-span. it'll be more uplifting.

this story is about a safari in africa that meets some guy named trent--who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes. naturally, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men. the rest is pretty predictable.this movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about africa--the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage, film of animals that are not native to the continent (such as orangutans, moose, coatamundis and ground hogs),a white actor in dark makeup playing a native, bad acting (particularly from trent--a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounding like chico marx), a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female tarzans. by the look of it, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $49.95--including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit! but, what i didn't expect was an imdb score of 4.9. this is poor, but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high! now i am not saying the film isn't worth seeing--it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends. just don't expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film.finally, here's a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic:"oolama like strong white man. oolama want strong white man...""oonga-bunga" "me-te-tonga....no,....keeel ('kill') man"

the plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the african jungle/ plains.its a turkey and the some. what it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. there are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive i think so). this is a movie to sit and make fun of- but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. at any other time this is going to be a chore to get through. its a bad bad bad movie. beyond that i'm speechless

abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre. lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog. and it's awfully talky for a movie about people who don't speak english. there's no adventure to be found here; it's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback.three pale-face dopes wander the african wilderness and encounter warring man-hungry tribes of amazons. these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to invent makeup, shoes, and underarm hair removal technology. despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd," the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones.the only thing of interest, as if there were any question, is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951. plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves. no nudity or appreciable violence. on the other hand, you may be humming the catchy native song for days.

the camals are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934. i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. it certainly isn't.it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. it is quite silly in parts. depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.the cast is lead by jack hulbert with anna lee as the love interest.one viewing is enough for this movie. overall, a disappointment.rating: 2 stars out of 5.

i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version. i rather enjoyed it. either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. sure it moved a bit slow at times. i liked it.as far as mst3k goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. take soultaker for example.joe estevez and robert z'dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly i couldn't help but laugh. i couldn't take them seriously. it really created a unique feeling though.vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script. a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today. her role was played well. not too screamy not to masculine but just right. the camera really likes her in this movie. i would have casted her in that role after ready the script.anyways, this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given. please watch the uncut version if you see the mst3k. it deserves that much.

first of all, since i'm one of the people who never saw the mst3k chopped up version of this movie, i can't comment on that.however, i did see the original version of this movie on the sci-fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel. in fact, i thought it was one of their better offerings.i've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about soultaker with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so. in it's original cut, most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi pic.in contrast to the above, i've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature, dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand, are the same ones who can't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on mst3k. or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mst3k viewing to begin with.

take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. to be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. so sorry. i really tried to like it. there didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we've got to find a way out of here. didn't learn too much about any of the characters so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. this isn't the worst movie in the world. "open water" holds that title for now.

it takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic stephen king-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. about half-an-hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or so i naively thought). the mutt fails to look all that fearsome, which leonard maltin, the notoriously clueless/hopeless and always grinning film critic, would disagree with: he considers cujo to be "genuinely frightening". (i often do have to wonder if maltin is genuinely thick - or merely likes to do favors for his hollywood friends...) it's both illogical and inconsistent the way wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury. and, naturally, her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror-film clichés; trust king to use it to minimum effect. the premise is imbecilic, too banal, even for a horror film: a rabid mutt attacks a family. is that it? this sort of thing barely constitutes a 3-minute sub-sub-plot in your average zombie film. i think even cujo must have sensed that he was starring in a turkey. mutts have terrible agents... but what i really don't understand is how people can actually throw themselves at the "cujo" book and read it from cover to cover? these sk fans must be immortal: that's the only explanation, i.e. why they treat time as such a meaningless commodity.bodycount: 3.

cujo is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by stephen king.i've never read the novel but just scanning the comments page has given me some insight. i noticed a reference to the change in the ending.the plot of the movie is as follows - a st. bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree.the plot sounds quite worn now, having been done in various movies. however it might have been something new when king wrote the novel. or perhaps king's novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie.anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten. nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. i found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the tv, "come on, get started!". the events that i was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a tv movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a tv soap opera. unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level. the dog was the best character in the movie, but it didn't get enough screen time in this section. there was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later.after the 40 minute mark point, something finally happened. the dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. it began attacking some people. there was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. even in this overly long second half, the suspense would build up well before dying again. it was just a stop-go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion.without giving the ending away, i can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a stephen king story.the suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch. some great camera angles add menace to the dog's vicious nature when he attacks people. this is particularly important because as others have mentioned a st. bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as, say, a rottweiler. unfortunately, the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen. the music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful. this may fit a tv movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer.this brings me on to a wider problem with this movie - the photography. the camera-work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap tv movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on channel 5 here in the uk where i am writing this comment from.the top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie's dull segments. dee wallace and danny pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given. i could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. i won't pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do.as someone who is a fan of salem's lot and stephen king's it, both movie adaptations of famous stephen king novels, i had high expectations for this movie. but it turned out to be a massive disappointment.overall, i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch cujo. this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie. hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do.

i am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes. i feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately i know exactly how this film is going to end.the premise is simple enough, rabid dog on the loose in a small town, kills people. great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror.uhh ..no.the main problem is this is based on a book (stephen king) and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. why? cuz its boring! the first 45 minutes tries to build depth to its main characters and create suspense. it however lasts too long (half the film!) - the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway, and it just about creates zero suspense. the easiest film (according to plot and time) to compare this to it the classic jaws. everything that jaws does right, cujo does wrong. jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread. cujo does neither. jaws effectively creates a scary, creepy villain in its shark. cujo has a dirty st bernard running about growling and jumping, and not a lot else. jaws is exciting and unpredictable. cujo is a tireless bore that remains predictable right to the end.also confusing is the plethora of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot.if this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good. but it wasn't. it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life.people on here are saying this is one of the best king adaptations - im sorry you could not be more wrong. the mist is a hundred times better, thinner is 10 times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good! this in my opinion is one of the worst! the only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real, even though they were dull.films ended now, and it didn't get any better. avoid.

why, oh why, is this trash considered a classic? i've seen higher body counts on episodes of the simpsons. virtually nothing happens in this film and much of it's running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a low-rent soap opera.the trenton family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed. but when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad. the rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering st. bernard circles them over and over.regarding the kid, i have never, ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life. and obviously he's completely aryan since blonde-haired and blue-eyed kids, such as the one prominently featured on packets of kinder chocolate, are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair, like me. all he does is cry and whine. same goes for mommy. she gets out the car, she gets in the car, she gets out the car, she gets in the car.i know this was made in 1983 but i just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid, illogical decisions. if mommy just used some common sense she'd be able to get away from the icky dog.it's very poorly written and there's zero tension. if you want to see a good "bad dog" movie then check out john lafia's man's best friend. it's funny, inventive, has a better dog, a higher body count and a more involving story. leave this garbage be.

although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. examples like his new job and shanghaied come to mind, and i would also the floorwalker in this category.charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.there aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator. for the rest, quite disappointing.4/10.

this movie was extremely boring. i only laughed a few times. i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner's name on the cover. it's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. she takes him to a club called the playground, where he befriends several pimps. when mayor tony gold (shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, lil' pimp must lay down for his homies.the animation isn't very good in this. it looks like it was made with macromedia, which i'm sure it was. it doesn't suck, it's just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years. the humor in this is not very good, i didn't think any of it was funny.

first things first, i am by no means a picky movie watcher. i'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize, i, like most other people, watch to be entertained. i'll basically watch any type of movie of, no matter how bad anyone says it is (sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of). with all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. i saw it on tv and just didn't know what i was watching. it was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie, and had way too much sex, innuendo and swearing to be a kid's movie, in fact, i doubt even kids would be amused by it. the humor (pretty generous even calling it that) was so pretentious and campy, i couldn't see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny. the only thing that made me laugh was how people like bernie mac and ludicrous could put their name and time onto/into something so hurting. luda's character was such a cheap ploy for laughs, which fell extremely short of its goal. the plot didn't make any sense whatsoever, the storyline has got to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on screen. i could keep going on, but i want to see what people think of my reaction before i start discussing specific instances of pathetic scenes. all i have to say is it really has to make ya wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees trying ta get it made.j

lil pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. the animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.i laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. after that, the joke wore thin. as a 15-20 minute animated short, lil pimp would have been a classic. instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.weathers, voiced by ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story. eventually, i grew as bored with his remarks as i did the rest of this movie.i am a big fan of south park, and other animation aimed at adults. i also play several online pimp games, so i am partial to stories about pimps. the transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant; but after that, both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable.i give this movie a five. it is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting. just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed.

i mean really, really, really high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. i don't mean regular high, i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches. otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. a complete waste of talent in some cases (bernie mac, john c. mcginley, tom kenny, and the master of hams shatner) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies). not without it's laughs (again chemical aid is crucial) and certainly not without offending the politically over-sensitive (which i'm always in favor of) but ultimately not worth the time out of your life.

one of the commentators on the subject of lil' pimp (dbborroughs of glen cove), got it right when he/she stated that the movie is really bad but i take exception when he/she commented on the animation.the animation wasn't bad because of macromedia flash. it was bad animation because it was directed wrong. flash is just a tool. in the right hands, an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any disney film and, in the wrong hands, it can look as bad as the stuff on the internet, which is where lil' pimp originated and should've stayed there.studios such as cartoon network, nickelodeon, disney, and warner bros., create wonderful animation using flash (i.e., puffy ami yumi, foster's home for imaginary friends, mucha lucha, etc.).lil' pimp was an ill conceived piece of tripe that was made because revolution studios bought media tripp and lil' pimp was one of the properties included. roth and company thought they'd make a quick buck exploiting a turd like lil' pimp and the sham was perpetuated by it's producer, amy pell. the reason for this third trimester abortion of an animated film is that none of the executives at revolution studios had the pragmatic brains to sideline mark brooks and peter gilstrap (they really tried their best but were way in over their heads), and hire real writers, directors and at least a semi-competent producer. they did one thing correctly though, they hired some of the best storyboarders, designers, and animators in la, but as lil' pimp demonstrates, one can buy the best sports car on the floor but if you're a moron, you'll wreck it for sure.

this conglomeration fails so miserably on every level that it is difficult to decide what to say. it doesn't merit one line, much less ten, but to adhere to the rules of imdb, here goes and i probably won't succeed the first time around and have to type some more to make up for this submission to be accepted. lolif i had seen this schlock during the '70s while i was going through my mushroom phase,i would have still considered it unimaginative and shallow. the most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed.i was on the edge of my seat.one person on here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess, as if that were a red letter day in his life. one can only pray that something far more exciting occurs in that posters life.get a grip, amigo.

it looks like people involved with this movie are stuffing the ballot box to boost its ratings. the good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it. i suppose that makes me the 19th. i have no involvement with the flick and don't know anyone who did and i'm a long-time imdb user (check my vote record and reviews over the past seven years), so i promise i'm giving an honest and unbiased opinion. it's coming to you from a 30-year horror fan who has also appeared in a couple of low-budget flicks himself.aside from a couple of interesting video effects, "frankensteins bloody nightmare" is incoherent, boring, and technically flawed beyond all reason. it was apparently shot on silent stock and the audio then dubbed in; most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin can and a piece of string, anyhow. more than three quarters of the dialog is inaudible.i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was, or even if there was one. it seems like the director is mostly impressing himself with long, panning shots of the corners of table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pad the film out. that would be a problem if one were actually developing a plot and making a film that had some sense of pacing. in this case, though, the rule doesn't apply. it doesn't matter how scenes are shot because they don't add up to a story.watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level. whatever people who worked on it are writing and however they're trying to influence the ratings here on imdb, this is just bad, tedious stuff.that's the honest truth. if you're thinking of spending your money or time on this one, think again. it's easy to find something better because you won't find much worse.and that's the unbiased, unvarnished truth.

this is a pretty simplistic romance. girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an oscar nom. equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi. she is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, gary cooper. at first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission. cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him. moore searches for him, is told at a hospital he is dead, then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited.it's a nice little romance, but hardly more than that. recommended for fans of ms. moore and mr. cooper

this film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life. a woman "the ex" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. the women i don't think ever went to acting college. she just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. failing on most occasions. she makes friends with her ex husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. at first when you watch this film, you think that the "ex" wants to kill her ex-husband, maybe because he has treated her in a bad way. but in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. the two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course). my advice to the general public is do not buy this film, do not rent this film and do not watch it like i did (at 1.15am on fox)

totally forgettable and almost unwatchable. if you enjoy bad acting, thin plots and predictably weak outcomes, pull up a chair. of passing interest to see bridget fonda look-a-like suzy amis.

the material is poor....the script's dreadful....the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head.give this one a miss....even yancy butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe.i'm amazed people rave about yancy butler.....given what i've seen here and in the couple of other things i've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star...and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well.last thing is where was this shot? i don't recognise the externals.

my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction. well, not liking either michael douglas or glenn close, i would have to agree. not for conventional reasons though.this is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet.yancy butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. she is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film. everyone else in it varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped pinocchio.spoiler: the ending goes a step or two too far, complete with the cliché not quite dead, up with a roar, still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the make-up.regardless, it's a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film, you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat. don't pay for it but if you're in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right.

the only reason i watched this is because of its stars, caspar van dien, micheal pare & eric roberts & catherine oxenburg * & jeniffer rubin, all capable actors & have given good performances in the past,. not this time,, a weak serial killer story, you can guess who the killer is in the first scene. very contrived in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is *1/2 poor

astounding that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public. i knew it was by uwe boll, & i found it in the bargain bin at a store for $2 (still pretty steep, considering) but morbid curiosity led me to view this, and: 1). i am fairly sure this is a rip-off of seven, silence of the lambs, and american psycho, all rolled into one, with dialog that may have been written by preteens.2). casper van dien plays the main character, and he's so absolutely bizarre and creepy that just about anyone would know he must be the crazed serial killer.3). jennifer rubin plays the "good cop" that invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home cooked dinner, and what does she get for her trouble? i'll let you guess.4). michael pare plays an "intense" cop, who drives a vw bug, new-style, that is, with a siren on it. a vw bug...that'll strike fear into criminal's hearts when they see that coming.5). van dien breaks up with his fiancé, but she still has an "not engaged" party, complete with "not a wedding cake". imagine everyone's surprise he shows up (he was, of course, invited) and they all get shot.6). actually, this should have been #1, really. the killer in this is known as "the monkey maker". this is, without a doubt, the stupidest killer name anyone could have come up with in a million years. presumably it has something to do with the "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" saying, complete with monkeys. it's possible that monkeys had something to do with the script, too.7). oh yeah, and there's a club that van dien visits near the beginning of the film. there's bad disco music, i mean, really bad, and a chain-link fenced cage with, uh, gang members beating the crap out of each other with baseball bats? that's what it looked like. and of course, this is only the tip of the iceberg, the really cool stuff (?!) goes on in the basement, where some questionable "actor" talks some woman into signing a confession before she gets shot, this being, i guess, a snuff movie? not quite sure how this fits in with the rest of the film, and boll probably wasn't either, so if he wasn't worried, then i won't worry.an incredible piece of non-entertainment that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe. a parallel universe that's kind of like ours, but where things are just enough off where they don't seem right. you have entered "the boll zone". exit as quickly as possible, & don't look back.2 out of 10.

i went into this movie with low expectations, knowing uwe boll's legacy as a film director, and screenplay writer, and i was still disappointed. uwe boll finds a way to make each and every movie he is involved in worse and worse. the overall concept wasn't a bad one, a man bored with his life as a stock broker becomes a serial killer. but the problem with the movie is there is no in between, he goes straight from stock broker to serial killer. the film has no-name actors, and i can see why, after watching the movie, i can't see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie. anyone who turned it down did their careers a favor. and if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't.i give sanctimony a 3 out of 10

did uwe boll seriously just rip off the basic idea and dialogue from se7en?! why is it so fekking difficult for this douchebag to be original?! he even mentioned in an interview with gametrailers that he chooses stuff like games to make into movies because the characters, plots, backstories and so on are already there and ready for him to screw with.guess it isn't too much of a stretch for him to rip off another movie entirely...i mean, seriously, what the hell...? here's something i made in uwe's 'honor'...http://zuucka.deviantart.com/art/uwe-boll-is-a-douchebag-70369862

oh, my. oh, this is a *really* bad movie. the acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful.what does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. "oh, s/he died? huh... figured they would" was the best reaction i could muster after each murder. characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who. while the cast's voices had an odd monotone quality throughout, their faces give the impression that you're looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling, exaggerated frowns and "pensive looks". each character is a humorless, passionless, one-dimensional one-trick pony; once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation, they are summarily dismissed.it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen (director/writer of "skyggen", american title: "webmaster") decided to do a low-budget version of "american psycho" and got kind of distracted along the way.this isn't a particularly gruesome movie; the cold, passionless cast ensures that. it isn't an offensive movie; the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so. it is, simply and after all, a bad movie.avoid it. we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on pay-per-view. as part of my penance, i'm writing this review.enough said.

you may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, i looked for the director's name. when i saw it, i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it. this movie is beyond terrible. it makes ed wood's films look like orsen welles. at least b movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. the quality was so bad, i began to wonder who allowed this to happen.i hear uwe boll runs fourteen miles a day. this is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork. the script was terrible, the lighting was like that of a high school football game, and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger patterson's bigfoot video. the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility. in the end was a film alan smithee wouldn't have put his name on. i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances. from what i hear, this is not a bad thing to do.

my friend & i rented this movie and within the first 5 mins we had no idea what was going on. it felt like it should have been over within the first 15 mins. it was a terrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the ones in the movie, and the plot (if you can call it that) was full of holes. never would i recommend this movie to my worst enemy, yet anybody i actually like.

this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as i remember it being.the story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. the thing i wanted to know throughout was, to do what exactly? you never find out what they want. nigel davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted, and begin to study the ants from an impregnable igloo shaped laboratory. probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops (like a square version of a crop circle) a result of the ants chomping away.this film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them. all you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks - but you don't find out whether they are really baddies. it ain't a sci-fi because the 'cosmic event' explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account. it is deffo more of a chiller. tbh the flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and nigel davenports unnaturally big facial hair-do freaked me out more than the ants! did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? yup, that right - six, and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all. not even in the distance! this is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it. i can't think of any anyway. the filming of the ants is pretty good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film. you may well say to yourself 'how the hell do they get the ants to do that?' over and over, but it is all quite simple. you will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film too, so animal rights peeps stay away! good for novelty value, but you may not watch it more than once.

humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of the wog boy seemed to enjoy it more than i did. i found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. the boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between lucy bell and nick giannopoulos while i found laughs thin on the ground. if you want to spend your money on this, wait until it's on video.

i'm glad i didn't pay to see 'the wog boy'.i sat there hopefully waiting for something original and/or funny to happen.it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s.i won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes

i really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes i hardly cracked a smile. i agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden. the script totally wasted the talents of bud tingwell and kim gyngell.it must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end. perhaps i just couldn't relate to it enough. i'm just glad i went on cheap tickets.

this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back!

this is the first movie i have watched in ages where i actually ended up fast forwarding through the tedious bits which there are plenty of. very ordinary movie. i'm glad i missed it at the movies & got a 2 for 1 video deal which included this movie instead.

after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs. in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent. the wog boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void.a scene where the two 'wog boys' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. the only character that was worth watching was 'nathan', played by the castle's stephen curry, his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs.a word for this flic is boring. save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it.

... breaker morant and romper stomper . it has also given us watchable films such as bootmen and the odd angry shot . unfortunately for everyone involved in this debacle the wog boy won't be joining appearing in either list .i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title , so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc 2 late at night the announcer didn't even mention the movie's name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief . it did drop in disbelief , i found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit the problem lies with the cast and the script . i do know that australia with its small population doesn't have a large pool of actors so i'll be forgiving for the most part , but this doesn't stop my criticism of nick giannopoulos as steve . for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and i'm sorry to say but nick g just doesn't have the skills . i'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances . here however he's just plain irritating , unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera . the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed , i mean who thought a running gag about a female minster of work who's having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with ? you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said " look mate , this screenplay's not nearly good enough . go and make it more subtle and structured "i've been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review . i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasn't for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a " dole blodger " . this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment . such a pity that they didn't come with a much better written movie

i'm starting to wonder, after reading some of the opinions here, if i watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts i am forced to the sad conclusion that i have.this witless wannabee screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest 94 minutes i have spent, and one of the most unfunny things i have seen, for ages. now don't get me wrong, i love screwball comedies, but this boring, set-bound drivel falls so far short of the dizzy heights of preston sturges and howards hawks that it doesn't deserve (to mix my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as those greats. writer / director charles martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle or interesting - and there's so much of it. he doesn't know how to end a scene either, with some ruthless cutting, especially of people exiting rooms and saying goodbye to each other, the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and motiveless things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, and move in and out of apartments, at a moment's notice only to move what little plot there is forward. one moment people are desperately yearning for one person, the next they are getting married to someone else - having wooed and been wooed off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us - "oh, they're getting married!" (usually after someone has made a faux-pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). if we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we, the audience, might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them. as it is the characters just come over looking like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them.the sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play. the only moments of relief from the tedium are keenan wynn who looks like he has wandered in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around him.highly avoidable.

since i'd bought the dvd, i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. complications ensue.douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. he's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. the problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.the plot rambles on. a dozen "quirky" characters come and go -- most prominently keenan wynn as douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing.well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. some gags are silly. others don't clear that bar. here's what i thought of as an amusing line. douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. wynn asks if she liked douglas's previous book, "last year's love." yes, of course she did. "well, most of 'last year's love' was done in the beach house." ha ha.nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. there have been better sitcoms on television.

ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard. after falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. the movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? many scenes feature a shrieking baby. the movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why jimmy stewart can't grow a pair. who wanted to see this? who wanted to see stewart and lombard without laughs or charm?it's absolutely depressing and unendurable.

i decided to watch this movie because i'd not seen carol lombard before in any movie. i'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn, both of whom were great actors.the problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (john manson played by stewart) who marries jane (played by lombard) within an hour of meeting her. what's that cliché? marry in haste, repent at leisure... in short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with john's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, john's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, john jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.how many more clichéd situations could the writers include? maybe mother dying soon after? there wasn't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. only the acting of the four main players was adequate.this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.so, it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol' home spun american values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative  all against the backdrop of the "average" american family. who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard? and, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938  soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii. hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join england in war. as many here would know, hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war.however, i'm glad i saw it  as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. but, i'll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.as another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.

extremely formulaic with cosmic-sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy. aw, poor nyc lawyer! he's just scraping by, and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn't go out to find another job, though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm. at home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house.the only character you want to root for is the final maid, who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them! (the bit's not played for laughs.)sorry, just too unbelievable and with a **spoiler** pat, everyone-turns-180-degrees ending. how'd they get top-notch stars for this? if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite.

carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. some are capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. there's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. it's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable. only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts, such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.

when i bought 4 dvds for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions. with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat. as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. however, i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying 'never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by. this should sum up everyone's life. pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.

this film doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with. it works best early on as romantic comedy, but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process. by the last fifteen minutes or so, the plot twists are just a series dramatic clichés. the part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in.the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of jimmy stewart's films.

james stewart plays johnny mason, lawyer. carole lombard is jane mason, wife. lucile watson the mother-in-law harriet mason. johnny sees jane and quickly marries her. mother is disappointed. mother lives with them. many troubles are ahead. jane can't cook. can't set the table. can't do many things according to mother. the interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. stewart and lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. stewart is stewart. he is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film. can baby mason build bridges between jane and harriet? a believable film for those that are married.

this movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career. our mithunda was all time good at his work .atleast he has some good to the movie. i didn't like imraan for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie

taran adarsh a reputed critic praised such a dubba moviethe film has a weird story wherein a lover sells his love to a brothel cos he wants money to save his mother and then also gets forgived for it lolthe movie is crapthe entire first half has it's focus on romance, comedy which fails to work the twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clichéddirection by aditya datt is bad music is typical himeshemraan does his serious role well but his wardrobe, his way of walking through songs.etc is similar to his previous films geeta bhasra annoys ashmith patel fails to convince this actor was good in murder only so far and then a downhill mithun some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced ranjeet is okay

avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment.it is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school. seriously, where to they get these people from? just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress.asmit patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film. he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder.

i haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! talk about so bad it made me laugh!firstly, i estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length, i couldn't tell what was happening, or indeed even what i was seeing. i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets lsd. there are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable stuff. i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening, but they couldn't follow it any better than me.then there are the "black" moments, when in an effort to scare us (woooooooo) everyone's lights go out and the screen turns pitch black - and i don't just mean for a few seconds. i think the longest lasted almost two minutes. i guess blank film is one way to keep costs down...i suspect the "director" had recently read a book on all the "must-do's" to make a scary movie, and decided to throw them all in - about 20 times each.there are three good things about this film: 1/ it's short at 90 minutes (though still an hour and a half too long!) 2/ all the characters die (after all, it's impossible to care about any of them). 3/ there was one genuinely good scene - when the group are looking up the shaft they came down, after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom (saw that coming), a large boulder is pushed across the opening, sealing them in. i wasn't expecting that, and it was genuinely chilling.and what's with the early campfire scenes with the shot, after shot, after shot panning from behind the camp lights. i swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes.and i'm positive that after the first kill, the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds.all in all, a crap piece of film making. i'll watch almost anything, but this is close to where i'd draw the line.

i am an avid movie watcher and i enjoy a wide variety of films. however, i found no enjoyment in this movie. it is probably the worst movie i have ever seen. i do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. it is definitely not in the same category as "the cave" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made. even "the descent" was better than this movie.it was a waste of the $3.79 rental fee and of my time to watch this. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one.

i have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. you get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. it really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. i have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, i imagine that caves are dark. showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home. i quite enjoyed "the descent" which, for my money had better acting, showed more tight caving situations, better monsters and had a good ending.****spoiler******the monster turns out to be some guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed, leaving him to grow up in the caves. he seems to have developed super strength and speed, but why is never addressed - maybe the same force that drained their torch batteries caused this but during the film whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something large with claws that tears up each victim (see how much blood splatters the walls!) but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask? i would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case. then he starts raping the last remaining caver and roll credits... almost absurdly bad i thought. sometimes a film is soo bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh, but this films fails to take itself lightly as well. you watched it, you can't unwatch it!

if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would. i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, i'll spend £10 and buy it. all i got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. absolutely awful, i don't even know where to begin. i have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it. the plot is basically, 7 people go into an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. no-one else knows they are there. when they get in the cave, they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster. there turns out to be no reason for the reporter. one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago... there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either, just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume? anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life. this for no reason makes him superhuman, able to glow, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in 2 places at once and have insane strength (able to move boulders, carry grown men as dead weight, etc). in the end scene there are 2 women left alive, they wake up naked, just covered in some bit of rug or something. they then find a picture of a kid. the monster then bursts in the door, wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head (says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull, if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life) and quite literally goes "raaahhh" like a kiddie on halloween. i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing. the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave. that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story. the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one, cut to end credits. i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film. he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene.there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end. aside from all this, the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off. an absolutely terrible film. you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it, it would be money better spent, as like some clever person posting above me said, once you've watched it, you can't un watch it.

i consented to watching this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike for horror movies. however, it was not the shock of a monster that turned me off this movie, it was the horrendous acting and absolutely disgusting ending. within, or the cavern, has no redeeming qualities- it is poorly made, laughably scripted, sickeningly bloody and the inclusion of the gratuitous final scene repulses me. no, it is not my dislike for horror movies that makes me hate this film-i've seen such wonderful teen horrors as "house of wax", its the fact that the film leaves you with the awful understanding that by renting the video, you are supporting the creators of within

what a shocker. for starters, i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. the jerky camera movements were also annoying. the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. and then there's the ending. i'm still not really sure what to make of it. i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.the case had a couple of those little award winner/nominations symbols on it, so i figured it couldn't be too bad. i was wrong. if you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.

if it is true that the movie only cost 150k to make, it explains a lot. but, it doesn't explain why it has no real plot. midway through the movie i honestly didn't care if they made it out or not. i just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. the ending was really dumb and made me wish i would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early. pretty good acting considering there wasn't much to go with. if you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting (even for a cave)and bad camera work (even for a cave)... then you'll really like this movie. by the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so, how could he have forgotten how to speak, and built up so much anger?? wouldn't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later?

the person who wrote the summary and rave review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies. from the beginning, this just spoke of cheap-ass ripoff of "the descent", a far superior film that definitely does not start off slow.from the very first moments of "the cavern", i was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and unoriginal it was, how badly written, badly acted and badly directed it was. this is without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life, and that's saying a lot, considering i recently suffered through "pulse". i can't believe this piece of garbage actually won awards, which just goes to show the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in australia and other countries than in the u.s.the scenes where the group is running from the "creature" are badly directed, especially the retarded "upside-down-camera", intended to show disorientation, but only coming off as a cheap effect which a first-year film student would be suitably berated for by their teacher.sadly, this "director" will probably go on to make other movies, more than likely of the same low quality as this "film", since i'm sure he hasn't learned from his mistakes, which on this picture were excessive.if i had my way, the entire cast and crew would be sent up the river for life without parole. this film is a crime against humanity.

i love movies...and rarely do i see a movie that i hate...but this was the worst movie i have ever seen, or at least close to it. any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. hands down... i cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. i'm really mad, i want my money back and my time back. awful! do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful. i didn't know what was going on during half the movie cause i could not see it(and i was watching on a very nice, and big, tv) rent saw, the hills have eyes, or house of wax...any of those are better if u want something scary.

horror films are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well, sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems, sometimes they're so bad they're actually kinda fun...and sometimes they're "the cavern".a good horror/suspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die. however, the cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first, only to be negated by it's own lackluster storytelling.all the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue, making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way.(to spoil a scene a bit, one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasn't reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick macaroni and cheese) add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many nine inch nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level.i'll be honest with you, if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch "the descent", and i feel weird saying that because i didn't particularly enjoy that movie either.

i can't say if "the cavern" is a ripoff of "the cave" because i haven't seen that. i've seen "the descent" and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one. hard to watch, as in, there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at. there are times when i guess, you're supposed to be scared, judging from the music, but scared of what? bad camera work? poor lighting? if that's the case than this should be the scariest movie made. the story is that a bunch of cave explorers go to a cave in kazakhstan (home of borat) and make their descent, but something is (of course) in there with them. and what is it? one guy says it's a wolf/bear hybrid, that is, just before he gets ripped apart, but whatever it is, you can't see it. and just when you think (or hope) the film is ending, since the screen goes dark for a bit, you see the two remaining cavers (the two women) wake up somewhere in betty and wilma attire and start trying to find their way out of wherever they are. they do drink some water and start eating something until they figure out what it is and start puking....and then the mystery of what's in the cave appears, and you'll just be astounded. maybe, maybe not. dumb dumb dumb....i think i'm pretty well done with cave movies at this point, 2 out of 10.

first let me say that those of you that voted it "10" are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level... something that this movie doesn't deserve. (the only movies deserving a 10 imo are the classics... godfather, shawshank, etc. look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list.) i also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave. though i would have to agree with them on the surroundings, they simply aren't rating the movie as a whole... they are infatuated by the surroundings but miss the overall review. that would be like me voting a 10 for the movie "from justin to kelly" because i think that the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the florida keys... though that may be true, it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was rancid.i wish i could tell you that something saved this movie, as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick, something else picks up or makes up for the weakness. (ex. - bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot and/or great camera work and scenery.) we started the dvd and it all started out fairly normal. we jokingly started to pick out who would be the first to die... after a brief bit of driving and hiking, they set up camp for the night. at that moment, i keyed in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film. two main problems i had: bad effects and an even worse story line. the first thing that we all noticed was that the campfires weren't real... you can plainly see the "cgi" or fake flames that they were all sitting at. for a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what i was in for the next hour.only minutes later, i was shown how poorly written this film was. i don't remember exactly how they arrived at the point, but basically, we find out that the "token nerd" is writing a book about exploring caves, etc. another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates stating "i don't want this story in your book." the author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (a direct quote: "if i tell you the story, you will definitely want it in your book.") at this point, i was fully expecting a nice 5+ minute story, complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. what i got was a short, poorly told (and acted) statement. i say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. i don't remember the exact quotes, but basically he says: "we were in a cave, the cave flooded, a girl died as our friend watched her drown." you may think i am over exaggerating and being really critical, but that isn't far off from a direct quote, line for line, from the movie scene.over the next 50 minutes or so, the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what i would imagine to be like in a cave, i could have really done without the really fuzzy/hazy look to the film, and the camera shaking is just one that i didn't go for. (i have really good vision, and after watching the main parts of the film, i felt like i was legally blind.) i was emotionally detached from this movie, therefore the parts that probably should have been scary weren't. maybe had i been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film, i would have at least been scared, but i don't remember anyone in the dark room even twitching at any of the "action" scenes.the last scene was probably one i will never forget, and that isn't a good thing. basically, two women are trapped in a room naked. the "monster" comes in to attack/kill the women... he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. a flashback occurs where we find out that the "monster" was injured as a little boy, and spent his entire life in the cave. cut back to present time, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt). he glances at the picture and the two women appear to have found the caveman's weakness/soft spot. at that point, he stabs and kills one girl, then proceeds to rape the other woman, rather graphically. after about 30 seconds of watching the camera jiggle and shake as he rapes her, roll the credits, movie's over.honestly, if i had to do it all over and i wasted money on renting this movie, i could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that i have now.those of you comparing this to blair witch are way off... if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of blair would realize how revolutionary it was... handing each cast member a script the day/night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius.if imdb would let me, it would get a negative score... i don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.

a group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in kazakhstan. in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, the cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an x-file. i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. not being a caver, it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic. there is entirely too much unnecessary pannick from supposedly experienced cavers, by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things  oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves, or i hope you all die by the end. it must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film. a moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters. while you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. but i would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor. it just wasn't necessary. i suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel. i've long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme. you pay for the materials to make the film before you go in, but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. i can't blame what i don't like about this film on its low budget.

sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". we should all pay more attention to that little voice. this may be the worst movie i've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your dvd player has a fast-forward button. made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, "the cavern" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like "the cave" and "the descent". a few years back there was similar rash of look-alike movies that used sea-going vessels instead of caves. all had scary boats/submarines-lots of darkness-claustrophobic adventurers-unknown menaces...same old same old. "the cavern" is really "the blair witch project" only this time we're lost under the earth and not lost on top of it. throw in a flashlight with failing batteries, a cow skull with fangs glued on it for a monster, and one of the stupidest "twist" climaxes ever put on film. that being said, let me urge you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. i'm your friend. i want you to have a happy life. stay away from this movie.

when i checked out the review for this film after i'd watched it, i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings.this is a film of bad camera-work. everything 'frightening' happens off screen, usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling "did you see/hear that?" well, no, we didn't see that! we can't! and when there weren't any close-ups, the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down, or shaking back and forth really, really quickly, to either convey action or to make us physically sick.the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes, they started screaming the same thing over and over again. i don't care if that's what it would 'really' be like, i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! i expect unreasonable things, like aliens, demons, or good acting! they were stupid, too- let's go have intimate relations in a cave! with all of our clothes on! speaking of which, the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died. this bugged me a bit, though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a... serious invasion of one girl's privacy.no plot, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera-work. what's left? oh, right. the ending may have had a 'twist' but generally with horror movies, the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film. sixth sense does- it explains a lot. hide and seek did, too. but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an 'explanation', if you could call it that as it doesn't. explain. anything.don't see it. please.

michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u.s army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner, which is hampered by too many long pauses without action, but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james' performance.

i couldn't stop laughing, i caught this again on late night tv. "i suppose you think you're some kind of hero for bringing my daughter back alive" "no" "good"haha.

this review contains a spoiler---the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts. he falls for the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the "people's hero" at the end of the film. this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched. it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality. good for kids under 14. the military errors in this film is comical. i remember during my three years in the military, us privates were not required to salute or call nco's "sir", the film does this in various spots. the colonel's hair is way too long on the ears. the master sergent's moustache was against military protocol in length. on the post, the colonel was the only officer around. not one other officer was shown walking around the post. you had idiot ninjas brandshing swords against troops with m-16's, rather poorly made.folks this filmed reeked. michael dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts. the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. avoid this film

i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. living in taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in america. i have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. i seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. how sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what i thought should have been titled "generic ninja fight scene, op. 1" or "variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girl's head when backed into a corner" or the daring "flight of the helicopter". then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled. those actually had me in tears laughing. if the "special effects" weren't proof enough that this was low-budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably locals which although good for the much-needed phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money, have ever done anything since this series of movies. they rented equipment, despite making sequels to this movie. that was pretty funny too. the thing that really had me going though, was not the music (which left me half expecting an animated sargeant slaughter from g.i. joe to pop up), but the ending...i suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil, but when the american ninja drops the girl into jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch him.i think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.

young michael dudikoff like young lord greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on a pacific island as an infant. but instead of being raised by the apes, he fell into the hands of a japanese soldier who was still living there because he hadn't heard the war was over. and like young luke skywalker it turns out he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninja.good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of amnesia, but those fighting skills didn't go away. the orphaned kid, now named joe armstrong enlists in the army and gets himself stationed in the phillipines. meanwhile his obi wan kenobe played by john fujioka gets rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist go between don stewart using a cheesy accent that seems to vary between french and spanish.as these things happen everybody meets and dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officer's daughter from the bad guys in this golan-globus production. charles bronson was getting a bit long in the tooth now and golan-globus needed a new star for their action flicks. michael dudikoff filled the bill quite nicely and made quite a few films for them including several american ninja sequels.this film is all action and dudikoff dispatches bad guys at a record pace. what he doesn't do, steve james does doing his best rambo imitation and showing his considerable martial arts skills.the film has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story. but that's what the ticket buying public doesn't care about. dudikoff certainly looks magnificent stripped to his fighting clothes. no wonder so many sequels were made.

this is the first porn i've ever tried to review. it demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. "i'm american. i'm a prudish virgin." "we are european. we are cultured and sex-mad." "it is nice when we all screw each other." lots to talk about! well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. and the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions. but what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn? ok then: the only scene i really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time brigitte maier steps in. there are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus. and multiple takes or not, one perhaps undescribable-on-imdb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose. still, i stayed awake, and it was eight in the morning...but what does the last shot mean?!

there are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. the breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. it's always good to remember, that david hasselhoff is a god. not the god, but a god. it's not so much about his acting skills, since there are none, but his chesthair does a lot of talking. also, there's no kitt hanging out in this series, which is good, since mr hasselhoff told in an interview, that he always thought kitt was gay. naturally that might make him to look like an idiot, but considering the other statements he has made lately, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone.in a nutshell, this is the kind of show, that is totally harmless to people. it gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at, which is something many intentionally humoristic shows really don't give us. i have to say, it's no wonder that borat fell in love with pamela anderson. i enjoy watching the show. no, it's not a great show, actually it's quite horrible, but i enjoy watching it. it's basically like a b-movie stretched to last for a decade.

although the movie was only so so the closed captioning was by far the best i have ever seen! most of the time the spelling is terrible and the captioning out of sync. i use the closed captioning even though i can hear well but find a lot of actors mumble. also many times the sound track overrides the dialogue. thanks!

this movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used cd/dvd store. i only own it because it came in a box set which i bought for the masterpiece "deadfall". the store bought back the other two movies i was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? so i tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget dvds that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back underworld either. this movie is bad on every level, and is one of those that came out in the post-tarantino-clone glut of the mid 90's. the only slightly redeemable element is dennis leary telling joe montegna, that he's a "stinky friend" and calls him "mister stinky friend". that line is so delightfully horrible, that i can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a stinky friend. but now that i've enlightened you with that quote, you don't have to go thru the pain of watching this movie.

i guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.this is a morons delight. the worst stereo-types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable. every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked.***spoiler*** how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place?

i've seen worse, which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was. the plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage? in a dimly-lit, smoky new york school -- and somehow this clichéd hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? are you serious? a day-long hostage situation -- with a wounded nypd officer no less, takes all day? i realize this film was made pre-9/11, but still. i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes.the acting was mediocre at best all-around, and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders. the child-abuse kid, the pregnant scared girl, the violent gang wannabe, a confused unfortunate victim, the wise-cracking white guy. please.trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? please -- this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop. they're confused, ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb -- far-fetched -- situation. don't try and paint them, suddenly, as noble, the most laughable is ziggy, who lives in the school's attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. you've got to be kidding me.the "no racism" signs in the protesting crowd? a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up. this is a random message.i understand the overall message, which was poorly portrayed, albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers.this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof? the worst scene was the kid, fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof, "promise me" etc. how original.the epilogue of "i went to prison but now i'm pre-law at xyz university" ... a fitting way to end a joke of a movie.

"crimes of passion" is a film that is disappointing on most counts. where should i start from? the plot? it is despairingly simplistic and full of gaps. the direction? reminds a cheap b-movie. the acting? john laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as "well-intentioned-husband-of-a-frozen-wife" bobby, annie pots is unconvincing as "frozen-wife" amy, and it is only kathleen turner (above average), and antony perkins (excellent) which get passable acting marks. more specifically, antony perkins gives a great performance as the pervert reverend peter shayne, while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and frail joanna crane satisfactorily.unfortunately, the performances of turner and perkins alone are insufficient to help get the film a grade higher than 4/10. watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes (although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competition-"basic instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.

if you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie (bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be), you must try this one. it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth, and you can just about smell the urine on the floor. kathleen turner struts around in a blond wig, getting her kicks from "pretending" to be a two-bit hooker (she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect), and tony perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is out to maybe murderer her (yet another movie that ends with tony perkins in drag). annie potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, which is reason enough to hate this movie. the kinky will love the sex scenes, so rent the unrated version in the red box so you can see turner give a cop a taste of his billy club (i had to pause the vcr until we stopped laughing).

ken russell directed this weird ( not very ) erotic thriller and if i hadn't known that i would have staked my life that the director was brian depalma . absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams depalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams " depalma , depalma , depalma "unfortunately since brian depalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans hitchcock over the years russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . sure an erotic thriller in the style of tommy or billion dollar brain would have been bizarre with a capital b but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . oh and anthony perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . yawn the only thing of any real note to crimes of passion is the controversy it caused . i guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity , but as for the controversial sex scenes ... what controversial sex scenes ? there aren't any and the only controversy i can think of is of china blue dominating an on duty policeman with a truncheon . needless to say he didn't come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

a few yrs ago, i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell. this theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that rozzie r. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).i thought of this essay after watching 'crimes of passion'.kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue. she's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by anthony perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading. and she won't let either of them have a piece of her until ...i won't give away the ending - but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boy's fantasy. no matter how hard ken russell tries, he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation. except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old black-and-white films look revolutionary by comparison.

the worst part of all is the poor scripting, leading to superficial acting.dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match.holly hunter's character is exaggeratedly self-centered, and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting, as usual.brad johnson was wooden. john goodman made the best of it.furthermore, the whole death / ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone, and now appears rather lame. barely watchable only if you like old aeroplanes.

this film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. why introduce rachel, for instance? she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her "follow me" truck to run wild and crash into dorinda's fence. that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a b-26 or an a-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. that serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. as it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. the ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk -- as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. here, dreyfuss just babbles on and on. the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities/impossibilities that i won't describe. what a dull and disjointed effort!

"a lot of the films i've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because i have a lot of old-fashion values." - steven spielbergsome points..1. though this film is a loose remake of "a guy named joe", it also borrows heavily from "a matter of life and death" and "wings of desire".2. this was spielberg's second attempt at being frank capra. 3. spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a "frank capra movie" in the vein of "it's a wonderful life" and "mrs smith goes to washington". judging from his recent attempts to get a "harvey" remake off the ground, it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream, the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into capracorn.4. critics at the time bashed "always", stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance, but that's really not the problem at all. the problem is that "always" needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point.5. the film is filled with comedy that just doesn't work. spielberg's comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated, and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's screwballs and looney tune cartoons. these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe, but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage.6. the film's lead couple come across as brother and sister, not lovers. spielberg's films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extreme lengths: she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man. they're more irritating than endearing.7. the film contains one good scene, in which john goodman argues with holly hunter, but for the most part the film's characters are too annoying. there's no subtlety, every emotion overplayed, every joke over designed, every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness.8. "always" and "hook" taught spielberg how to con audiences. after their failure (and the twin financial failures of "the color purple" and "empire of the sun") spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of "color purple" and "empire of the sun" in favour for the more desaturated "black and white" worlds of "schindler's list", "munich", "minority report" and "saving private ryan". from here on, "less light" and "dark cinematography" became equated with "serious topics".9. after the financial success of each "dark film" spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography, and falls flat on his face once again. "amistad" followed "schindler's list", "ai" followed "ryan" and "lincoln" will follow "munich". these "colour" films are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but the truth is, if you removed the desaturation, all these "serious" films would feel the same way.10. since the 70s, spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors (scorsese, de palma, coppola etc), by pretending to be an "optimist" and "humanist". he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s. the reality, though, is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their content, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. 11. the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in "always", and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. people running from dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, tripods, rocks etc...this is what spielberg delights in. the moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self-destructs. a film like "amistad" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.12. the film's flying scenes aren't up to the standard's set several years earlier in the mega-hit "top gun". of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to make things cinematic.13. failures like "1941", "hook", "always" etc are often more illuminating that spielberg's more successful films. they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working, revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery.5/10  there's one good sequence here (two actors in a room, simply improvising), but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script.worth one viewing.

so when bob and marion boxletter see a guy at a hotel, marion believes it is her long lost brother brian, but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face. marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after tracing his whereabouts. they get a hold of brian, but still he doesn't know what they are talking about, but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey... and even when they see joey he doesn't know them either. the plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well. experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me. personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great, but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little suspense yes but that's it.

i had to watch this movie for a film class, i suffered the whole time through. i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film. the film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (rex harrison isn't even asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians. in addition, there has been critical attention given to biography of anna. many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner. some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story. an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.

i have just caught this movie on tcm, and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him. it is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. it featured two of my favouriteplayers in eve arden (completely wasted) and dean stockwell(the best actor in the film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady frances gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical. john hodiak played his role ok, but the script let him, and the rest of the cast, down very badly. i gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography. it would have been on the first half of the program when double features were the go.

in london, the venetian carla borin (yuliya mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend matteo (jarno berardi). she meets the lesbian real estate agent moira (francesca nunzi) and rents a large apartment. when the jealous matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard (mauro lorenz) in venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. when matteo comes to london, he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior."transgredire" is another "soft porn" of the sick director tinto brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast. the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful yuliya mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is abused, touched and licked in every part of her nice body, but without showing explicit penetration. this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing yuliya mayarchuk naked in erotic situations. my vote is four.title (brazil): "a pervertida" ("the pervert")

if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as i'm concerned. this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. a good movie has to start and end strong. it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. there are so many other movies from asia to watch, many of which i am sure most of you have not seen, that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere. why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews? i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film.

if you're in the mood for a really bad porno with no good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. however, if you breathe air, make sure you spend your time watching anything but this. the acting is crappy. the "plot" is crappy. they try too hard, and the whole time i was waiting for the one good redeeming scene that might make the movie worth watching. nope. stick with the scrambled cable.

"yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "the shogun's samurai") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. as an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting sonny chiba. before this movie's halfway point, i was even tempted to commit seppuku! the music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by ennio morricone (that's not an insult towards morricone). the use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating. and in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks. what a terrible movie.

i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well. compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. the plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which i cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. the music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! on top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely destroys and undermines the entire picture. it turns out that the end isn't true but was completely "fudged". what's the point of this, then? if you have seen this film, understand that there are many better films out there, so don't give up!

director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun's samurai and battles without honor and humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. this film has other flaws as well. the makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were substandard as well, inferior to other samurai films of earlier years (seven samurai comes to mind). sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun's samurai, the no-nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film, scowling menacingly. what a guy; he even gets to wear an eye patch. if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo, and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting, he disappears for good. overall, the strengths of the film are its story, which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films, and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil. two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father, who may have had some help on his way out. early on, it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil; after all, the older brother stammers and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a winner-takes-all struggle for power, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.

in this film, there is a loose plot of a man (bardem) who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business, and marries a woman he does not love (the wide-eyed maria de medieros) in the process. he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web. he never gives up his juggling act, until the three main characters come face to face. the film results boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, incoherent and of course, too much stupid. none of the characters are believable, which makes the movie a little annoying. anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film, which makes it a little interesting, but, if you can, watch another film please!

a bit too much mediterrenean machismo for me. the cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. the locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. it just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. only in the mediterranean i guess. certainly in no world i am familiar with. the macho men were really obnoxious, and i found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long. the screenplay, cinematography, directing, etc. was set up to deliver a class b film, the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. it was aesthetically nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film.

thank god i have fast-forward. i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. whatever: it's a stupid cliché. it doesn't make any difference. there's this guy, javier bardem, who constructs buildings or something. it doesn't matter. he is handsome, this javier bardem. who cares? i think there is a car wreck but i watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me. javier likes someone , but he marries maria de madeiros instead.she is magnificently, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. then javier has an oral-interface with maribel verdu, who washes her vulva, beforehand, for some reason. you would think maribel verdu, with her hand-washed vulva would be sexy. no, she is not. this is a tedious story about a bunch of people who don't interest me. javier, maribel, and maria have a threesome: how boring. this film is annoying. i think this might be a minor theme of (some) spanish-language movies: the rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds against the odds. let me just clear this up: this is a high-class melodrama or perhaps soap opera. it is not worth your time, except for a laugh.

with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class. there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider. this can be pretty annoying.symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the movie alludes to the work of salvador dalí, luis buñuel and the surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to duchamp's ready mades. what's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of julio iglesias. but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me. i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital, impetuous, boorish vulgarity of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. how all the really pretty women run after him (the main character, i mean) is slightly disconcerting.the movie has three parts. it starts in the spanish enclave of melilla in africa, where benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the corps of engineers. then it moves on to the resort town of benidorm in spanin where benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper of the place and become a vulgarized howard roark. for the last part a defeated benito moves to miami, florida, presumably in order to start a new life". but the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily. it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic. it must be said that javier bardem acquits himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and deflated.i purchased this movie because i am interested in townscapes. and benidorm is a kind of a special place, townscapewise. in this aspect huevos de oro satisfied me only partially. in jess franco's she killed in ecstasy (1970) this specific location was used in a more rewarding way.

when watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how barrie's life played out? you watch it in a posture of disagreement. hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. your story would resemble "rocky" because it's the only life-arc hollywood knows how to produce anymore. we couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. this movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them. i perceived the captain hook/mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. i could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.this is a completely average movie. not horrible but not great. hence it's likely to be showered with a few oscars next year. there's nothing the academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.from the new yorker article "lost boys" by anthony lane: "arthur llewelyn davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of "finding neverland" to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that johnny depp meets kate winslet, she is already a widow, whereas arthur was very much alive when barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the llewellyn davies family."finding neverland" is a weepie. from the moment that barrie met george and jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907arthur llewellyn davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910sylvia dies of lung cancer. the five boys are orphaned; barrie is made their guardian. 1915george is killed in the first world war, fighting with his regiment in flanders. 1921michael, an undergraduate at oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. the two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.on april 5, 1960, peter llewellyn davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in london. we should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in "peter pan""that terrible masterpiece," in the words of peter llewellyn davies.

a previous imdb reviewer has stated that 'rafter romance' is a 'rip-off' (that's the other reviewer's term) of a german musical called 'me by day, you by night'. apparently that reviewer is unaware that *both* of these films have borrowed their premise from 'box and cox', an english play written by john maddison morton in 1847. this play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady, each man believing himself the sole tenant. because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not discovered straight away. this play was once so popular in britain that 'to box and cox it' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person.the innovation of 'rafter romance' (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a romance. as is usual in these cornball movies, the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other's arms. hoo boy.the landlord in this film is played by george sidney, a character actor who specialised in playing jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic. george sidney was never as annoying as the odious harry green (the jewish equivalent of stepin fetchit) but sidney's depictions of jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch.the single most notable thing about 'rafter romance' is that, to my knowledge, this is the earliest hollywood film to make reference to hitler and the rise of nazism. at one point in this movie, landlord eckbaum (sidney) discovers his teenage son julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls. eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be jewish. admittedly, nobody in hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what hitler was planning for the jews in europe ... still, it's surprising to see a film depicting a jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke. his father is, quite properly, angered by this display of the nazi symbol.a very shameful aspect of hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major hollywood studios continued to do business with the third reich as late as 1939. hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as 'aryan' so that their films could be distributed in nazi germany and austria. for the same reason, hollywood's leading men were documented as 'aryan and uncircumcised'. except for darryl zanuck at twentieth century-fox, all the hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with hitler. i'm surprised that 'rafter romance' contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably, as this sequence would have rendered the film verboten in germany and austria. (maybe the scene was cut out for german release: it isn't crucial to the movie's plot.) apart from this, the movie contains nothing notable. robert benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation: i've never understood the appeal of this man. i'll rate 'rafter romance' 4 out of 10.

for this movie, based off of a tv show, and a serious finale. i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'm*a*s*h goodbye, farewell, and amen' was pretty good, but not this one. unless you really love the series (like myself) skip this movie.i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and dave coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever. they shouldn't have used tim meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script.i thought the movie was pure cheese. i would give it a 4.5/10

for a film made in senegal, based, i guess loosely on carmen, the book, by prosper merimee, this film doesn't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films.ms. gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at. her fiery dancing smolders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film.this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real carmen, she is not!we would like to see ms. gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.

i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.i went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical - since people break into song every few minutes.none of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a "tune."karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids i've ever seen. [the actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling.]the film opens in a women's prison, although not like any prison i've ever seen or heard of -- the inmates wear whatever they wish - and seem to be having a party.karmen does some frantic dancing, and the woman warden of the prison, angelique,[a magnificently handsome woman]is definitely erotically interested. she and karmen dance together. later karmen visits the warden's room and they make love - unfortunately the scene is not detailed, and is very short, although there is some nudity.karmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man, named lamine, maybe a colonel - it was never really clear who he was, watches her. he is with a young woman who dislikes karmen's seductive dancing and there is a dance-off between the two women.after that the story [such as it is] becomes even more muddled.with lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where.karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves.there is more singing. more dancing, and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak.the film muddles its way to a finish, and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended. 

this very loose retelling of carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-frank dance between senaglese prisoner "karmen" and her female prison warden, but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. one minute karmen is all sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government, and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual "karmen," the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange of "basic-instinct" meets "bound" meets an african version of a bollywood musical.

i walk out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that i couldn't bear to watch any longer. as far as the awards it won goes, the ones awarded by turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. my only explanation for the queens festival award was to think that somehow a layer of comedy was "gained in translation" as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances.at the beginning of the screening i attended, the presenter briefly talked about the history of turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early turkish cinema was appropriately named "stage cinema" since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene.ironically, this movie falls right into that category. english speakers reading subtitles may think that turkish is a naturally loud language and attribute all the yelling in the movie to that, but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices. you could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors, but the biggest source of "yelled-out-dialog" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the movie. not surprisingly his background is in theater. my guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines, all other amateur actors raised their voices as well, hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances.put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a snail's pace, you get an extremely boring movie.i have to say i also have a personal problem with turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow uneducated characters. ever since "zugurt aga", one of the best turkish movies ever made, turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country. this is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in zugurt aga. most often, however, it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native "urban" turks. rural communities make up a neglected, undereducated part of the country, and while this provides good material for comedy, it comes at a huge cost to turkey's image.a western audience member whose only exposure to turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that turkey is like afghanistan. i wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and stay loyal to the majority of the country, who live in cities that put metropolitan areas in europe to shame.

although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast, ice-cream, i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.the plot opens with the dream of ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a western anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. he dreams of playing in his product's tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. as his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. is it because he is not successful in his job? apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice-cream companies. but this is what he says; we actually don't see him suffer that much: he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice-cream to the people in the town. ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real "sahlep" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy.in a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. in search of his stolen bike, ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. annoyed by the nagging of his wife, ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. one of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist of the town, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and with no real connection, jumps to the subject of global freezing. ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. his wife wakes up and prevents him. an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. according to him, ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. when he returns home, suddenly we see that his wife understood his value, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. meanwhile, the thief boys got sick eating too much ice-cream. they confess to the doctor that they stole ali's bike. ali forgives them and there comes the happy end.although the plot may look promising in a way, it's the story-telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. first, the director doesn't show much of an effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogs. and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. even ali's troubles are not convincing because we don't see it, we just understand it from his words. the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice-cream companies, but there is nothing in the film about big companies. we don't see their pressure enough. the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. and when his motorbike is found, it solves every problem: ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. not a real criticism of globalism.second, the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life, but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and "clever" but they are not clever jokes at all, they are just cheesy. maybe i'm wrong, maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor. but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars, or to have a political message! if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old villager woman saying "f**k you," then you may find this film funny.

i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar, my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it. and i really found what i expected; a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey, trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all. but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody, therefore film stays as average for all.whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours. to fit the short story in a full movie length, some scenes are added without a connection with the main story. these are mostly the ice-cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people (i.e. goat herdsman, old women etc.), and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs. the subject is mentioned as a universal problem: struggle of a local producer-tradesman against holding companies and monopoly, but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before. most of the readers will remember the "hero grocer against supermarket" from ferhan sensoy in 1980's. this was the correct story at correct time. shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now.except some gibbers due to local accent, the performance of cast is so successful. the leading role is played by turan ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too.on the other hand against limited budget, appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film. but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo-realists or worth to be oscar nominee.note: in the real life, normally the ice-cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of manda brand.

as someone who loves baseball history, especially the early 20th century in which cobb was a main figure, along with a ton of colorful characters, i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film. well, it wasn't a baseball film, which was disappointing. no, it was just a sportswriter's account of being with cobb in the ballplayer's later years while the two collaborated on a book. even at that, this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it.granted cobb was anything but a nice guy, an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you....and he was viscous, intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight. he was so hated his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title one year. nonetheless, this an over-the-top portrayal of the man. it makes him into something almost cartoon-like. watching and listening to an old man rant, rave and profane for two hours is entertainment? no, it isn't. some day, i'd love to see a real biopic of cobb showing him in his ballplaying days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, so be it, but the way they did it here with just a bitter, blasphemous old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.

cobb. it sucked. i learned nothing about the man i had not heard before. the performances were over the top. a scene where cobb and al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory. it's just plain stupid and unentertaining. the flashback sequences were terrible. and they used the same sequences over and over and over again. if i saw the same shot of cobb fighting with someone at a base one more time, i would have become physically ill. by watching this 'movie', we get to learn nothing of what it was like in cobb's era. we learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, other than that `they don't like him'. i thought when i sat down to view this film i would learn something about the era of baseball in which cobb played. instead, all i got to see was a retread of how cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. boy, what a great movie (sarcasm intended). cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate? who knows? who cares? no one will after viewing this piece of crap. if you decide to rent this film, make sure the fast forward button on your vcr is working, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. hopefully someday someone will make a good film about ty cobb. i liked this film about as much as the people in it liked cobb, which is to say - i hated it. now i know why i found it in the rent one get one free section of the video store. i think i will ask for my fifty cents back from the video clerk, since i can't get back the time i wasted watching this trash. oh well, what could i have possibly been thinking about a movie that would feature robert wuhl.

i don't know about the real cobb but i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers' aim was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation, not give us a true portrait of the man himself. in the movie, besides a few racist remarks, he's shown to be just another hard-nosed, cantakerous old coot (he's so full of life!) with a heart of gold(more or less). this is also the worst acting i've seen t.l.jones do(he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character). he just doesn't flesh out cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie. not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be ty cobb. robert wuhl didnt impress either. the "comedic" elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all. a bloody waste of time, it is

over all, it was a real good movie. though all the actors, besides jones, sucked. by the time i was half was through it i was really getting tired of seeing 'al'. only change i would have made to it would to have more flash backs, possibly with the real cobb.

ty cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. so of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump. now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards. but instead of focusing on these events, which i guess was simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichéd a clichéd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears. tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb, but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy. most stories about cobb are barely believable, but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary. robert wuhl, portraying the writer al stump, is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent. he sucks the life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own nagasaki. there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore (arliss doesn't count. it's barely a show). even the played out, inevitable "role reversal" of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that don't sound like a poor book on tape narration voice. for all the awful writing and bland film-making on display, there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible. a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobb's overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance. the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb. every slide, hit, and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound, and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player. it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor. it's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could have been. i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isn't, but to make such boring, neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical. i'm glad ron shelton's career has slid ever since.

i have to admit i was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box. so i popped it in the vcr and kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting for something good to happen. but of course, it never does. the makers of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch "saving private ryan". maybe they would learn something.

i like a good novelty song. no, i take that back. i love a good novelty song. i absolutely despise ggrobar on the other hand, and have from the first note i ever heard. when i found out someone had made a cartoon based on it, my head almost exploded. now that i have seen it because my kids begged me, i wish my head had exploded. it would have saved me from the excruciating misery that was this cr@pfest. first of all, making an hour long show based on a three minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. to stretch a song like this, which had to pad like crazy just to be that long, into an entire hour, is even more ludicrous. this was poorly written, cheaply animated, poorly acted...the list goes on and on. dear god, is this ever bad.

if we really want to get serious and find osama bin laden, then we should take this stinker down to gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. they'll be singing within minutes. of course, i'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the geneva convention in several ways. look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch tv at home. so take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little tv zombie. she got up and walked away after about ten minutes. that's how bad this is. you know, when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer, i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel. now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the medium.and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us...

trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. i don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. as for the song, it's mildly amusing. at least it was a decade ago. there are many christmas movies to watch. although i've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. whenever this comes on, i try to encourage my child to watch something else. one positive note, that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. that would have been encouraging, if anyone were watching.

wow, i swear this has never happened to me before. i only watched "golden temple amazons" yesterday and already i haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. that's how brilliant this movie is, i guess! by now i only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers  especially jess franco ones  and i still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. oh well after reading the other user-comments, some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before, namely "diamonds of the kilimanjaro" (and, yes, that one had an awesome dvd cover as well)."golden temple amazons" opens with a posse of hot white african amazons  i am aware of the contradiction but don't blame me  slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. she's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home. the rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. analía ivars, eva léon and the other nameless amazons are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. you better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves, as the rest of "golden temple amazons" is a boring and incompetent mess. there's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler, bits and pieces of national geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff. the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is utter pointless.

. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle. so no problems there for most males out there.i watched it as one of those bundled together package. forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. again, no complaints.the "fight scenes" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. on occasions when she has to fight, the "fighting" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. i am surprised no hair pulling is involved. it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the "combatants" that "i said, the one that draw first blood wins!" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting.the witch doctor kuku was a bloody blast. from being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, he became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance.beside liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. yeah, it is that kind of movie.watch the beautiful liane in her bouncy glory. despite the movie being more than 20 years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.

years ago, i used to watch bad movies deliberately. somehow i missed this one. no gesture rings true. no facial expression fits the scene or the action. i've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. at the final scene, i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.only one name in it i ever heard of - wilford brimley. he must've been very hungry to take this part.do not under any circumstances, watch this movie!!! you've been warned!!!

in my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. the point should be revealing the truth. this means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. this film is a failure in this regard. most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men off the street" expounding on the question of peace in the holy land. the wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all. for most of the interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as "what do you think of the wall?" - she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it. outside of one interviewee, the israeli general in charge of the wall's construction, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the wall's context (e.g. how and when the project began, whether it has been successful, which groups are for and which against the project, etc.)outside of the interviews, a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes, such as head-on shots of the wall, construction of the wall, and people getting off a bus. these shots take up far too much time, in my opinion. it's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of head-on filming of the wall (and only the wall) are excessive. clearly, these shots (accompanied by arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall.

this movie is so bad it's almost good. bad story, bad acting, bad music, you name it. o.k., who are the jokers that gave this flick a '10'?

i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. i guessed the film will be interesting.in fact isn't at all. not so much profound for a such subject. "eternity" never-ending life. experiences after death and "dejavu". the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. it's so naive. charming film but naive film. a must to avoid. the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best. normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie. the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store. it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn't so much profound about it.

i can't figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenth-rate, incoherent, pretentious, mind-numbing slop. he helped to write the alleged "script" himself, and he should be damn well ashamed of it. the film (i can't call it a "movie" because it barely moves at all) is rambling, embarrassingly pretentious drivel--sort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show, but worse. it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modern-day los angeles, with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive. if the bizarre casting (wilfrid brimley, frankie valli (!), kaye ballard and armand assante, among others) isn't enough to kill it, the stupefyingly inept direction, the washed-out photography (it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera), the almost complete lack of editing (scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence), and voight's embarrassing, apparently stream-of-consciousness "acting" are enough to bury it, which is exactly what should have been done with it. a jaw-dropping experience. avoid this dog at all costs.

this is the lamest, crappiest, idiotic, stupid movies i ever saw in my entire life... i can't believe there are directors who make these kinds of movies... this movie is a disgrace to horror genre... acting ??? oh! no !!! i couldn't bear... it's full of anguish... don't ever watch this movie... you'll feel like u are being tortured to eternity... please, save yourself from the horrible fate of watching this movie... if you really want to live, don't watch it... there are very good horror movies... this movie doesn't deserve tat single vote too... but, i hate to vote if i want to post my comments...

this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman deamon in it and that there is a portal to hell.in this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped of.i only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies.the acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy scheider from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10.

a rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a tv movie. plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later?), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an iq bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...it's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get roy scheider because his bills were due. if you're looking for an extremely formulaic, predictable film that might provide a few laughs, it might be worth watching. if not, then this one's not for you.

this sequel to the above - and the final entry in the "kharis" series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived (hell, we even get a singing barmaid/hostess!): peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films, and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; kurt katch, then, is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka: the latter, in the form of virginia christine (later a much-used character actress) gets her most substantial 'role' and, indeed, the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series. unfortunately, here too, chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka, as i've said; his mummy (to which he returned most often at universal - apart, naturally, from his signature role of the wolf man!) remains, without a doubt, his least memorable monster for the studio.

badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. it doesn't really get much worse. decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. occasional good one-liners.david is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. david is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an iq below sea level. a lacking script, along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing, make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show.david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher, haraldur, who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland. a severely lacking script doesn't offer david anything to base his opinion on. a couple of scenes showing haraldur doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work. the potentials of film as media, as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on, are not exploited.at first, david's connection with haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies.the plot of the film is fine, but then it is based on the book. this could have been a much better film. a good screenwriter could have made something of this material. sadly, that is not the case.the acting is generally good. pétur jóhann is excellent and credible as david. eggert þorleifsson doesn't get much to work with, but does his best with what little material he has. ingvar sigurðsson and michael imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright.overall opinion: what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang, becomes a boring, badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.

i did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. what kept it going were the good actors.but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. at best it is for teenagers, and i am sure many of them find the character of johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min. the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more, thou i tried to find a recovery point. maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. also, like in many movies, sure, good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue, or just turn down the script.

i found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie. there was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story. one did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work. for example despite losing their transfer cable, couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually, they fortunately found a spare on-board the aircraft complete with caribbeans. according to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated (i can't think why), according to daltry there battery operated drill would be unable to drill through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes hydraulic system located above the vault. as the plane has a closed hydraulic system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault (tension will they be able to drill through before fed's get there to check the false alarm), yet from the time the vault door closed and before the fed's had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a squire hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through. one can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn, however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to discuses what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending, they killed off the two hero's (if one can refer to crocks as hero's) ketchum & brooks one was shot and thrown out of a 747 at 10,000 feet the other wiliest sliding down the cable between the two planes the villain daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him, and letting him fall to his death. and yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation (however tenuous or implausible) have miraculously survived the full from 10.000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate scam to get the money. the only comment on there survival was to sophie that her brother is a bad shot. don't expect an oscar nomination for this one.

the only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew, were friends to the crew, or were obsessive fans of either lance henriksen or lorenzo lamas. i personally follow the "cult of lance", so i was disappointed to see that despite being the headliner, it's in name only. playing rich criminal newcastle, lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the movie. newcastle sets up a 747 heist which includes ketchum (lamas) and a bunch of forgettable characters. the biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-heist scenes were not all that bad. with the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking aviva gale, who times every line with the finesse of a grade school play actress, acting was decent all around, and none of the lines really made me cringe.but once the heist occurs, the movie falls asleep. not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film, but it's dragged out for far too long. this isn't a very deep movie, and you have to fill out your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring i nearly nodded off at two in the afternoon. one particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through. the movie's name is "rapid exchange", but the exchange is far from rapid - it's overlong and bloated to extremes. perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's only so much you can ask out of a straight-to-video movie airing of showtime extreme.thankfully, there are several laughs, intentional and unintentional (lorenzo lamas is seemingly a master of disguise, which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios), and lance returns in the film's end, albeit for a brief period of time. it's a bad movie, and i probably didn't have to tell you that myself, but it's far from the worst thing i've ever seen. i wouldn't put it too high on the list of henriksen films, since he's been in some real gems with greater screen time, and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins, but the best thing i can say for rapid exchange is that the last two films i watched before it were the mainstream hostage and the overrated, pretentious crash - and this was better than both.

as a fan of henriksen (i liked him in the "millennium" series) and of course lorenzo "renegade" lamas, i had expected at least something from this film. sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from microsoft flight simulator.the cinematography sucks as well. unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look. it works in hiphop-movies and jet li movies, but seems out of place in this flick.i would have liked this film 10 years ago. i was 11 then.

i absolutely hated this movie. even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera.also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son. that's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. i'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.

imagination must of slipped jim wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. i did enjoy seeing jay richardson and glori ann gilbert get eaten. gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). jerri manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy. at least we know the next plot giant snake man slays komodo before becoming daddy to a nest of eggs. jerri would be great as the mother cobra. sit back with a 6 pact or a couple of joints. it will ease the pain.

within the first 5 minutes of this movie i knew i was in for one of those "pick at the faults" kinda movie. the acting was terrible, the script was even worse. who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the komodo's themselves. with russian mig jets posing as u.s. air force jets, and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 - 60 rounds rapid fire without reloading is poor detail to any story. in one scene komodo are killing special forces troops at night, while in another they are explaining how the komodos and cobras are cold blooded and don't come out night!!!! also with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry, they were only average even for this low budget movie.all that being said, i did watch it to the end curious as to what other wonders bad film making could produce. shame shame shame, for producing such rot!!!this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor!!!

"scientists at a remote lab experiment on (insert scaly creature here) and create out of control monsters. in the meantime a crack military team/the scientist's daughter/bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters. one by one they're eaten, all during an "exciting" race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters..." the sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the sci-fi channel. i have to wonder just what is going on? sure... i like bimbos and hollywood-hunk wannabes be eaten by cgi critters as much as the next person... but where's the plot or originality? granted, there are times when sci-fi channel shines. battlestar galactica, if a bit dark, can be very good. writers have continued to pump life into the various stargate offerings, and the latest bbc import of doctor who is surprisingly good.even in the various "giant animal" movies on sci-fi, the animation seems to be getting better all the time. compare the kommodo in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant kommodo film on sci-fi.but goodness... how about a different plot? maybe some -different- giant critter? on a whim, i started searching around the internet. among the litter i found a few interesting stories which might appeal to sf fans and out of work russian cgi animators at once. i offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights. (the story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various sci-fi channel offerings).the story has subplot, ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible "did they really kill all the monsters???" moments, but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset.which is generally what science-fiction is supposed to do, no?

bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her? if she did get eaten wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart out? this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. how anti-climatic is that? maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something. he does join his sister in the komodo's belly - oh didn't mean to spoil it for you.

i was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. while not as bad as wynorski's "curse of the komodo", this still sucks...bad. wynorski uses the same island as in "curse of the komodo", as well as the same actors and house. the effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........i don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! as in "curse of the komodo", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! also....when i saw this part i laughed hysterically...a komanbra!!! (part man, komodo and cobra!). overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards. just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie....steer clear....to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating "it's almost over..it's almost over...". 0 out of 5.

jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs. cobra. no guesswork here. a giant cgi komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous cgi king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. the tree huggers get charter boat captain michael pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military. now all that's left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist's tiny, shapely daughter. the group runs into her at the old plantation lab, the monsters arrive, and the chase is on. if you watch enough wynorski/sci-fi channel flicks, you'll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies. acting is nonexistent, as is the plot. at the very least, you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo/dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up. the cobra just strikes and swallows. no imagination at all.

probably the worst creature feature ever,boa vs python was a million times better then this & that wasn't great either,bad acting,bad effects & guess what the dvd is one of those one with 3 hours of previews before the main menu.probably the least scary movie ever,no blood or violence,people are stupid and keep using pistols when they have no affect on these animals, the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that was pretty cool,i name of the island is just a rip off of jurassic park boring tiring & not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller

this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook "how to write a space disaster movie" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a "special visual effects" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects!and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i'm no nasa expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.

i'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knock-off. totally implausible (at least armageddon felt like a comic book! this felt like a bad high school film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an la freeway? come on. seriously. jerry, what were you thinking? and all the clichés: the pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with "go fever". and it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least make it good! fact and science were totally butchered for this. the space shuttle doesn't have fuel tanks in it's wings, and even if it did, it couldn't steer by shifting fuel between them (and neither could a dc-10).if you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism, and cheesy clichés, this one can't be beat!

when "deranged" was made the film-makers saw fit to turn ed gein into ezra cobb even though the resultant film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case. i presume that enough was fictionalised that they thought they should change names and such."ed gein - the butcher of plainfield" masquerades as a true story retelling of the gein case, but actually bears very little resemblance to the history. as a biopic type film it is a travesty. if ever a film needed names changing it is this one, far more so than "deranged". it is as close to the true crime story as "dirty harry" was to the true story of the zodiac killings.ok, so, that annoyance aside, how is it as a horror film? well, as a horror film, well, as a film generally, it is quite appalling. one of the worst films i have sat through in months. issues run thus: 1) kane hodder is quite astonishingly miscast as ed gein. utterly unsuitable in the part, hodder just lumbers through glowering menacingly. very bad.2) kane hodder is the best actor in the film! the rest of the cast are rather "amateur dramatics" and utterly unengaging. it is painful to witness some lines being delivered.3) the occasional efforts of stylish film-making seem to come from "the big book of moody cinematography cliché". you've seen it all before, better executed. aside from the efforts at style, the rest of the film-making is largely inept: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are overlong pointless shots holding back the pace...which leads me to...4) it seems to go on forever. it is under 90 minutes in length, but sitting through it is an ordeal. you'd swear it ran two and a half hours.5) ed gein almost seems secondary. mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff. said deputy is played by an abysmal actor upon whose shoulders no film should rest.is anything good about it? well, the gore fx are very good. some convincing wounds are in display and the make-up is generally excellent. none of this, however, makes up for the massive failings of the film.it doesn't even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not enjoyably bad, not "so bad it's good", just genuinely bad. a film to avoid and despise.

i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't. let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half. (spoiler alert) the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he reappears in thunderdome it looks like the two had never met. whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know. however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film. 2 out of 10. doesn't get a 1/10 because of the thunderdome fight.

even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise, and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings i might of had for the character of max, i just can't bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it.gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max rockatansky, gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world, and more crucially, gone is director george miller's passion for the franchise. the dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third {and thankfully last} instalment. sure the stunts are spot on {to be expected by now}, and of course miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since the road warrior's crowning glory of the petrol tanker pursuit is replicated here, only he uses a train instead!!.it's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s; but when viewing the three films together now, thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. and the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. i give the film 3/10 purely for one real good thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least. but this is the third time i have tried to like this film, and as glutton for punishment as i undoubtedly am, i wont be trying again, ever.

ever since he played a goon in lone wolf mcquade, actor/stuntman kane hodder has been busy. his film, hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but he still makes a couple of more films every year. he should have skipped this one.hodder seems to be the king of the slashers. he has played jason voorhees from 1988's friday the 13th part vii: the new blood (1988) to jason x (2001). he is working on a new film that appears to be a halloween remake. he is very much what i would call the serial killer type with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood.however, there wasn't much blood in this movie and very little action occurred on camera. it felt as if i was watching an episode of real law enforcement on a&e.i won't put the blame entirely on hodder's shoulders, as the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either.michael berryman (the hills have eyes, the devil's rejects) just ran his mouth until gein shut him up. adrienne frantz ("the bold and the beautiful") was cute. veteran actress ("three's company") and penthouse pet, priscilla barnes did a credible job. i am sure there are other horror favorites, but they all just seemed to run through their roles.

intelligent summary, isn't it?if mad max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, the road warrior. so, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!such a huge disappointment beyond thunderdome was! it's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between metropolis and the time machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction. add the obnoxious tina turner and the no good story-line of the people waiting for a plane, and this is just one huge stinker.maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing), because this just isn't right.3/10.

like the previous two 'mad max' films, 'mad max beyond thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. mad max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. this is generally a warped film with peter pan references and tina turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. i got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. i did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film. it's too weird for me, and it was much too dull.

every time i've seen this movie i get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because sam raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. this movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably. the crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for 'awful.' watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison essay--"everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it." i should be able to give this movie something around a -5.

my reasoning behind viewing this film (despite the fact that it was free), was more or less out of curiosity... slight, slight curiosity... i wasn't all that familiar with this straight-to-video "biographical" account of mr. gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon kane hodder in the starring role. my emotions turned from not just curiosity, but now a glimmer of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of gein would turn out. also in the credits (among some grim photos of ed's crimes) was michael berryman and priscilla barns. "okay", i thought to myself... "this may be mildly amusing". as the movie started and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as i call it, "micro-hope") for this movie faded entirely and i was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation as i died a little inside from watching this dung heap. hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, inaccurately puts that into play here - turning eddie gein from a mild-mannered recluse, to a hulking, full-blown killing machine. he lurks by night, killing cemetery caretakers, his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls, leaving plainfield in a panic as the local sheriff's department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least. the deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside (or that could have just been the cyanide pill i ingested halfway through this turkey). i'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with. there is already such an abundance of films pertaining to gein's story that, unless the "ed gein snuff footage" is discovered, i don't want to see anymore of these on the shelves. if you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out 2001's "ed gein (aka in the light of the moon)".

i own a vacation lake home not far from plainfield, wi. ten minutes from the gein property to be exact. i've seen his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging, and i've shopped at the hardware store that was formerly owned by the worden family. while visiting relatives in california, we decided to rent this movie. it was disgusting. the true story of ed gein is so disturbing and creepy, why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me. the actor playing ed is a very large man, ed was a very small, meek, and shy man. that is part of what makes his story so frightening. he did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it. you won't break much of a sweat digging a hole. they didn't have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler, just do your research. and if the writing wasn't bad enough - there are no mountains in wisconsin, and i'm pretty certain that 911 was not available in 1957.

this movie is essentially a "how-to" on how to be a well-connected pedophile. i'm amazed that so many people-- especially other gay men-- have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in jail, doing time for child abuse. poor peter johnson. weber took this poor, naive (although incredibly handsome) teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the midwest, brought him to live in his home, and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them full-frontal nudes, all through johnson's teenage years. that ain't art. it's child abuse. and what's worse, weber made lots of money off of it, and poor johnson is going to have serious "issues" the rest of his life. weber's lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy, as are his ramblings about famous (and not so famous) people he's known, as he tries to complete johnson's "education." creepy, and then just plain boring. the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. but i can't help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on "chop suey" (weber's nickname for johnson) himself.

there are interesting pieces here of and about bruce weber's likes and dislikes. maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography, i would have felt more satisfied. instead, i spent $8 at a film festival on it. for an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about bruce weber, other than he likes to look at photographs, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenage boys, and listen to jazz. the director of "crumb" would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film.

if you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. it did for me, at least. i'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "fish" "swimming". the sound which accompanies those shots is great too.one last note: william katt is actually a pretty decent actor. i hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as "the greatest american hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since. he seemed kind of depressed in this movie. somebody give him a fun job on a good show, or something.

this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life! the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his piranhas any since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from piranha (1978), up from the depths (1979) and humanoids from the deep (1979). it makes piranha ii: the spawning look like it belongs on the american film institute list.

i think that this was one of the most trite films ever made. no redeeming features at all. even my 12-year-old son said it was laughable. may be a good candidate for the next generation of "mystery science theatre."

i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of '95 "piranha" back-to-back with joe dante's '78 original. i did the same last week with "the omen". curiously enough, watching the remake right after the '76 original, really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons.but this approach sort of backfired on the '95 piranha version. it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture. basically, the '95 version is more or less the exact same film, as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene-by-scene (only barabara steele's character and the military intervention were written out of it). but the cinematography wasn't as good. the acting was worse too. especially alexandra paul (playing heather menzies' character) showed me again what a horrible actress she is. bradford dillman (from the '78 version) had his charlton heston way of acting going, which was amusing, while in the '95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt. so i didn't mind him, really. but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen ("return of the living dead", parts 1 & 2) in a cameo. john carl buechler's make-up effects aren't as neat as rob bottin's. the musical score had some ring to it, but pino donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re-watched the original as part of this double bill.since scott p. levy's remake does follow dante's original, i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through, though it's lacking the wit dante's original had. but what really made me not like levy's version very much, is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re-used during the piranha attack scenes. i never like it when filmmakers do this (and i'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons). i mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to come up with newly shot material, then for pete's sake, don't do a frickin' remake. but roger corman produced this (cheaper) remake, so i guess i shouldn't be all that surprised about the re-use of footage.if you do decide to watch "piranha", then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. you might enjoy this remake a little more then. and oh yes, that cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film, as to be expected. but what's worse, there also isn't any female nudity in this one (the original really had quite some titty-shots going for it, and that blonde girl from the opening-scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans!). figures, as this '95 version was made for tv.

well, i thought the movie was blah 1/10.anyways the best part is the first 5 minutes of the film with the nerd's or whatever girlfriend, this is the part u guys watch out for tho she had big hooters, i thought is that really a random actor? heck no, it wasn't it was actually a model by the name of larissa mccomas but u already knew thatso, that made sense but that was about it rest of the film (that i saw anyway) didn't care 4, and didn't bother watching the rest of it that'sall i needed to c to be satisfied so 2 those of u that just care for that well there u go enjoy

why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a simpson's halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice. but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing. the best bit? its only about an hour and a half, thank god.

i realize why people hate this film. and, i hated blair witch project,so go figure? this is about as staged as it gets & yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real.i really liked the madame lalaurie storyline though it's more than likely made up. but, the main reason i like this film, is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking & kidnapping them,i get chill-bumps every time & have to look behind me as it feels like something's there with me.i know it's my imagination, but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas & dvd's doesn't give me goosebumps,so that makes this a creepy delight.not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it & not for gorehounds as with a pg-13 rating there is no gore. and, the females are very annoying!you'll wish the ghosts would take them off & experiment on them before it's all said & done. ** out of *****.

okay they tell you it's real. they don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - it's not real in the way you were hoping for. the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage. so i'm sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up...and they were just told to ad-lib around it all.*************'major spoilers'**************** *****************************************okay, it's so lame. every item, spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare, is magically stumbled upon by these people. let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember:1) less than 2 minutes of entering the house, they turn a light switch on - the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy.2) they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife* in it, while exploring the cellar.3) they hear a noise in an armoire, so they open the door slowly - bam - a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking.4) then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall, so let's stick our hand in...wow, they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape.5) let's go to the attic, uh-oh it feels 'heavy' up here....boom - a chair flies across the room.6) time to eat. oh no ! the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich ! lol !....ridiculous.7) let's get out the ouija board...oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board. that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it ? (they find out a ghost there is named charles)8) wait ! what was that noise in the chimney...clink - oh my shackles fell out "i think she* kept people up here".9) now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft...oh, what's this she sees something...and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is. swish - it falls off straight at her. (perfect camera shot) she moves just in time. it was more chain.10) now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms - wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now...okay:chick #1: wow, suddenly her room is shaking...but no one elses does.dude #1: actually says to himself "charles, is that you charles...it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles". well guess what, he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor. another lucky camera shot.chick #2: hears things..try to communicate ...and is standing there getting abrasions or something.dude #2: he was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter....i don't remember what else.11) dude #2 runs, gets chick #2...they hear chick and dude #1 screaming...they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table.(*) they leave. cut to black. final text tell us they escaped safely, were treated for minor cuts. they have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named "charles".*************'major spoilers'**************** ******************over********************okay, when i first heard this movie was being made, i couldn't wait. i thought it was going to be real. real, real. - and more professional, with more professional type people. i love the idea of this type of thing, i'd love to see real haunting footage. before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online. they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were.. time passed i forgot about the film....then i realized it was never released at theaters. so i found out it went straight to video, rented it....found that every brutal review was completely true. it's too bad, i really wanted this to be good.random thought: the house didn't seem to have tvs, radios..kitchen appliances that i recall...which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. especially the house is truly known for being haunted...im pretty sure no one lives there. but it looks so clean and tidy...and what was a cat doing there ? the property does not have near by neighbors....all-in-all, you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it...or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you. (you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film...or real film)random thought: i believe the producer says "the 'footage' you see is real". well technically it is real footage isn't it ? real footage of fake hauntings ? maybe that was his loop hole.i give this this movie one star - strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame lalaurie. a real new orleans story.the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning. he was obviously actually real...or a good actor.

i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story. the majority of the scenes looked fake to me. for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it. while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it. it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect. this movie was not realistic at all. it's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the "st. francisville experiment" took place. i believe that the house may be haunted, but not on the night this movie was filmed! the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement. paul and madison found them and rescued them! i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st. francisville experiment movie again. as i said, if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more. your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project (even though this is not a true story either)!!!

the characters are annoying, immature, and flaky....madison being the most annoying of all. ooh...a cold spot! such a dire threat! any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! to make a long story short, this movie is boring. seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy, but that's about as intriguing as it gets. i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again. if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this isn't it! the only good part of the whole thing was "the roach scene" and, by the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the roach!

i just saw this movie and all i can say is, where are the drive in's these days. this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. interesting to see melanie griffith so young and anne lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress. in fact, there is not much acting going on in this movie at all. it's sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 dodge charger jumping over stuff in the woods. but there is a mecrury comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one!

the video box for 'joyride' says "starring second generation superstars", and one can't help but feel sad. granted, melanie griffith has gone on to bigger and better things...but who cares about the rest of the cast? so with that being the pathetic attention grabber on the box i was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking i would be in the land of 'so-bad-they're-good 70's films' eh, not so much. while so many aimless 70's youth films (or plain ol' 70's films for that matter) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, 'joyride' doesn't even try. it's just aimless. it is devoid of any interest whatsoever. each character is so poorly conceived that it's no wonder these actors look so listless.in a nutshell the movie is about three 20-somethings who go to alaska to start a business, but instead get robbed and then have to find work. they get beat up, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. it's all very typical but on top of that it's executed in the most mundane way possible. there are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all.but if you're a fan of melanie griffith's breasts - then this is a must-see. that's still not enough to get this above the lowest rating i can give.best line: "jesus, everything is biology with you." * out of ****

a pre-nerd robert carradine, a pre-automan desi arnaz jr., and an almost pre-pubescent melanie griffith take to the road and head for alaska with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy salmon fishers. well, their dream is about as exciting as this lackluster youth road movie. they aren't particularly interesting, and the film doesn't exactly have much of a point, beyond `we got together the spawn of some famous people and made a low budget film about their misadventures.' out of the cannon of 60's and 70's road films and rebel youth films, this one is mediocre, under developed, uninvolving characters, not much wit, not much freshness to the story, which is as bland as the films muddy landscape.but, for those who care- they head to alaska, and apparently alaska was like the wild west in the 70's because everyone carries a gun and is rough and tumble. robert carradine says charming things like `i hope we can find a shower, my nuts sure itch.' (and he's the one with melanie griffith!) they are quickly robbed and forced to take jobs, and the local bigwig, their employer, puts the moves on melanie and eventually fires desi for not being corrupt. that's when they aren't smart and do not leave town, opting instead to eat dog food or go hungry, get beat up by the guys goons, and then take a joyride in the bigwigs car. the final half of the film abandons the evil bigwig as the trio commit a robbery, go on the run, and hatch a kidnapping scheme, and so forth. the film just sort of ends, annoyingly and ambiguously, but seeing as how they didn't bother to have much character development and story in the first place, its rather appropriate. worth a look if you are really into low budget 70's fare, but ultimately pretty forgettable.

ken burns' "baseball" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. there's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. it's clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his "nine inning" concept. it's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! this is syrupy, mawkish drivel. billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he's sold us before. ken burns uses the national anthem as the series' theme song, and manages to play "take me out to the ballgame" so many times you might vomit. we get it, dude.clearly burns is a neo-hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as kenny is today. for shame! he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times! burns falls head over heels in love with buck o'neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o'neil waxes poetic about his playing days. nonsense...burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. "baseball" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as americana. its clear that burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, mr. burns? there's no crying in baseball.

well, that's what this should have been called, anyway. mainly, due the the ridiculous, ham-fisted use of what can barely be called symbolism by the director. it would not have surprised me to find out that this was a) one of lea pool's earliest efforts, and b) at least semi-autobiographical. turns out a is wrong, although i don;t know about b. i will bet she attended boarding school, though, and had a rather terrible same-sex relationship of some kind. this is the message that was beat down our throats by this film, and the short film which preceded it, the name of which i no longer recall.at any rate, the character development was clumsy (who introduces herself by saying what her name means? nobody.) the symbols were about as subtle as an all-glass elevator full of teen-age girls losing a cable and plummeting eighty stories. all over a loudspeaker. honestly, the cry of a falcon when perabo declared she was a raptor and leapt off the table? that was ridiculous to the point of parody. and it was only one of far too many symbols meant to show even the dumbest of viewers what her point was. and that was that she had a crappy childhood and feels the need to make movies about it, ala vincent gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, ala all of us who get on with our lives. there was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing moving about this film. it was poorly enacted trash, and the actors could not save the brett ratneresque over the top "hey this is my point in this movie" use of film techniques, writing, and acting. sorry, but it was terrible.

if you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then i can imagine giving it a good rating... but i cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. yes, it's also bad the way victoria treated paulie, but guess what. that's life. isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life? or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children? secondly, when mary's father didn't show up for the dinner, and paulie helped mary release her anger, that mary even said she wished he were dead... somehow i don't think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger.

the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible.they had a nice budget, though so do many films; they made it look slick and pretty, and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film... and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools, (you know, the place all lesbian love lives and dies). this is a theme that has been done again and again and again in film, but something that viewers-if one uses this voting forum as a clue- cannot seem to get enough of.every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through. the lead characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, genius, rebel lesbian tough girl (well, they took a super pretty femme like piper perabo and tried to rough her up, but it didn't stick much) seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her. watching them every step of the way is character 3, a dopey, well-meaning, wide-eyed, good girl observer. i say 'every step' because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest, most inane monologues.her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk. "hearing them (make love) with their noises was um, you know, like, well... okay!" she says about her 2 wanton roommates, who roll around in the bed next to her.later she asks graham greene- the accomplished native american actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener (!) "is it wrong to care what people think?"sorry, but is she a teenager, or is she age 7?granted, piper perabo (as polly the tortured dyke) & others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. she would do well in a decent project, so this is in no way a criticism of the acting.but this story is shameless in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character. they couldn't stop with her (polly) being an angry, crazy-passionate, secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher. oh but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of "gabbing"."that's a word they (males) use against us (women)!" she says, stomping out of the classroom.is this all the writer could come up with? or maybe we should ask: why stop there? poole and co. went on and made polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods.cue the slow motion, sci-fi, xena atmosphere!then we have her writing to her birth mother... (most lesbians are love-starved orphans, in case you were in the dark).then we have two teachers (one uptight, one a zany type with loose neck ties) who hover around all of the action (the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers)... and give dark child/ seductress/bird girl tense looks. hmmmm. i wonder if something well, you know... um, funny is happening between these two teachers??????there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. heartbreak happens, but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock.i cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end, but if you are not laughing, i can only guess you are crying. and not for the right reason. and i don't mean the wimpy make out scenes.

if you find the hopelessly amateurish acting, the uninteresting story, the fake blood and all the mindless shooting bearable, then you may actually have a fairly good time watching this trashy, low-rent exploitation film. you might also want to check out a pretty good catfighting sequence that's offered, although it's not good enough to make the rest of the movie worth sitting through.

pam grier is the super soul sister of the 1970's, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. i can safely say that black mama, white mama may be the worst pam grier movie i've ever seen.grier is lee and margaret markov is karen; they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. chained to each other, the film becomes the defiant ones for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (filipino sleaze star vic diaz) wants lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent sid haig) searches for the two girls; and karen's revolutionary friends search for her. the film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been men chasing women. grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in any of the many (overlong) action scenes. markov is excellent as karen and grier is ok as lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. one interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and his chief to drop their pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by his whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem.black mama, white mama starts out great as a women-in-prison film complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, then completely switches to a chase film. if director eddie romero (famous for directing filipino horror films) had just stuck with the wip theme, he would have been fine. instead, bmwm gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a 90-minute film for it to end like this! another problem: where is the film supposed to be set? while some of the accents are hispanic and cities have spanish names (los robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously asian! hmmm... recommended only for die-hard grier fans, who even then will be disappointed.

the title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. it's a grade-c howler but not as blatantly funny as i was hoping. directed by exploitation film specialist eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan demme (long before directing "silence of the lambs" and "philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. playing hooker and small-time drug dealer lee daniels, blaxploitation superstar pam grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten margaret markov is the other half, karen brent, an unlikely patty hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as lee and karen are pitted against each other. of course, they escape but shackled together a la "the defiant ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for lee who stole $40k from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of filipino women, a dog wears karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). there is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. sadly, grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while markov is an amazonian blonde whom i am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed sid haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. the 2003 dvd contains only the original trailer as an extra.

this is one heck of a sleazy film. like so many "women in chains" films, this one is chock full of lesbianism. however, unlike most prior films, which strongly implied this, black mama, white mama shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard leers at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates. for the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft-core pornographic film--sort of like girls gone wild goes to prison! it's also a bad rip-off of the defiant ones, though in this case it's two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they escape. whereas the original film is considered a classic, this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. that's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap--cheap thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting.pam grier is the "black inmate with an attitude"--a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island. margaret markov is a revolutionary. when they escape, they both can't stand each other and have opposite goals. however, since it is cliché-driven, there's really no surprise in how the film ends--with their both becoming (gag me) friends.

the plot for black mama white mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the phillipines. one black, and one white. these two women, are thrown together in the prison. pam grier is lee daniels lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the phillipines and assume a better life. margaret markov plays karen brent, a white women from a privileged background, who is also a revolutionary. karen has joined a group of revolutionaries, determined to change the corrupt phillipino political system. she's captured by phillipino authorities, and held as a political prisoner.the story-line takes-off, when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together. the two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist. as they flee, they also fight with each other, because they have different goals to pursue. naturally, they hate being chained together. but they also realize that they must put aside their differences, to help each other survive while they evade capture.if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage, it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same, as well as their location in the phillipines. roger corman, has always had a consistent stable of actors, that he used in all of his 70s b movies. besides pam grier, sid haig, roberta collins, claudia jennings, betty anne rees, and william smith, were also among the many actors that were frequently cast, in corman's aip films.like the big bird cage, black mama white mama, relies on too much gory violence to be palatable. pam grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film, and shows her competence as a female action heroine. margaret markov is less effect, in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen. she just seems to fragile and well-coiffed, to be a dedicated political guerrilla. except for sid haig, as the colorful ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable.this film has little entertainment value, unless excessive, heinous acts of violence are your thing. only the performances by pam grier and sig haig, make this film worth watching.

and you'd be right. black mama, white mama, also known as 'women in chains,' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b-movie that the premise suggests. pam grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women, and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximum-security prison. it's not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line 'strip 'em and get 'em wet,' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman's fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like. the prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it's a girls gone wild shoot, then they all hang out together in their dorm, openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape. i've never been to prison myself, but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about, prisoners or guards or otherwise. the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans (and no pants. go figure) that say prison on the back. must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that can't afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms.and as is to be expected, a prison that can't afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other.the conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that lee daniels (pam grier) spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison. i won't go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck, and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons. karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner, and the cops are after both of them all the while.(spoilers) so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to revolutionize life as they know it. meanwhile, karen just wants to get off the island, something she's been trying to do for years, and isn't it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals. so we get this odd couple pairing and, since they are an odd couple, it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end.in a movie with so many conflicting interests, especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie. not about to leave anyone unsatisfied, they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie, where everyone shoots machine guns at each other, killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat. nice. even better, at the end of the movie, after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place, the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful, awful special effects, and we learn that he will be a major before dinner. not a bad way to end the movie, the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit, but here is the last line in the film  'it's better to win, isn't it?' is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major? because he figured that out???

some of the films produced by roger corman's new world film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of b-movie, where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of freeing influence on the writers and directors  such classic drive-in films as "deathrace 2000", "hollywood boulevard", "grand theft auto" and "caged heat" emerged from this environment. unfortunately, his former confederates at american international pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s, particularly in the absence of jim nicholson, and they often produced second rate imitations of corman's films, sometimes featuring his self-made stars. "black mama, white mama" is one of those films. it's basically a cheaper imitation of "the big doll house with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things. yes, this is a john ashley co-production (yes, the same john ashley who was the hilarious elvis wanna-be in "how to make a monster" and paired up with debbie walley in "beach blanket bingo") with all the signature marks of his productions  women's prisons where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 lead characters including the inmates and the guards are filipino actors in mostly non-speaking roles, where we see supermodel-type women taking on the roles of revolutionary militants, and where the primary joy of the film is derived through rudimentary s&m exploitation.the print i saw most recently was horribly light-damaged (good ole will viharo described it as "yellow mama, yellow mama"), but i think even in the best conditions the photography and directing are extremely routine. there's also very little visual value here corman must not have had very much to do with the film itself because he was always canny enough to at least give his films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive. this film doesn't look impressive, it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack, and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a shred of talent. the only remotely interesting performances come from pam grier as a feisty whore out to escape the life, filipino actor dindo fernando as her grotesquely self-indulgent pimp, and sid haig as a cowboy styled mercenary. the story places grier and co-star margaret markov in a low budget female version of "the defiant ones", but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities afforded by that premise. it's basically just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while they're trying to escape the prison together. this is all in the spirit of good fun, but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation because there's a certain edge and rawness that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under this director's hand with a kind of yawning predictability.so the film will have little value for fans of hard-core exploitation value  at least in the version i saw it's no more explicit than "faster pussycat, kill! kill!" from over a decade earlier, and far less interesting visually and thematically. for those who just enjoy getting a laugh out of "so bad it's good" films, this one might provide some fun but it's not in the upper tier. people would be more advised to seek out "caged heat" or some of the others that revel in their own brutality to the point that it becomes camp; this one is more similar to less ambitious efforts like cirio santiago's "the muthers". sadly, the best thing about this particular film is the title and the presence of pam grier, who was better in other films around the same time (particularly jack hill's "coffy"). this film perhaps illustrates a midway point in miss grier's journey from corman secretary to b-movie queen-for-a-day, but other than its historical "significance" as such it will have little value even to grier's big fans because she is given very little to work with here.worth skipping, unless of course you get to see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like i did. and even then its value is questionable.

imagine an exploitive remake of the defiant ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. set the story on some caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. and have the black woman be from huggy bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down patty hearst and you've got black mama, white mama.in those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. all the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed in this one. even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake pam grier and margaret markov for sidney poitier and tony curtis. all right, halle berry and jamie lee curtis.margaret and pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look lasciviously at the new fish arriving. margaret is a rich girl from the state who took up 'the revolution', whilst pam's your basic high priced call girl who's been servicing the local drug kingpin and grew tired of it and tried to leave the island.margaret's fellow revolutionaries ambush the bus transporting them from the women's prison to town, but they get lost in the escape. both have their different agendas, but like sid and tony they can't quite agree on whose agenda comes first. makes for some interesting times as the police, the drug dealers, and the revolutionaries are all looking for these two illfated chain buddies.just so you don't get any wrong ideas the head of the revolutionaries and markov's kanoodling partner is named ernesto played by filipino actor zaldy zshornack. the whole mess was shot in the phillipines who were getting their own film industry started.nice location photography in the phillipines is all that black mama, white mam has to recommend it. but if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks, this is one for you.

let's just say that it might be the worst movie i've ever seen. on the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling reservoir dogs. i fell for it hook, line, and sinker. this is just a warning message to anyone who might read this. it's not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at.

this has got to be one of absolute worst movies i've ever seen in my life. the writing and acting are just pathetic. it ranks right up there with uncle sam on the all time worst movies ever made. however, when i see crap like this able to make it to video, it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because i know i could do a better job than what the makers of killers did.

this film is an embarrassment. nothing works on any level. the direction, screenplay, acting , and editing work together to repel your eyes from the screen. everything is inappropriate and incoherent. at first you can sit there with and groan, wince, and laugh at it, but very shortly the whole effort of watching just becomes too ponderous.

...but you can see it from here.i definitely don't understand why anyone would recommend this movie. not a bit of plot, not suspenseful, not well-made. no point to having made it, really.completely forgettable in ever way.

much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to r dogs made on the dvd cover. forget about all of that... this film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. how can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? there is no plot, none. i couldn't believe that i spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that i had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential. the only thing i do really remember was that, unbelievably, one of the annoying main characters was supposedly offed with a bullet to the head... and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive. wow. and looky dere, killers has a sequel. double wow.true story -- i actually was in so much denial that i had wasted my money and life force on this rental that i kept the videotape for what must've been six months. i kept telling myself that it never actually happened. the video on top of the tv was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-loathing. after someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that i needed to get a grip, i decided that i couldn't just leave it there. i thought, "how many others have i denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by hoarding killers all to myself?" i had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came. so, as i imagine most of the populous of imdb would do in a similar situation, i mustered up some major courage and drove to the video store... at 2am. after making sure that no one was around, i got out of my car (still running of course), slipped the movie into the drop box slot, and booked the hell out of there never to return.i guess i expected that some goons from hollywood video corporate would come looking for me (the bill must've racked up to something like $1,238.67 by that time) so i moved away from the area. however, coincidently, much like the killers storyline, nothing ever happened.

i'd liked the takashi miike films i'd seen so far, but i found this pretty disappointing. i'd bought it, but i won't be keeping it.i saw it on the adness dvd, which has just two episodes. in the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. you can tell that from the dvd box. in the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by tv static. had you not seen the dvd box, the viewer wouldn't know what people were looking at until later a young cop produced a small model of the body. oddly, there is also a flash frame later on of the woman's head and it is not censored. apart from this, i'm not really sure what was going on. some women get phone calls, and a sketchy animated character cavorts around when that happens. an animated character also appears on tv screens sometimes. it's unclear if anybody sees it.in the second episode, pregnant women are being found cut open and their babies are missing. again, a cop produces a model of what the corpses are like, which is helpful since again the actual body is censored. there is also a natural birth in the movie, but oddly even that baby and the umbilical cord are censored! according the the dvd box, uncensored versions were not kept when this was originally made. perhaps even if they had, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they didn't bother actually showing anything...? not sure.if i hear the later episodes are better, maybe i'll look for them. as it is, i won't bother.

ah animorphs. i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation, i was very excited.boy what a let down the final product was. i think for me, this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic.so what was wrong with the series? let me count the ways: 1. the characters were horrifically miscast. in the books, the animorphs were somewhere between 12-14, the television cast were at least 18. i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos.2. horrific acting/bad writing. i dunno which was to blame so i'm lumping into the lumpy mass that it was. perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because marco - not funny. in fact, i don't remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few. the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worst.3. my lord they were stingy with the budget. the final result of the andalites alone should have convinced viacom to pull the plug...their heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmet.4. back to the cast - rachel by far was the biggest let down, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent in the tv series was "scarecrow". also, i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot".5. one of the worst opening titles ever. did the music have to be that obvious? 6. answering question 6, "yes" because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn't the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap-rock rip-off or whatever the hell that was.since then, there have been bigger let downs (iraq, 2004) but in case i haven't made myself clear - this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from.

...and in this series, i've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. remember my friend marco, who got all the good lines in the books? well, in this series his one-liners put mr. freeze to shame. remember our uber-evil nemesis visser three? he's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. remember rachel, "xena, the warrior princess", and cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? they've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for tv. remember the awesome extra-terrestial ax, who was cool, intelligent, and really, really liked cinnamon buns? in this series he's the token alien with an extremely annoying voice. remember the witty banter our team had in the books? in this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it's obvious the writers were pandering to the lowest common denominator.so forget everything you thought you knew about the animorphs! it was cassie who became allergic to morphing, not rachel, thought-speak is *supposed* to echo, and visser three and ax, rarely, if ever, appeared as andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). i'm not crazy. and i'm not lying. the jerks are all around us. and if you're unlucky, one of them might adapt one of your favourite books, or series, or graphic novels, into a really awful tv show. you've been warned."finally... television worth watching." ~ (the very bald) visser three(r#91)

"my blue heaven" is boring. the plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. the leads, betty grable and dan dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. david wayne and jane wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.there's really only one reason to watch "my blue heaven". one reason...one star: mitzi gaynor, in her film debut. her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? her pert and promising screen personality, her feline beauty, and her exceptional charisma shine through gloriously and make these minutes the most watchable, memorable, and exciting moments in the entire film. if you would value an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise, then check out miss mitzi gaynor in "my blue heaven."incidentally, i scorn (and would urge you to avoid) drew casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive dvd commentary for this film. wordy, digressive, unduly fastidious, frequently ill-timed with what is playing on the screen, and galloping throughout with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.

the shanghai cobra starts out like gangbusters, with a rain soaked diner scene straight out of shack out on 101 or gun crazy (the first one). unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful mantan moreland. it's as if director karlson blew half his budget in the first five minutes, just getting the set up the way he wanted it. watch the beginning and think about the phenix city story.

admittedly, i am not a fan of the monogram chan films. . the plot, involving radium theft from a bank vault, is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced. mantan moreland and benson fong (as no. 3 son tommy) provide some laughs as usual. but otherwise there isn't much here. great title that is wasted.

uwe boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, i'm guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. it really stinks. clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed. the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i've ever seen. this isn't that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film. i'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable.

i don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies, but seriously. there isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. that seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. this butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill, and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen.wow, 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you, sorry

i am deeply disturbed by some posts i am reading on the message boards for this movie, people saying it is actually a good movie! just because this movie is uwe boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all, no way in hell! far cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. this is boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot, and hey, mr. boll succeeds in doing that. house of the dead, alone in the dark, and bloodrayne, all horror games adapted into movies by boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). far cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. til schweiger is quite good as jack carver, and emmanuelle vaugier is a strong female lead. the usually great udo kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering boll was behind the camera.unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad cgi, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. oh, and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene. not only have the two only known each other for six hours, but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. he already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.anyway, to summarise, this is a bad movie. it is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. one could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it, but i'd personally say watch a classic action film like die hard or predator and stay away from this derivative mess.1½/5

there is only one reason this movie is watchable. till schweiger. he is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. uwe boll please take up another career. the special effects and action are acceptable. all other aspects were very disappointing. all i can say is that kevin smith (an evening with...) talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed. uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. if you two ever want to know how it is done go see andrzej bartkowiak. doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom. it doesn't seem like anyone at ubisoft was even near this production.

one of bolls better attempts. just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. the main difference between bloodrayne and farcry really is that the story from farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas bloodrayne had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up.the action in this movie is actually fairly good. occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.acting wise it was pretty decent. most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for fps carnage. would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesn't have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.why boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots i don't know but he does. and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.

mr. "uwe fail" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. poor acting; poor directing; awful adaptation; i mean, far-cry game was awesome, its like a true fps game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of "point and shoot". in the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. well we had some of the "point and shoot" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another "uwe fail" movie you will understand. if you don't believe me, go to the website "petition online" and do a check for one named "stop uwe bowl".that movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop him for once.don't waste your time.

i was one "chosen" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game "far cry", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (very horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's "the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail". there were so horrible mistakes in this film (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 at day-time, and one somehow at night.....)so lets come to "far cry". if you expect cool action, forget it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action. if you expect a cool story, forget it. orientating by the not-so-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. the actors' playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny, but in a no-good way.i had the chance to see this movie for free. so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash. its one of my favorised flicks for the bottom 100.!!!!

glenn ford, a new york boy who has been saving his cash, thumbs and hobos his way to the arizona ranch he has bought, where he hopes to find heaven with a barbed wire fence.a film with a dalton trumbo script and story, directed by villain extraordinaire ricardo cortez, and starring the frequently twitchy glenn ford and the restless richard conte just shouldn't be so bloody nice. though the system -- mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men -- is as awful as one might expect from the leftish mr. trumbo, every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea. it doesn't help that the heroine -- a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing franco's spain -- is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting.so why watch? richard conte, in his first role, already has his persona and a pretty good part. and there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing. (did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian worker's mission? all that was missing was a portrait of a beaming joe stalin!) also, this is glenn ford's first substantive role (though his performance isn't good).why not watch? essentially, the movie offers an unconvincing vision, is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible, and the two leads have made much better movies. also, the strengths of dalton trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence. instead, we get a film that the coen brothers barton fink could have written in a flash (and avoided that hellish bout with writer's block).

a total and utter travesty of a movie.'dark power'is the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release.the script,direction,acting and action sequence's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent. the above reviewer must be related to the director as that's the only reason i can see for his/her appraisal of this rubbish,some might call it b-movie fun or 'so bad it's good' just to excuse there enjoyment of it,but when the lead actor ( and most experienced cast member) cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you've got a very,very bad movie.avoid at all costs.

when a group of dumb kids (including an unlikable. racist bitch) stay at an old house, it awakens four murderous toltec spirits. can lash la rue save the day? will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display."the dark power" is the kind of really bad horror/comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly. thing is, they didn't. release this. that doesn't excuse the whole thing, as it has a dreadful synthesizer score (including bad attempts at native american music and even worse "comedy" music), bad make up effects (basically halloween masks), and atrocious acting (ok, the fat guy was alright, though everyone else is terrible, and la rue, a western movie vet, seems embarrassed to be there-not that i blame him really.)the worst thing though, is the comedy aspects. sure, dumb teens is one thing, but when the movie keeps talking about the toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil, only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying, bumbling fools, all hope is dashed. combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill. there is no skill on display here, as it all is just stupid, and not "so dumb it's fun" either. i mean "smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock aren't i dumb" dumb.not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster. terrible movie, and not even worth a rental.

this film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. after a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.we are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates, including one tart who is always half dressed. during this stage the film heightens tension with strange "plinky plinky" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.i stopped paying attention for a while but when i looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing. one word of advice if you are ever trapped in your home by some nutter - get some cardboard boxes and a tray.although we did skip half the film, because it was totally non interesting or memorable, we are now at the stunning conclusion, the last surviving creature thing fights a "whip duel" with grandpa and his magic whip. i wont say what happens here, but i can say the whip battle is full of tension, with aerial fights, split level fights and all manner of drama.i am now going to shove this film through the door of a neighbour i don't like.

the governess is a moody period piece, the meandering story of a jewish woman who, upon the death of her father, sets out to 1830's scotland, posing as a gentile to get work to support her family in london.rosina - or mary, as she calls herself in a none too subtle piece of symbolic writing - is a rudderless child, a socialite with dreams of being an actress. she strikes up an alliance with her employer, and by accident solves a crucial problem in his research with photography. giddy with success, they begin a halting and uncomfortable affair while the eldest son of her paramour falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with her.and like a child, she fails to understand the consequences of her actions - in the end, betraying those she deceived in order to make a life for herself.many claim this is something of a feminist manifesto, but i disagree. whether intended or not, this film only resonates with me if i think of it as a cautionary tale. in the end, rosina's greatest disappointment is the truth - that she lied, happened upon a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover, and in the end contributed nothing but destruction. as such, the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one she used, made her happy - and that is exactly as it should be.did i need a movie this long and langorous to teach me this lesson? not at all. on the contrary, had it not been for excellent cinematography, unique score and my hope that she'd get her come-uppance, i wouldn't have stuck with it to the end of the film.fans of minnie driver will likely be disappointed by her uneven performance but may wish to see it anyway; i doubt young female fans of jonathan rhys-meyers will be able to stay awake for the payoff they expect, and i can't help thinking this holds too little cultural detail to be of interest, even to photography buffs. the 3 points i award the film are solely for its visual style and score. on the strength of their other work, i assume the actors' performances are so disappointing because of a poor script and worse directing, but they are, in the end, unremarkable.

the governess was, by far, a very pitiful film. i do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. i finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  "why"? honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. there were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation. scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending. it was as if i was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution. actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved. this was my biggest issue with this film. the complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine "ripple-effect" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film. i would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it. it made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all. minnie driver was the worst culprit of this deed. her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent. she would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time. she has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement. it nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with rosina and her sister. she is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention? that was confusing and completely random. is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent. anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching cavendish's daughter anything. the sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between driver and jonathan rhys-meyers nearly had me laughing out loud. i thought maybe i had discovered some magic in this film as rhys-meyers literally "poofed" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama. it felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts). well, it didn't fool me, i saw that he was nearly a "cut-and-paste" character used to strengthen an already weakened story. don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story. again using the "cut-and-paste" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to. it is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character  but i guess that is the name of the game in hollywood. fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.the remainder of the story was unexciting dribble. there were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to grandma about. more family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as i stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation. what may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film i felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me. wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (i will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes  eeewwww). also, she wore the same dress everyday. that was disgusting and i could smell her through the television. sex and dirty laundry. now there is a great film for you! there just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish. nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful. i cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation. i don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation. just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that i used. if you were as confused about that as i was, then you will completely understand the film the governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal  then, maybe this film is for you!grade: * out of *****

i'll preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. i don't own any, i've never rented any, so i might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.i caught this movie on cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend. please don't ask me why i was watching cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend. we were bored with world championship poker. some atrociously bad acting courtesy of misty mundae (and i wish she wouldn't own up to being from illinois, as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here) caught our attention. now normally, the aim of some good soft-core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood. some good sex, tongue in cheek humor, and who know what could happen? after about 15 minutes, and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim, my lady friend said 'if you want to watch the rest of this fine, i am going to bed so i don't have to. please turn the volume off.' here is what i gather from the plot: misty's character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don't come from her wrists. there is some sort of evil villainess involved, who didn't look particularly evil or sexy. spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, m.j. (who is male in this film) constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death.what was good about this film? it ended.what was bad about it? acting to make a third grade pageant look like oscar winners, a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken, college-aged sex perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr. ruth, special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline, humor about as funny as well, i have yet to encounter anything that is lamer. the sex scenes? if we were watching a video, the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button. and the action scenes? some of my old atari vcs games had better choreography.now i know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it's inherent badness. companies like ei don't set out to make good movies: they have a niche and they target it. my experience as a marketer tells me they are right on the money in servicing their audience. but after my brief exposure to 'spiderbabe', i for one can say i am not delving into that world again any time soon. maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they spend so much attention to making the films bad, that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well, they would turn out some very enjoyable 'le bad' cinema, a la troma films in the 80's. sorry folks; the spirit is there, but the effort isn't.though i have to admit that "alice in acidland" intrigues me

sure, this film was retarded. but you expected that the moment you looked at the cover-box. it's a b movie, and on the t&a factor this movie delivered. truthfully, it was funnier than expected. while it was by no means a work of comedic genius, like "the party animal" or "orgazmo", as far as b movies go it was worth the watch, if you're into that sort of thing anyway.christians and morally-oriented parental groups, this is soft-core adult entertainment. if you don't want your children watching sexual content and nudity, then you should keep your children away from this film.

i must give credit to billy dee for trying to pull this off. knowing this was a blaxploitation film, i started my dvd with a certain expectation. i knew it would be low budget... the acting sub-par... but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout. if there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal... or perhaps overacting. as an actor and filmmaker, i cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. yet, i must admit, i could not look away. i don't know if this was like a car wreck you can't turn your eyes from, or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there. this film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong. if walter kronkite were to tell "the aristocrats" joke, it would be a total flop, although the joke itself is hilarious. let dave chappelle tell it, and we are all rolling on the floor laughing. this film needed a "chapelle." now, with that said, if you have the opportunity to purchase this film for the dollar that i did, do it. it is well worth the money. perhaps i will take another dollar, purchase the rights to this film, and remake it. who knows... it might not be any better, but it surely can't be any worse.

this is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. billy dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. it's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and billy dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. it's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.

gold raiders (1951)a dull western/comedy feature with the three stooges (including shemp howard at this point, who i've always enjoyed as the "third stooge") doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. unlike so many of their classic short subjects, gold raiders is not worth revisiting.*1/2 of ****

this is a joke, right? this can't be a real film? it's not even a real video? give any harvey milk high school kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. the film maker's can't be serious... right? is this satire? comedy? drama gone horribly wrong? the script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. the dialogue isn't clichéd. clichéd dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun - but it doesn't and it isn't. worst of the worst - a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a bathrobe carrying a frying pan like something out of a "honeymooners" episode. whaaa??? i have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs. one of the leads is an attractive lunk, the other is not. both can't even manage a convincing kiss. so much for romance. the supporting players are jaw-droppingly over-the-top.everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet. most of the dialogue is (mercifully) unintelligible.this stale cinematic fruitcake isn't even worthy of being the next rocky horror or a gay holiday installment of mystery science theatre 3000. it's just plain bad. in every way. visions of sugarplums will not dance in your head - they will trample your every expectation. have an eggnog and stare at mindlessly at the neighbor's holiday lights - it will be time better spent.

his has to surely be one of the worst gay-themed films of all time. who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. bad sound - bad script - gestures so overboard that they defy reality. a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes.after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative - but not plain pathetic.parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe.and the dvd - no menu access; its worse than a vhs tape. once you start you have to watch the whole thing through - luckily the fast forward button works - with this film and dvd nothing else does.

the horrific production doesn't qualify as a "film." it was obviously shot on video tape, and very poorly at that! there is a constant screaching sound for the audio(sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying. badly dubbed-in music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing rates about a zero!the plot is contrived and ridiculous. a late 20's gay man trying to hide his live-in lover from parents visiting? please! and the reaction the mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing his boyfrioend is beyond melodramatic and rolls right into stupid. talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! the acting is worse than a porno movie, and the direction is very poor!as far as "production" goes, there isn't any!this title is simply a lame videotaped attempt to call itself a "film." there is no heart and soul to give it even the smallest bit of praise.it's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! bad acting! bad writing! bad directing , and the title of "producer" is vanity as this trash probably costed them the price of the videotape they shot it on.this ametuer garbage has no business getting released onto a dvd as it's deceptive to the cunsomer. i cannot stress how horrible this "sugarplum" crap is!

well folks, this is another stereotypic portrayla of gay life however, the additional downside includes poor acting, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline.it is christmas in new york city and our story immediatly "focuses" on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. one of them has not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealot types) know that he is gay (adding to the impluasability of the story 'cause this guy is as efeminant as gay guys come these days) and his parents are coming to viusit him. they will stay in his new york apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for christmas.the story continues to develop around the arrival of the parents, who noone will like anyway and - how through only obvious and predictable ways - they come to learn there son is gay. tears are shed as was my interest in this movie.the cast of charecters, seemed like an intro acting course at the local community theatre. the lovers in this film are mismatched, and there does not appear to be any cohesion to their union.the landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation are undercooked and certainly didnt help move the plot any further.the dragqueen friend who steps to the aid of one of the lovers in his "time of need" is stereotypic and gives a bad name to the unique art of drag.although some guys night find one of the lovers to have a nice body (again, stereotypic imagery) it does not help this story.stay away from this film, especially if you are considering a purchase. you'll shoot yourself if you do!

the best part of this dvd is the cover. it goes down hill from there. there was no chemistry between the leads, the kisses looked like something i traded with my grandmother.the sound was so bad that at least i was spared some of the dialoge.

i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live. i've heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey, i was expecting to see a breakthrough in turkish cinema. what a disappointment.me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of turkish landscape and turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the dvd. well, that was a boring way of wasting it.it was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted. the storyline was not only confusing, but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'hollywood' didn't also work for me.the american characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned, the turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant. the camera movements had no significance. adding a few dervishes (never seen in them in kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -greek style- only made the movie even more confusing. i am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. there are surely worthy movies made by turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect.i give this movie 1 out of 10.

asmali konak has arguably become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey. with its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. personally i do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, ozcan deniz - the lead actor) but i guess the figures speak for themselves.in relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series. not only that, the cultural mistakes were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing (greek style) and breaking plates, which does not exists anywhere within the turkish culture.some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the tv series but this theory has one major fall, the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all. so with that note in mind, me and everyone i know, would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims.

the real problem with this story is that there's not much story to the story. there's hardly any plot to speak of. widower buys an electric grandma for his kids. one kid resists electric grandma. then finally accepts her. then the kids grow up and grandma leaves. really, very little happens. it's much more of a premise than a story.moreover, strip it of it's schmaltz, and you have a story that had already done before, and better: the lonely. same basic idea: person initially can't accept the love of a robot, because it's just-a-machine, then eventually yields and comes to love the robot. the biggest difference is that the lonely is much more powerful, as both the protagonist and we, the audience, are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanism.i also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just *too* perfect. she's not only "human", she's *super-human*. she's *wiser* than a real person, she has no traces of mechanicalness to her at all, and she makes marbles appear out of thin air. it frankly really chafes at credulity to think that she's a machine.

perhaps it's just the format of this film, a documentary, but i believe that the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue. the fact that the actors are also the business owners is a double-edged sword. they know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business they were in, but, since they are not professional actors, they do a very poor job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers. there were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade away with time and the only memory i will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes which i can't remember. watch this if you want a first-hand account of the .com bust and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who didn't become instant millionares. however, be prepared for some nauseating camera work, poor acting, poor dialogue, and an overall bad movie that epitomizes the era of the internet boom.

there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot i completely forgot. who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying. don't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100.............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny

shame shame shame on ua/dw for what you do! i was appalled. do not take kids to see this movie. the humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. certainly *we all* have read theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. dr. seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his "thumbs up" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.what a pity. spend your money on the book. if you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program. this movie is not worth a "free" ticket viewing.stick with the book. the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously. save your money - it will be on cable by saint patty's day.shame shame shame on what they do!!

an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds. don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgement.

most movies i can sit through easily, even if i do not particularly like the movie. i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre. this is the first movie i could not stand to watch. cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen--and i've seen a lot of movies. the acting is okay (myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is really annoying). the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. the plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. the "witty" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a "ho"). even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last forever. do not waste your time. i know small kids who hated this movie. if children can't stand it, i do not know how any adults can. i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. i hated it! so, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! see a good movie!1/10 stars--the lowest review i have ever given a movie.

no redeeming features, this film is rubbish. its jokes don't begin to be funny. the humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. i couldn't enjoy the film at all. although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with monsters inc, finding nemo, jungle book, lion king, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays.

dr. seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! myers proves he can't act in this film. he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. the kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea. he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. the film sure does look tacky! sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. at least the grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. was mike myers even in this movie actually? and another thing, the fish. what is with that stupid fish! first time you see him, he's an actual fish. next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! this film is a total off target wreck. good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. so please if you have the choice, watch the grinch instead of this mess.

spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. the jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are dr. seus aren't there. a very lousy way to waste an evening. my kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. my wife left and did dishes. so i finished it alone. it was the worst "kids" movie i have seen. if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. avoid this movie. it isn't funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label.

i've seen some bad things in my time. a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud; a head on collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; human beings living like animals.but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat.this film is worse than 911, worse than hitler, worse than vllad the impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwaves.it is the most disturbing film of all time, easy.i used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something.i shudder

okay, so i forgot to watch and only caught the last episode, thinking it was the first or second. honestly, i thought cm would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points. the rangers are left stranded on the plains ("we'll have to eat the horses"), for one thing. little newt is bereft, for another. what a downer ending! but my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the finale, is that the episode had no suspense, no big climax, no dramatic confrontations. even the last fight between blue duck and buffalo hump was badly staged. the whole episode had terrible pacing, which is what drives a western. steve zahn was watchable, karl urban (a ringer for johnny knoxville) played call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw. all glowering looks and jingling spurs and jutting chin. and what's with the rangers? they talked big, about cleaning up texas, then milled around aimlessly in the middle of town, getting drunk. and how nice of hal holbrook to loan val kilmer his mark twain wig and stache! the set of austin was like the fake rock ridge from blazing saddles, all facade. i admit i was drawn into the plot, but that's mainly cause there were many things i didn't quite get, thanks to coming in late in story. if i'd watched from the beginning, i might not have gotten to episode three. now i have to go watch silverado to cleanse my palette.

i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.but it turned out to be the the biggest let down. a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss. it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved.how the grinch stole christmas was much better. i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked.growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .lets see what they do with horton hears a who.i hope this one does dr seuss some justice.

holy cow, what a piece of sh*t this movie is. i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie. i guess they didn't know either! i don't remember any farting or belching in the book, do you?they took this all times childrens classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a kaka joke. this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like. i have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) i don't want the kids that i know to think it is.don't take your kids to see, don't rent the dvd. i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.

when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, i know it is bad. i wanted to claw my eyes out. i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to "unwatch", if only it were possible. the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name.to mike myers, i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world. just because it worked for jim carrey, doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians.

well i guess i know the answer to that question. for the money! we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. i admit, i thought the trailers looked bad, but i still had to give it a chance. well i should have went with my instincts. it was a complete piece hollywood trash. once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. this is then compounded with, ............................yes i'll say it, bad acting! i couldn't help but feel like i was watching "coffee talk" on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth. was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman? spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either, but mr. myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie. f-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. save your money!

the sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so i went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day."the cat in the hat" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.mike myers played the cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it is fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.this film, in short is atrocious. the acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.it starts with conrad and sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. when their mother has to go to work, she gets mrs. kwan to babysit. possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs. kwan is watching a taiwanese court room, a `la c-span. she soon falls asleep, and here comes the cat.the film starts to spiral out of control. the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. he's got thing 1 and thing 2, who suddenly start trashing the house. he improvises a tv infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. and when the cat goes full carmen miranda, it's not funny. possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat.too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. if the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the cat's universe. here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.the acting, overall, is horrible. mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat, saying things like "you dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. spencer breslin is great as the trouble-making conrad, and dakota fanning is cute as sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter(accident waiting to happen). alec baldwin's slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by kelly preston. and sean hayes is mr. humberfloob, mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. the latter three are also bland.overall, if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor, cause there's plenty of it and more. save your $7.00 and see something else. as the late great dr. seuss once said,it is fun to have fun, but you have to know how. really, universal, stop! theodore's already turning over in his grave.like my mom always says, "curiousity killed the cat".- the cat in the hat * out of *****

just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. take mike myers, for example. he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days, over ten years ago. he's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. his cat is painfully unfunny. he tries way to hard. he's some weird type a comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. the rest of the movie is just as bad. the sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story. avoid this movie at all costs, folks. it's not even an interesting train wreck. (i hope they'll make horton hears a who with robin williams. then we'll have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy.)

there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short."the grinch" i thought was marvellous - jim carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. i used to like him very much in his "waynes world" and "so i married an axe murderer" days - but ive never been fond of austin powers and "the cat in the hat" has just finished me off. this film was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years! the plot was messy, messy, messy! its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was "mom". they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the cat.i mean - did myers even glance at a script? was one written? the other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to be winging it!on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!! but unfortunately they cant save this film.poor dr seuss - the man was a genius! dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy, messy way!!!1/10

bad. bad. bad. those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 movie in america! what is this country thinking? mike myers looking more like micheal jackson. some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. a lame plot with dirty jokes. it's grotesuque and awful. when green-eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy! (not) eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green-eggs and ham. they'll try to chase sam-i-am and that mean guy who are running away with it. (i hope they don't ruin the classic book.) don't waste time and money by seeing this.

this movie has made me upset! when i think of cat in the hat. im thinking of cat in the hat books. you know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. well, i though that this movie would be a lot like that! but much to my suprise was nothing like the books! insted it is more like young adult humor movie. in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. i think in short this means adult humor. i wish i could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened. if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy.

the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film. mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse. this is his worst film he has ever been in. the acting and the story was just terrible. i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr. seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe baby geniuses. but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film. bo welch should be fired or the writer should. hedeen's outlook: 0/10 no stars f

please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as i did. the fact that i did is not a very good reflection on me. the only redeeming acting job in this clunker was by wes studi. how a 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as lonesome dove is beyond me!! it was a disjointed, rambling, incoherent story. plot lines were not developed, action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending (disappointment) was a fitting ending to this mini-series. val kilmer who i have thought as a reputable actor played one of the strangest roles that i have ever seen him in. his final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director. i have been reading these reviews for years and this show prompted me to sign up!!!

inappropriate. the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa. whale rider gets a pg-13 but this movie gets a pg? please. parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.but all that aside, the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie. the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. the kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with dakota fanning. fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.did i mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? mike myers is absolutely deplorable. i didn't like him as the voice of shrek, and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again. his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers.in the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever.

mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together. he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. i have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made.

well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h * t spells. essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr. seuss's classic. it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. if that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and "the cat" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is. take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.

from the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims. when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.dr suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the "dirty ho" "s.h.i.t" and fake erection scenes etc etc etc. its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t & a. greed greed and more greed.compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into. these guys should stick to making mtv videos. how on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless its the directors family)

this movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) i grew up with dr. seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. "the cat in the hat" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and mike myer's performance as the cat is mostly bewildering. why the borscht belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? i had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are simple. this movie is overblown and way, way too long.you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant, but this one set a new low. how could mike myers need the money?

if you liked the grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation. mike myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to "grace" the screen in recent times. his voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater. not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. save your money and go see looney tunes: back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.

the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it. i saw it for free at college. and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles). i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie, but i have never seen anything more depressing. this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch (which has its opponents, but i enjoyed it very much). it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.you want a funny seuss adaptation? go with the grinch.

audrey, i know you truly cherish your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. dr. seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway. the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.it is indeed your property to do with as you wish. i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while. save what is left of dr. seuss. thank you.

i just watched lonesome dove, return to lonesome dove, streets of laredo and dead man's walk. all excellent. this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted.in the previous series, captain call and gus mccrae come off as tough respectable cowboys. despite the fact that caption call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over. in dead man's walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers. in comanche moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks. i had to stop watching.i suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile. it's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise.

the photography is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. the various scenes are cut, or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and tedious. this slowness continues the entire show. it is a very tedious show to watch. . . . i believe that more scenes should have been added, but that would make it a longer show. it is very slow-moving. the writers should have made it just a 1-night show, and not prolong our agony night after night. there is nothing else on, otherwise i'd change the channel (the first night). i feel bad for the indians of the time, and am angry at the white-men for what they did to the indians, but thats our history.

i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one. it wouldn't hold a candle to the other series. it has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesn't add to the storyline at all. i agree with the others that it doesn't seem to develop a story that is interesting. it is slow and plodding and i only know what the comanches are planning to do. maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but i am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out. i am of apache heritage from the texas/new mexico area but i don't recognize much of what is happening. maybe i am just ignorant of the facts but this isn't doing much to educate me.

agustus and call really did nothing? why are they hero's they did nothing other then get to places after the bad guys where dead. what was the point of this show? i was very very disappointed. i expected more action, more story, and to see the birth of heros and great deeds. instead i saw very little, it seemed like agustus and call where just side story's for the great indian chief. i'm not even sure that the history is even very close. they did very little to show why the texans and comanche fought against each other.the only good part about this movie was zhan who played gus very very well and is a great actor. a lot of good story that could have been gone to waste. it was sad and i wish that i had not watched it.

i must have missed a part of this movie... i found myself asking who is this? and, when did that happen? it seemed to jump around but i kept watching for fear i was missing something and it would all be explained to me. i loved lonesome dove but this movie made no sense to me at all. i did love all the actors but what happened to the rest of the movie? it made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part..as far as the scenery - i thought it was fine..it made me feel though like i was leafing through a book and leaving pages out.. the ending had me a little confused too although i imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was meant to leave you wondering if his father would finally come home to his son and be a father since his mother was now gone..i would like to read the book just to see what i missed in the movie..i don't expect this one to win any awards.

i'm not sure this review contains spoilers, but i'm playing it safe by indicating there might be. regardless, it's unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn't familiar with the book.there's an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse. "comanche moon" is such a mouse.the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans. in adapting it for tv, mcmurtry and osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds. unfortunately, there's little in the novel that we don't already know about gus, woodrow, and their friends. so the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in "lonesome dove". the indians -- who have their own story to tell -- are largely relegated to the background -- so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's titled "comanche moon".the novel has no overall story line, or much of a "point". this could have been fixed in the movie, by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans, who bring "civilzation". this opportunity was missed.unlike "lonesome dove", "comanche moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships -- at least among the americans. the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened. and for a (net) four-hour film, it is remarkably episodic and choppy. one gets the feeling the script was originally longer, and cut to reduce the production costs.the screenplay comprises mostly clichéd dialog, aphorisms, and platitudes. coming from the author of "the last picture show", it's a startlingly bad script. mcmurtry and osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations, but did not.some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered, for no obvious reason. for example, clara (cassie) shows her intense hatred of woodrow (jack) by condemning gus (ennis) for always running off to be with his "pard". that tart little revelation of clara's sexual jealously is gone. then there's the scene where the ur-dense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon "compromise" her. the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher; the film tones it down, and doesn't portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (when i read that scene in the novel, i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach -- or worse.) there are other changes, some of them understandable. inish scull's eyelids are not cut off; to do so would like have required expensive cgi. but buffalo hump has no hump! (perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis.) and buffalo hump's character is "kindler and gentler". he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels.the only good thing about this near-turkey is steve zahn's remarkable performance -- not so much as gus mccrae, but as robert duvall playing gus mccrae. it is uncanny. he perfectly duplicates duvall's mannerisms and manner of speech, without ever appearing "deliberate" or self-conscious. as was duvall, he is wholly "within" the character. and he actually shows us gus becoming "more gus" in the third part.the best thing about "comanche moon" is that it won't spoil our affection for "lonesome dove", not just a great western, but a great american film.ps: for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top -- that's the way she was in the book.

i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info. i saw the 9+ rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i'd seen. (as reference, i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever. i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the 50s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre.) so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read "more". there i found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development, poor editing, feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot (mgm's is long gone), and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld. my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0".this got me to wondering about the process that yields a 9+ rating. if the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation? i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available. now i am not so sure.

did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews? i mean, really, it's a bit hackneyed, and spike isn't that funny. he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny. there are so many mediocre gigs in this show; like once, the opening sketch was "talk show, apply directly to the forehead," over and over. and another that featured spike and another dude getting high, and it wasn't even funny. they didn't even do anything but sit around and laugh, over and over. ha ha! and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck. ha ha! i mean, really, spike just gets funny guests on his show, that's why people like this show

this show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show. there are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. it doesn't look like the writers know the difference between what's funny and what's just weird or gross.it has its moments. when spike hosed down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly, it hit it's peak. but the hilarious moments are too few, and there's too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark.the show's better than, say, watching a test pattern or the qvc network, but it needs some better writers.reading the glowingly positive imdb comments on this show, i am convinced that most of them were written by show staffers and by relatives and personal friends of spike.it just isn't very good most of the time.

maybe i'm alone here, but this is a crap show. i'm sorry but i was lured in when i found out about lil' bill o'reilly (which i had no idea came from this show until months later, and has honestly since lost its appeal) but i gave the show a fair shot. spike tries to hard to make himself into something he's not, which is to say, he tries to be human. fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in. his sketches try to hard, he himself isn't funny, and the writers are struggling to write material for a no-talent host. there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show, and fox.....fox we had some good times, but you need to get your f$%*ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another "me-too" network.

first of all..i've seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porno flicks. how bad was "chris moltisante" as stewie ungar? on the sopranos, chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief. and then throw in "bobby baccala" as one of his vegas cronies. it's just too much to take in a dramatic movie. neither actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for tony,paulie, or uncle junior. and i want to know who did the makeup for this disaster? i want that person to be my make-up person over the next 25 years so i'll never age a day either. so that's all i'll write on this movie since it's not worth wasting too much more of my time. yes i do know that michael imperioli and steve schirippa are their real names.

it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids, bully, etc. but then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. who is the main character? is this a serious film or some gregg araki-esquire over the top goofy film? is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? i have no clue. i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. i cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the have's have not's. i got it way back in the beginning. kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends. wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. teenage caveman, which larry didn't write but did direct, was terrible. but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. wassup rockers was just plain bad.

there's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me. i'm not racist against latinos. hell, i'm half brazilian. i loved the movie kids. it doesn't make any sense. these kids just go around and do nothing. they're not even good at skating. the whole time i'm just waiting for something, anything, to happen! but it doesn't. nothing happens the whole movie. did i mention they suck at skating. i might make a movie called beat up rockers, and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids. i'm not even going to get into it, this movie sucks. please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake.

larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. kids, bully, and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. these films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. kids exposed us to the proliferation of a.i.d.s. and sexual promiscuity among the young. bully touched upon similar issues. ken park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. irrefutably, all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.wassup rockers is about a group of poor hispanic skateboarders from south-central las angeles who go to arbitrarily go to beverly hills to skate. that's it.wassup rockers is nothing.it has no substance. it has an essentially nonexistent narrative. and, like kids, it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting. however, unlike kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. there is better acting in porn. this film features, without a doubt, the most terrible performances i've ever seen in a feature film. one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process, but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy, folks. might i add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you'll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater, or you'll regret it afterward.but then again, it's not like they had much of a script to work with. every line that is uttered is a contrived, pathetically-delivered, and irritating beyond all measure. the story itself is ludicrous. it starts out reasonably enough, but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. this begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clichéd national lampoonish encounters, characters being killed off for no reason, and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. shots go on much longer than they need to. be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight, overlong, lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. but then again, with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. perhaps wassup rockers would have worked better as a short film.anyways, i could go on like this. this is the worst film larry clark has made yet. for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. this is by far the tamest film he's made yet, and it's also the worst. it's flat out horrible. like, uwe boll horrible. definitely the worst one i saw at the festival.1/10

i've never been a big larry clark fan, but somehow, i've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. now, i like independent films, and i grew up very much into punk rock, and i'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. not every punk song incorporates "oi!" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.but the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are "how kids really are," and as such, you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere, because that's the cinema verite feel he's going for. however, when he shoots a ridiculous death scene (pick any of them, save for the opening drive-by), the over-stylized attempts at what i assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (in most cases, far worse than a student film) and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story. john cassavettes and "date movie" make poor bedfellows, as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - a really, really bad one at that.

look, don't get me wrong i love independent films but come on! i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f***ing nightmare. i am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.i am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. please don't waste your precious time and money. i am sorry to be so harsh but come on! it dragged on and and on and on. remember when the kids got into that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis? how did they just blend in? it made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with whoever they wanted. i know im blathering but my mind is just buzzing with everything i hated about this film.

i recently had to watch this for a project in a sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie i have ever had to sit through. it was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the "good bits" taken out. bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.the female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. consider this exchange: "he's hot." "he has a girlfriend." "do you have a girlfriend?" "no." *girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes. boy comes out and sits next to other boy, girl saunters off* "did you hit that?" "no, i didn't want to take my pants off." "you're stupid." another girl shows up when the boys are going to beverly hills, gets in the trunk with one of the boys, and when they get pulled over by a cop, you see the car bobbing up and down.a homosexual pervert, a trigger-happy clint eastwood look alike, and what seems to be a luchador mask all add to the inanity. one of the boys gets caught by a cop, no one cares. one of the boys gets shot, no one cares.someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised, and it shows. just awful. i would never recommend this film to anyone.

that's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer's intelligence by losing track of time, plot, and reason for being produced.plus, how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in hollywood is beyond me.

ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist. this is one of them. this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. eddie deezen is just plain annoying as tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, don (william hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. tony, as i said, is an annoying little twit. this makes the whole movie a complete mess. the movie is terribly daffy. it's too cartoonish. the main point i'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness. it doesn't work that way. believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. if you don't take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. the thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody. you have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously. it also feels like they're just mocking woody allen, and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible.

what in the world! this piece of gambling cinema would have been suitable for the lifetime network. michael imperoli is a good actor but i think his portrayal as "stu" fell short. the montages were unbearable and too many. the supporting cast, where are you? whoever did the casting should be partially at fault. the cinematography was useless. a gambling story with an after school feel to it. stories of this sort should be left for the oliver stone's of the world. it would still suck ass but at least it would be fun to watch. it was an attempt that lost it's wheels before the race ever begun. mario andretti in the 1982 indy 500 came to mind.

if you liked william hickey in "prizzi's honor", he resurrects his character, as don anthony in "mob boss". this is a very weak "godfather" satire with few laughs. stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he's doing in this schlock-fest? morgan fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. eddie deezen vacillates between "three stooges" slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation. fatally flawed, "mob boss" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom, and numerous other nonsense. - merk

this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. i can't believe people actually a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a film c) actually expect it to be successful. words can't even describe how horrible this film is. i enjoy my fair share of teen movies, but this didn't even come close to being funny. in fact, it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible. i can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the film where i even managed to squeeze out a chuckle (other than the laughs regarding how bad it was).renting this was one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made. its been a day since i've seen the film, and i'm still in shock regarding how horrible it was. avoid at all costs.2/10

i could crap a better movie. this is a waste of time and money. it makes me sick that movies like these are actually getting made and the people making them actually think they're good. i happen to like teen comedies, when they're done well. this movie, however, takes this genre to a new low. with movies like this, people think it's actually okay to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it. it's sadism.

my mom brought me this movie on a dvd. a guy in a rental recommended it. but in fact, this might be the worst movie i've ever seen. you know, i didn't expect much from this film, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was senseless. i was looking forward to see christine lakin in this movie because i loved step by step. even she was a huge disappointment. the story was completely unreal. one of the party guys is dead (he wasn't dead in fact, he woke up later), the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. but then there comes a homosexual, policeman... there is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes??? come on, just be realistic at least. waste of money. really...

everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if i'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. in all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. good: the overall plot was mildly interesting. the music was overall pretty good. several of the songs (when you could hear them) were actually pretty cool. the only musical issues i had were: #1) the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to take away from the suspense), #2) the song being played when the lead characters went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and #3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while danny trejo hung a man (sounded like a pretty cool song, but it should have ripped out across the scene when danny trejo got froggy). now for the completely bad stuff: the script was atrocious. i mean, horrible. i've seen smoother dialogue in a star wars movie. advice to the writer from a part-time writer and full-time movie buff: when you write dialogue, ask yourself, "is this something that people would actually say?" honestly, the script was laughable. i want to slam the acting, but with that kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. the mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue. i know it was low-budget, but words don't cost money - if you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can pull it off. this movie didn't seem to have either, but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film.

this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak, but the acting was unbelievable bad, and at times pathetic. very unrealistic dialogs people in real life don't talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs. even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible. the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations. there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesn't have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to. how did this movie win/ get nominated for awards oh my god!!

wow, this movie really sucked down below the normal scale of dull, boring, and unimaginative films i've seen recently. the acting was poor and robotic. the story was so bland you could have summed it up with a simple 5-minute short. audio was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen to; perhaps it was unedited from the camera it was shot off of? i'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers were commenting on, but it wasn't this one. perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review, at least before the real reviews started to show up.save your time or you'll just be wasting your time and money on this film. absolute suckage!

don't get fooled by the 'awards' and the comment below. this is just 1 poor movie. the way george katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. the conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this. de in the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else. his emotions don't match with the things that happen in the film.the things he says as a voice-over doesn't add anything to the film. it just makes zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the clouds.the story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy. all parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors. let's hope jon rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.

this was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though i was watching a dvd, sometimes i couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). the plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script?), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?), the 'dark suits' gang (how original - couldn't think of a better name i guess), the drug dealer's hot girlfriend (gotta have a hot latina if your going to have la gangs i guess, but really...), etc etc can't believe i watched the whole thing.

return to sender, a.k.a. convicted, is almost imperfect. the one good thing about this particular film was that i was never bored. that being said, the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that i saw.rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work, i will simply comment that nothing works. there are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through. the acting in the film is not very good, although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by george lucas. there was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. did i mention that there were some plot holes? by the end of the movie, you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun, why kelly preston trusts aidan quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed, how aidan quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie, why aidan quinn didn't by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc.with all that being said, this is certainly a b-movie, and a terrible one at that. the unfortunate thing is that it just isn't bad enough to be good. if you value your time, please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one.

what could've been a great film about the late poker pro (pre-poker craze) stu "the kid" unger turned into a disappointment.you can tell the filmmakers were working on a short-string budget. everything look filmed on the cheap. timelines seemed a bit off to me.casting michael imperoli from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice. he looked too old to play the baby-faced stu, he looked way too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at footage from the 1997 wsop main event, the real stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them), and i kept expecting adriana to pop up and yell "chris-tu-phur!!!" also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from angie's previous relationship that committed suicide in the late '80s.every time i saw vincent van patten appear, i kept thinking he was going to announce "show tunes going off in stu's head." like he does on the wpt.if you're looking for real stuey footage, check espn classic because they rerun the 1997 wsop main event every so often. or try youtube. avoid this move like a bad beat.

slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, timothy dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. i wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! but dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. this movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow. your time would be better spent watching mr. dalton in 1970's "wuthering heights" or the early 1980's bbc version of "jane eyre". poor sela ward, so lovely, but so wooden.... surely she's been better in other movies.

this is an adaptation of an edith wharton work, whose writing is amazing. sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation wharton's work depicts. ward and dalton aren't so bad, but alicia witt's wooden performance made me wince. she was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and i never believed a word out of her mouth. when she asks sela ward "why can't i move you?" near the end of the film, i couldn't help but answer: "that's what i've been wondering for the last hour and a half!!!"

the first shiloh film was enjoyable by adults as well as children. this one starts with about an hour of filler where not much happens, with stilted dialogue; only in the last act is there any significant action that really moves the plot along. the dog is still cute, though, and young kids may enjoy it.

jane russell was an underrated comedienne and singer (see son of paleface and gentlemen prefer blondes), but you'd never guess it from her display here. a real stinker, produced by howard hughes in his all-too-successful effort to kill off rko radio pictures.the movie kills its first opportunity to show off sexy jane when it places her in a bubble bath and then has her chastely singing "i'll be switched (if i ain't gettin' hitched)"--and it's all downhill from there. in her autobiography, russell apologized for the movie's number "lookin' for trouble" because it was supposedly so risque--nowadays you could show it on the disney channel. (by the way, said autobiography has a jaw-dropping photo of russell in a bikini, far sexier than anything

i'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is. bottom line: it was horribly acted, had enormous plot holes and went absolutely nowhere. the only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie: "a married man with a struggling business has a fling with his secretary." huh?? wrong movie apparently, although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true.--shelly

"tart" is a pathetic attempt at film making which wanders around and among a bunch of manhattan teens exploring all the usual teen preppie stuff...sex, drugs, and classical music almost completely without story, focus, or purpose. griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while swain dutifully works her way through another in her long list of dog flicks. nothing in this films works and wayne should consider getting a real job. not recommended for anyone. pu! ugh! (d)

why do people make bad movies? didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? there is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that i found this "movie" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and poorly acted. i admire them for the try, but the "actors" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. this movie deserves zero stars. but i did not have that option, so it gets a 1.

it was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. it was a poor man's (not to mention high school) "less than zero". i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. so many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. the voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst. i'm sure there are plenty of others to watch. don't waste your time on this.

this is probably the worst movie i've seen in a long time. independent or not, solid writing is a must. ditto for directing and acting. i know these actors can act (i've seen them in sporanos and more...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. probably a little of both.....probably a lot of both! technically ok, just bad, bad, bad... i have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the poker magazines, because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. " hey' we made it, so it's gotta be good, right?" not so fast bucky. i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made, much less sold and distributed, and for that i commend these folks. but the final product, leave a bad taste in my mouth.p.s. i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster. tomorrow i'm going to get my money back.

spoilers!i gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that i will never forget.....by the way, my husband rented this surprising non-blow 'em up almost chick looking flick...but i guessed why when i saw the cover....girls in school uniforms....duh....lol....ah well, men if ya can't beat 'em join 'em.....;-)bijou philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen...too cute......not only gets into bestiality (her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character)..that would be the first worthwhile scene..then she enters a restroom in a lovely gown & goes into a stall....after a bit she gets up, goes out to the party she & the pathetically sad 'cat' character are at,& hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party...the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says, "oh my god it's poo."i love bijou phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices, this would definitely be one of them....and um, i would rent it for the poo scene if i were you.....i am not a big poo jokes fan, but it definitely puts the 'party people' in their place (they didn't look like they were having a good time anyway.....lol)...you will never forget these two scenes...hmm, but is that what we want in our databanks?....maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all....loldominique swain is kind of squirrelly & sad in her confusing nonsensical role in 'tart'. i don't know, i can't decide if i like her because she is so into indie films?? indie films are awesome & all but couldn't she pick a few good ones? i am going to check out a few more of her movies and reserve judgment.... but this one was, (pardon the reference to beasts) a dog.....

for the first time in reviewing films, i found myself immediately uninterested in this story. i don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. within the first thirty minutes, i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. i felt as if i had seen this structure before, and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. after thinking that it may just be my mood, i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. i just didn't care. that is not a good sign. the characters were bland. when i say bland, i literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate. the story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism. now, i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective. the casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. you knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces. these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by wayne.what immediately pulled me away from this story? it was mainly the characters. i have seen most of brad renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself. director larry clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character. within the first twenty minutes of renfro's screen time i was bored. i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. it was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive. he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite. without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown. renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film. while i am on the subject  nobody showcased the best of their abilities. what is going on with dominique swain, outside of lolita, i don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as cat storm doesn't help. bijou phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost. rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act. melanie griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in. maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.my biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film. nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together. there were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed. the robberies, the teenage "angst and woe", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random kids in the hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together. with this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape. family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers. wayne did not complete the task at hand.while i hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film i am left with little choice. with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any "good" behind tart. this was a film i had heard nothing about, and after viewing it i can see why. all wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film tart. it is hard for me to say this, but wayne ruined this film. while i don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as wayne took the helm. while most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in tart you can credit nothing. from the opening sequence until the end, i felt like i was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal. no consistency, no strength.overall, this film is a waste of your time. if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film. while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an etch-a-sketch. it was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up. wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life. avoid at all costs! grade: * out of *****

i rented this movie hoping that it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. what i got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards. do i want to see the romance with his wife? no do i want to see about everything that went on in this guy's life except poker? no. well thats what you get with this film. the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap. the film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. it simply sleep walks its way through the script. the ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into ungar's mind. instead it focuses on what was already obvious. he was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas. the movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were un extraordinary rather than the extraordinary. the poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. ungar's achievements of winning the wsop 3 times seem life after thoughts. a 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie.. or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie.if you want to see a film about gambling watch rounders. it at least has style.

20 people rated this a 10! that ballot box was stuffed better than a christmas turkey! speaking of turkey's, here's a traditional story hoping to piggy-back on the current poker craze - without success. told entirely in linear flashback, and when i say "told" i mean talked to death, this film never let's a picture suffice when words can be used to exposit.stu unger's childhood fascination with cards and his associations with hoodlums might sound like interesting movie material, but the director manages to suck the life out of them. at no point did i feel the least bit of sympathy for unger, a genius at cards who threw it all away on other forms of gambling at which he was not so proficient. of course, this leads, as we wade through three musical montages, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, loss of family, and finally his redemption (sort of). big yawn!

having just finished reading the book "one of a kind" a week ago, i was thinking "this would make a great movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players". i was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night. i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film. i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation. what a major letdown!all of the intriguing things about stu ungar were skimmed over quickly, and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody. ungar may have been a burnt-out jerk, but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively. that is what made him so fascinating. why not focus on that?and talk about watering down the real truth. this guy was excessive about absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep-deprivation. he gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn, he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens, his body was perpetually emaciated, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards. now that's a story!too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his ties with "vincent" and his daughter were hardly touched on) and hardly anything about his drugs use (which was exorbitant), his insane gambling and his incredible card-playing abilities.probably too late now, but i hope someone remakes this film properly. i had no problem with imperioli. he is excellent. the script just left him with nothing interesting to say.

wow, i just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and i'm not talking about the premature death of the great stu ungar. this film i'm sorry to say was terrible. absolutely terrible. a true tragedy in filmaking history. well maybe i'm being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar then don't even consider coming near this one. and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were trivialised and made out to be great novelty scenes. i watched it because of stu ungar but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but unpleasantly painful

well, the movie was no terrible, but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger. this movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born. i suggest reading the book "one of a kind" the real unger story. they left out huge parts of his life. they also at times did not understand the real caractor that he was. the actual facts of his life were at times out of order. and in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have. so please don't watch the movie; read the book. by the way i'm not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100% to the real story, but they did not even come close!!!

an insult to both poker and cinema, this movie manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant, and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore. still a fun film to make jokes about, from the lame gangster movie clichés of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. hilariously, stu ungar wins all three of his world series titles without playing a single hand on screen. his infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. his coke habit? 1 scene. his incredible memory? 0 scenes. they couldn't even get any real poker players. what did they cover? a lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs. oh, and a montage of stu waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense. why do i care so much about this little sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker craze? because i think there's still a great film to be made about stu ungar waiting for someone willing to do it right.

for the most part, "michael" is a disaster  ten minutes of charm and ninety's worth of missteps.travolta and macdowell do their best, frequently rising above nora ephron's numbingly banal script. but the film moves like a snail. and even within its fantasy context, the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis. (reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime  an apparent angel living on earth  out of their sight?) someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro ephron that william hurt, brilliant in so many other films, is no tom hanks. the movie's "climax" redefines the word contrived. ephron may be shooting for heaven here, but unfortunately "michael" is a long, long ride through cinema heck.

my website (theflickguy.org) lists "michael" as one of the worst films of the modern era. the following is an excerpt: "everyone slums some time in their lives, this was travolta's turn. i still don't know what the point of this terrible film was. nora efron has proved to be a competent writer and director, so what the hell happened here? the archangel michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a ham-fisted, chain-smoking sugar addicted fornicating slob whose biggest contribution to humanity (after sending lucifer to hell) was that he invented "standing in line". yes, how funny and charming. i don't find this offensive, i find it stupid. in its defense, i can say that the ending was ever bit unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attempt at story telling."

this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth, although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie.if i took this movie to heart, as someone who knows and believes the bible, i would have canned it pretty quick, but i don't think the general atmosphere was either mean-spirited or blasphemous. it was just ludicrous or just plain stupid.i mean, john travolta as a grubby angel? smoking? scratching his groin? quoting the beatles? a "warring angel" who knows nothing about heaven? an angel who flirts with all the women? yes, it's all absurd and certainly biblically- incorrect. i could tolerate all that but i don't know how many people, whatever beliefs they hold, who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it. it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and andie macdowell. some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it's insulting to any discriminating viewer.this is another nora ephron-directed film. man, i can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed. at least she's consistent.

this movie makes you wish imdb would let you vote a zero. one of the two movies i've ever walked out of. it's very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors. well...armageddon almost takes it, but not quite.

do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made? stop wondering. i'm telling you, michael is it!it is not "heartwarming," "entertaining," or "travolta at his best." it just sucks. if i had kids, i would let them watch deep throat before michael!a sold-out john travolta, a washed-up and balding william hurt, and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film.but wait...you'll get to hear andie mcdowell sing! yeah. hollywood really s**t all over us with this one!

i wanted to like this movie, but there is very little to like about it. it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa (northwest iowa, i guess), reminiscent of norman lear's cold turkey, which was one of the best movies ever made, according to people on imdb. so far, so good. and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy milbank's motel on earth? well, give it a chance, it's supposed to be a comedy. okay, so far, so good. but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do, and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had. the other characters in the movie don't have much appeal, either. michael brings a dog back to life, and we're supposed to be in awe of that. the people make up corny country songs. in the end, stapleton dances with travolta. big deal. if she was smart, she wouldn't even be in this movie. when it was over, i thought, "gee, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, corny, sacrilegious movie!" it's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else.

czech movie goers may have enjoyed and rated this film highly because it was czech, but i found it to be trite, tedious, moronic, boring, and insipid. again, i suspect "ramping" in order to increase sales of this dog of a film. amazon describes this film as being about a couple of fellows that refuse to grow up, but i will go one further--i think it is about two fellows that have entered a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone. i have been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film, and i would believe it. when he saw his performance he probably realized what a gosh awful job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which i am sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in "autumn spring." don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. it's nothing but a dog in a manger.

i happened upon a rare copy of this early almodovar film with high expectations - almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, i enjoyed his 1988 film "women on the verge of a nervous breakdown", and i had read one or two very positive reviews of the film. well, i must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film. i just found it incoherent, tasteless, and boring. yes, there are plenty of innuendos, people in drag, and crude sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 (which was almost certainly almodovar's intention), but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years, leaving a limp storyline. beyond that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - i just didn't find this film funny. i suppose it is possible there is a very select audience for a film like this, but i'm just not part of that audience, and not sure that i want to be.

i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it. even about three-quarters of the way through, i still thought it was jumbled and a bit incoherent, but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion. and then the bottom fell out. not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone, but the conclusion flips everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its headfor no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world, yeah i'm cool, and i know it. i love a good twist, i love a good ah-ha moment, but only when it is relevant to the story at hand. the complete misguidance on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale, timelines didn't need to be parallel and they didn't need to be separated by a week. all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director gavin hood and screenwriter kelley sane, which may be a good thing, because looking back, it wasn't really as solid a movie as i initially was going to blindly give it credit for.it is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the film-going public's consciousness, but it needed a story that delved deeper into the connotations and politics involved, rather than gloss over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husband's disappearance and the angst-filled rebellion of a daughter against her "interrogator" father. i understand that the bottom-line film attendee needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i don't fault it for going that route. my only qualm is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should be getting. instead we are shown numerous plot lines, all confusingly brought to the forefront before being sent back into the nether regions of our consciousness, never to be returned to. so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for, the wife? the interrogator? the cia agent? the victim? the senator? the middle eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend? at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would, which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid out.everything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion. this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so innocuous that you can't believe how huge the waves it spread were. the old butterfly wings flapping quote is in full effect, because one boy's mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many. whether by death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or career suicide; no one really escapes unscathed. however, at the end of the day, only the story about the man who has been excised to egypt for torture is really interesting. we are led to believe he is unequivocally innocent from the start, yet he is waterboarded, electrocuted, etc. in order to extract any information he might have. when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled, (whether true or not), and an observer without the guts to partake or stop it, the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end. the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entirety.i don't want to belittle people like reese witherspoon, (the victim's wife), or her senate employed ex, played by peter sarsgaard, because they actual do a good job with what they are given. even meryl streep, her kooky accent, and alan arkin don't detract too much. however, it is the trio of jake gyllenhaal's cia agent, yigal naor's interrogator, and omar metwally's victim that truly shine. naor is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worry-filled as a father attempting to locate his daughter. this man is brutal, but he is because that is what his occupation calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers. metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him. whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone, we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out. as for gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success, he finds a part that suits him. the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind, causing both ambivalence and a need to intervene. the two feelings wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish demeanor suit that battle perfectly.it is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main focal point, despite being the namesake of the film. with all the clutter around the edges, we as an audience get bounced around too much, lulled into a sense of time and sequence, and then slapped in the face as it all unravels in more of a laugh on us then a, "bet you didn't see that coming." i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie. had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more, but as is, one can still take some positives from the severely flawed whole.

the movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition, torture and the politics of the war on terror. others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie. my review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point.several questions are raised by this movie. first of all, was the protagonist guilty or not? there is no satisfying explanation for why the nsa decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place. is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the nsa thinks is a terrorist? if there is, the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me. it is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step.if the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? perhaps, we was well-trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty. however, there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either.the various other loose ends out there are: 1. so, a rogue cia agent has him released and flown back home. what prevents the nsa from picking him up again? a little publicity in the washington post? please give me a break here... if a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what does corinne whitman have to fear? 2. if the nsa has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom, why couldn't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed? 3. the plot is even more stupid anyways. any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not on one that can be traced back to him and his house.the whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers' heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. but when you think about it with any more depth, there is nothing of substance in this movie, only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what, that is it?!!!" at the end of the movie.

there are many so-called anti-war/anti-govt. policy films around now which start off as a mea culpa and end with 'our poor boys are getting hell out there so let the world sympathise with them, it's not their fault' - kind of stuff. i was half afraid that this would be another in that style even if it treated another subject/aspect of the same subject. i nearly didn't go and see it; for that matter, i almost did not write this review. what did we get here? an egyptian gets taken off to a secret off-shore torture centre, on u.s. orders, but it is another egyptian who has to do the torturing, not an american: 'see, we americans have clean hands,' and the egyptians are a bad lot anyway so let them harm their own. oh, and the goody had to be an american with a conscience: indeed many americans have them, but here the concept was misplaced. yes, we all know it is called extraordinary rendition and it began in clinton's time and it is now used for reasons well beyond control. otherwise it was very hackneyed and nervous about really condemning the u.s. for being party to torture; as if the makers were afraid to go the whole way for fear of being slanged as unpatriotic or whatever (take a look at the message board! anyone apologising gets a faceful of heavy verbal artillery). torture is a terrible thing, whether one is guilty or not; in the 18th century, frederickii, king of prussia, abolished it for convicted murderers - though i must say, a life sentence for a child molester is far less than what i want to see. all right, what about torture? this film did not really bring out its horror and hopelessness enough. when you are under torture,(now come the capitals for emphasis, i am not shouting) you will say anything, even if it is not true, even if you have not done the thing you are accused of, in the vain hope that if you say amen to whatever they are peddling, it will stop. it does not, but you never learn and you keep on saying that you did whatever it is they say you did, tho' you did'nt. another thing the film did not bring out enough was that torture is exceedingly, indescribably humiliating, and that feeling stays with you your whole life. it somehow changes people inside. how do i know all that? don't ask.re-edit: two things: the arabic that was used in the film was not the egyptian dialect. it's sort of worse than setting a film in new zealand with locals as the characters and everyone has american accents. also, the dreadful little preacher who was inciting his ignorant audience to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion, which should have been brought out. nor was it anywhere explained that any nincompoop can become a mullah/imam; he doesn't need any special qualifications, and that is a hiatus which needs to be put right: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and tne u.s.a.'s great ally, saudi arabia, finances so many of them. many thanks for this space.

i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television... and sorely disappointed at the end result.the only "amazing" thing was the wall crawling (despite the visibility of the cable). i didn't think nick hammond was peter parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. you could tell they were two different actors.granted, i can also spot in the modern spider-man movies when i am looking at tobey macguire and when i am looking at cgi. but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi. still, the 70's version could have been better despite lack of special fx.the webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them. and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in. hello? he's the web slinger people.sorry... didn't mean to get so worked up, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.

spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre: in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character, had complex moral issue, round characters and also highlighted social and political issues. in other words: spiderman was the comic book's coming of age. this tv series lacks all of those components. it's just a straightforward good buy / bad guy tv series suffering from obvious budgetary rerstraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. spiderman nylon webbing is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek. nicholas hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time. i think he was well into his thirties wheras spider,man was really teenager at the time. for some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing.

opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by theodor sparkuhl, and a good (not great) performance by jannings as henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera-work. henny porten chews the scenery as anne.it's all very beautiful; but it's all surface and no depth. the melodramatic tale of a woman wronged made it a hit in america where the expressionistic "the cabinet of dr. caligari" flopped in the same year (1920), proving that what is popular is not what endures. lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies, not sterile spectacles like this.

the digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences lack suspense. this was essentially made for tv and it shows. david suchet looks bored and nigel planer looks down right embarrassed! and as for robert carlyle's dick van dyke london accent, no comment! if you want to pass away an hour or two when you've nothing on then it will do. if your going to buy the dvd wait a few weeks and pick it up in the bargain bin at asda, cos thats where its heading! if the budget was bigger and richard doyle's book followed more closely, then it could have been something special, but as it stands its a bit poor. watch the trailer instead! or read the book and see what could have been.

this movie follows in the tracks of the riddle for an all star british cast in a downright awful movie! poor cgi effects, poor editing, poor direction, a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin.nigel planer should've donned his neil wig once more & gone out with a laugh at least!it was like a particularly long & drawn out episode of "torchwood" but without the camp fake canadian doctor fella...it had the same overly dramatic music though, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to drum up some tension.oh the humanity!

well as the headline suggests this is not the particularly good movie i was hoping it would be. i thought it would be great with mr fully monty man himself but tragically not. from the beginning i literally lost interest immediately when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out there is random water coming from under the door, then bam a full on flood through the route of the house its hard to believe they didn't notice the rising water level outside or at least heard it. sorry for this to sound like a rant but it really grinds my gears and has affected me. most acting was poor and the story tried to copy nearly every cliché to each disaster movie ever but just failed in that sense. cgi was poor i could do a better job using ms paint, directing poor too, and at the end i didn't care about 1 character at all!!! don't waste your time people no wonder it was released straight to dvd. well thanks for reading xxx

oh but this is woeful. one good actor after another turns in lamentable dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. i like robert carlyle and joanne whalley is one of my favourite actresses, tom courtney can act well when pushed and david suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all wallowed around like fish in a barrel of watery gin. i swear courtney was inebriated, on painkillers or both. was there a good performance in the whole thing? well yes, david hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that, it can't be easy when "all around are losing theirs" so to speak, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director ( if there was one) i just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor ( other than paying the bills, obviously) i can't begin to say how disappointed i am in them. you should be ashamed of yourselves! any positives other than david hood the third... yes the aerial shots of london largely submerged were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story,if you'll forgive the expression, as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage. what's going on here? why are british film makers trying to imitate such characterless, spectacle driven, tabloid level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the americans. gritty realism, character integrity, the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel it and care... the family way, spring and port wine, get carter, the long good friday, trainspotting....don't get me wrong i like a bit of escapist hokum. the real "italian job" , the adventures of tom jones; but oh that it should come to this, there was more realistic drama in carry on camping.

there's something intriguing about disaster movies. the simple, primal premise can lead to several great stories. granted, most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with that.unfortunately, flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre. robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, even though screen time is split between different locations and characters. he gives a barely decent performance. as well, joanne whalley is very uneven. veteran actor tom courtenay (he played in doctor zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. i mean, his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. what an embarrassing performance for that man. the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: jessalyn gilsig, whom i thought might be there as a plot device/eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance. doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared.the script is really bad, confusing and cliché. some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.you've seen this story a thousand times. it employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you've seen in "outbreak", "armageddon", the poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others.the direction is awful. no sense of timing, nothing inspired. the shots are bland, dialog and action both fail to flow. editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess? without a doubt, this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) cgi. the human factor, the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over. scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done. the made-for-tv feel gives nausea. some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter? no problem, let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut/editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious way possible.the movie score is rather poor. all over the place, no timing.the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time. very much like they ran out of ideas. scrap that, you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place. must have ran out of budget.this is a really amateur job. i give it a 2 for using london as a location, which is a nice change, for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on london and the gates).do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one. this includes older classics like the towering inferno.

i absolutely love stand-up comedy. i love to hear the raw thoughts of the stand-up on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ****ing stupid that they had to share it with someone. there used to be stand-ups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to (rodney dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others (richard pryor). and then, there were the thought-provoking comics like george carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things.now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "mind of mencia," which, as i agree with most commentators here, is comedy central's horrid solution to the loss of "chappelle's show," but it does. carlos mencia spends half of the show doing stand-up bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. he tries to be all three of the above types of stand-ups. he makes a stage character, an every-day mexican named carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your run-of-the-mill normal guy. he then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. and then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view.carlos mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around:laugh.promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in stand-up. the best comedians, which, i fear, carlos mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. they talk universally, and ask you to laugh at absurdity, rather than with it, like mencia encourages. as he creates more skits or "real-life" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it. his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want (something that, as much as i hate to compare the two, was "chappelle's show's" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it---which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "dee dee dee!" this show is appropriately named. it is indeed a show about "the mind of mencia." it's mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. the show is tailor-made to give life lessons to its core audience, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to carlos mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!

yup, that's right folks, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television. if you want to watch a sad, lonely and unfunny hack comedian attempt to entertain the masses with a half hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your mildly retarded cousin commented on at the thanksgiving dinner table then this might be the show for you. this is billed as edgy comedy my friends but to be honest this makes tim allen look like richard pryor. avoid at all costs. unless you're a masochist.

...so where's my friggin trophy? i seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap. comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men. dah duh nah!! if you pay attention to the show, you'll notice that when mencia isn't stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits, he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor. you ever notice how people in buick's drive really slow? it's like dah duh nah! not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from mencia's distinct lack of talent. furthermore, mencia isn't even a "wetback" as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is, which makes him a fraud on top of it all.if anything good could be said about mencia, it's his effort. the man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, god knows he's trying.

i haven't watched this show in months, but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it. so maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time, although the commercials and the 4.2 rating on imdb aren't a good sign.it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelle's show. even mencia says so. and while i wasn't even that big a fan of chappelle's show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than mencia has ever been). mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale. if you can't see that, i guess there's just no hope for you. but to be fair, here are some examples: --mencia blatantly rips off chapelle's lil jon skit. just takes it.--"south park" makes an episode about scientology. one week later, mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists. bear in mind the joke isn't about scientologists, but about how much he's offended them on his show. when up to this point, he has never made a single scientology joke, ever.--after hurricane katrina, two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. weeks later, after millions of people have already seen this, mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time (the daily show would have been on something like that in a day). pathetic.even more annoying than the joke-stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming he's breaking down some sort of pc barrier (whatever) and that if you aren't laughing, you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race. yes, carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true, then why was chappelle's show so popular?). he constantly berates his audience for "not getting it" if he doesn't get enough laughs, and often repeats and explains his jokes, a technique most comedians stop using by age 14.the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. it's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier, more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money. his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central, which is baffling (again, it has a 4.2 rating on this site). where the hell are they getting these numbers?? comedy central tries to bill itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible, that will never be the case.

i thought "puppets making crank phone calls" was pretty low, but i don't believe that carlos mencia's show even qualifies as comedy. his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as many times as he possible can. i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before, but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun.mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle, and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. it is obvious right down to the rip of chapelle's intro (blues guys vs. mariachi band). however, mencia has absolutely *no* attitude, and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time. instead he sticks to a small number of hardly-shocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes "jokes" about immigration. every once in a while, he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like middle eastern cultures. these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old topics (such as 9/11), in a watered down, stand-up style, while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style. i think he's too afraid of really offending anyone, so it just makes the viewer feel awkward. he also beats jokes to death. if you've ever seen "why the f*** is this news?" you'll know what i'm talking about. it's funny at first, but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point. it's a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch.

this is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show i've ever seen. i'm confounded that this guy was given his own show. it smells of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable dave chapelle. he's a tip from ned's bag of comedy gold: is a punchline not funny? need to give it that extra push into hilarity? f***ing yell it at the top of your lungs. simple, no? and as an added bonus....finish half your jokes with...then you're re-tah-ded!! or duh-du-duuuuhhhh! oh man. so....funny. beaner...hilarious. wetback....does the laughter ever stop?to illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, i'll cite an example. mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild new orleans, because it's so close to the water. genius. the line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly. while a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take solace in, ned goes for the obvious. move the city. great. wait, is that funny? ned doesn't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. the hurricane didn't flood the city, ned. the levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars...and behold! they broke. i guess that's god's way of telling us we shouldn't be there. after all, he's got a seat in congress. what a fool.chapelle was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head. he was effortless at it, and at all points, we were laughing with him. while mencia talks about black people not being able to swim *yawn,* chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white supremesist. you don't have to be scathing to be edgy. you have to be original. mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes, thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities. except of course, with ned, he's laughing all too emphatically at the "retards." du-du-duuuuh.

this is one of the most ridiculous westerns that hollywood ever made. gary cooper plays 'reb hollister', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. he meets up with a moron named weatherby, played by leif erickson, who is a u.s. marshal with no knowledge of firearms. weatherby is on his way to dallas to see his fiancee, tonia robles, played by ruth roman. senor robles, tonia's father, has plenty of men, but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the marlow brothers. will marlow, played by raymond massey, has financed the loan on the robles estate, making things completely absurd. he even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due, simply because he feels like it.since weatherby is a boston boy who can't fight, since he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee, tonia, (just another instance of more plot nonsense. are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? wait a minute, this guy couldn't pass the written test either.) he switches identities with reb hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. reb takes the liberty of greeting weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss, while weatherby looks on like an idiot. gary cooper, hollywood's number one stud, is in fine form here as reb. before the movie's done, not only does he take weatherby's job, he steals his fiancee also, and ruth roman as tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump leif erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over.there isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a dud. and cooper's character is a complete heel to boot. the film also stars barbara payton as brant marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances, unfortunately, by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. i strongly suggest you pass this one up.

stylized hollywood westerns, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939, a larger budget applied, and this production its issue.gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times -- the displaced southerner, fast on the draw and firm with honor, though kinda easy going whenever possible. he plays blayde hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation. he wears a buckskin-fringed shirt and packs two ivory-handled six shooters. he speaks with a countrified accent -- "a feller could get hurt doin' this." (cf., "sergeant york.") the gang is led by sneering raymond massey, who buys and sells land, usually by underhanded means whenever possible. the gang includes steve cochran, who cannot play a westerner though he's very good at scum bags in general. the requisite woman is ruth roman, daughter of the mexican plantation owner, who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty.i don't think i'll bother too much with the plot. no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention. as in any 1939 western, it's labyrinthine. everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets.everything is retro. the plot, the dialog, the wardrobe, even the music. the score is by warner's stalwart max steiner. he's the guy that scored "king kong." that was 1932. this movie was released in 1950.cooper's name, by the way -- "blayde hollister" -- prompted me to look through the records of the raca -- the real american cowboy associaton -- to see if that name cropped up in their archives, which date from the beginning of time to february 4th, 1911, when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. there has never been a real cowboy with the name blayde. hollister, yes, but not blayde. as a matter of fact, there is no record of any real cowboy named wade, luke, cole, or matt either. the most popular names for genuine cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were clarence, mortimer, noble, nebukadnezzar, plautus, pinchbeck, and hortense.if this movie had been released in 1939, it would have been routine. in 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.

kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill, now add mine. i think the script could have been saved by better acting, and the acting by a better script. together, it was difficult to watch, and i don't flinch from such subject matter.sigourney was the best part (i thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre) but even she lagged. can't blame her, who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director and/or editor. the whole movie had an "okay, that's good enough, let's move on" feel to it, when i know there was more to be mined from the actors and the script, which did have some good lines and some interesting themes.i don't think this counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where sigourney marches up to her son's supposed tormentor's house and has this look on her face and i thought "that's the face of someone who is overacting what it's like to see someone living in a mobile home" and sure enough, next shot, meant to shock us i'm sure, bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house, like hers.as many other posters have pointed out, there are so many better movies with similarly airy scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better -- "celebration" probably being the ultimate example that i've seen.

i just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that, in light of recent dramas such as these, the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. i would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counter-productive this conclusion is, even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree. but, instead, i realized that these films have made the very determination of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life (much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle), supplanting it instead with the "reality" of how things actually are. that in fact, what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional, but in fact, a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along, but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus, have ignored or at least denied.only problem is, that too many films have been trying to make this point. and by doing so in nearly identical form. when i had read the synopsis for the film, i immediately thought of 'ice storm.' while watching the depressing lifelessness of the travis family, which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating, i immediately recalled 'american beauty.' and, in some regards, the interactions between the parents and the middle child, tim, i drew similarities from 'igby goes down.' 'imaginary heroes' may be a novel experience, maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that, as said before, is often not permitted to exist in the films of family (which is idiotic to think anyways, considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like 'ordinary people' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that). but, to the well-versed viewer, these films may offer nothing new. they have in fact, become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to out-do the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family (and here, it extends to neighbors and friends). in fact, 'imaginary heroes,' the latest in this genre (i do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a 'genre'), crams so many disasters and surprises into one family, that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host. it is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion. the youngest son knew this, the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his all-star son. and it's not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man.granted, it is no less entertaining (to some extent, for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while), and the performances are quite good, especially by sigourney weaver and jeff daniels. but, i sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling familial relationships (which coincidentally or not always seem to be upper-middle class white suburban families) intend to offer something new by way of material and insight. i should see no distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.

this wretched psychodrama uses every shabby device in the book to wheedle attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, are not worthy of any notice at all, let alone two precious hours of filmgoers' time.as in robert redford's "ordinary people" (a superb film that, in comparison, clearly shows up the vacuity of "heroes"), a late teenage boy has died, leaving his family in the throes of bereavement. in this case, the death was a suicide, an event that nearly always poisons the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. we follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months.the father (jeff daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually mute, usually drunken stiff who secretly takes leave from his job for months, sits instead on a park bench all day, and insists on setting a full plate of food at the deceased son's place for every meal. he treats everyone else in the family with unerring nastiness. he sees his doctor regularly but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never comes up.the mother (sigourney weaver) yells at the neighbor woman, among others, gets busted when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) at a head shop (what adult in reality would ever try such a dumb stunt?), and, near the end, swoons into coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer (she's a heavy smoker). ms. weaver has a few flip lines but generally behaves too unintelligently to merit much empathy. it's not that there aren't people out there who behave in these silly ways when severely stressful circumstances arise. but why make a film of such drivel? what can anyone learn from this pair's conduct? the deceased's older sister (michelle williams) is away at college and all too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. the younger brother (played by emile hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. his suffering is genuine, its causes multifold, and his conduct is coherent within the circumstances. but hirsch's character is too soft spoken, too morose and beaten down, to carry the movie. the other bit players, subtexts and cutesy, unreal dialogue don't help.the suicide theme is echoed in an almost nonchalant manner in the case of two other minor characters. so what is the writer-director, dan harris, trying to say about this subject? that it isn't a serious matter? why jeff daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as written in this screenplay is something only his therapist might possibly be able to answer. avoid this dog. instead rent redford's classic. my rating: 4/10 (c-). (seen on 2/17/05). if you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.

this was a character's movie. the plot wasn't that hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well-acted. the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. i say that loosely, because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too, they edited the movie pretty poorly. the acting on all parts was very good, particularly emile hirsch as the surviving, confused son. the characters were all very interesting and i didn't mind watching them until late in the film, when it just seemed to drag. my big complaint, however, was the story. the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot. however, it really wasn't. it was something that happened at the start of the story, but then everything went every which way. then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread. the other thing was that the big plot twists, of which there were plenty, were never really explained or built up to, but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field. in fairness, the ending was very, very cool. but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (the half that wasn't padding) was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive. which reminds me... there was a "poem" in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself. i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted, word for word, from that very same song. i dunno, this was a movie i had hope for, and they really, really dropped the ball.

===========big spoiler================================== this is a terrible movie with no likable characters. so many clichés and senseless scenes. it needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left. please save your two hours. the only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. the description read "moments of dark comedy". perhaps i missed those when i blinked. the horrible characters start right with the funeral. the funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide? then the father makes digs at the only son left? right at the funeral? how is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with sigourney weaver's character is the bad guy for telling the husband? the father doesn't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist. the movie tries to shove every dramatic cliché possible into one movie: father over-driving athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide, the son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, child conceived via affair but raised as husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illness, etc, etc, etc. do not waste your 2 hours.

viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same. story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt (kip pardue) who was a very promising high school swimmer. ben (jeff daniels) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim (emile hirsch) as well as matt but he does communicate (of some sort) to his mother sandy (sigourney weaver) who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it.*****spoiler alert***** sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail. she doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim's body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work. after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family.this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on "x2" and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story (for me) just has too many things thrown in. the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimentation with homosexuality, and a life threatening illness. if all those scenarios weren't enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards tim. while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another i must admit that i didn't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that. everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch. weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. harris shows he can be a good writer/director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived.

the somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way (by acting out) but that dad is morose and blaming himself. writer-director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then lays all the story-points out in the most obvious terms: suicide! secrets! gay shame! family sickness! ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow, harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary, sentimental fashion. sigourney weaver's bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she's a joy--that is, until harris gives her a make-over (complete with sensible new hairstyle). it's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** from ****

combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times. looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script; not to mention albert brooks' excellent broodish character portrayal. but man of the year can't come close by comparison. it has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable.the premise initially seemed very promising. put a jon stewart-like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens. this independent runner is tom dobbs (robin williams, rv), a successful tv personality who is pressured into running by his audience. along with him comes his manager jack (christopher walken, click), and his writer eddie (lewis black). seeming to have very little chance at a successful run, tom dobbs amazingly wins the election.but did he? eleanor green (laura linney, the exorcist of emily rose) is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. she finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney alan (jeff goldblum, independence day). poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and/or kill eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. but eleanor is able to get to president-elect dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming, too). dobbs goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world, thus removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company ...oh, and saving ms. green's life.does any of this sound funny? the comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward. robin williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him.the message of the film is interesting and debatable, too: that special interest owns presidential candidates. i'm sure there's substantial truth in this, and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could. if you wanted to make a comedy about you could. but man of the year isn't it.

i was aware of man of the year's critical pans and unremarkable gross, but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months.what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. surprising is an understatement considering barry levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in good morning vietnam and wag the dog) and robin williams' obvious comic gifts. robin williams, in fact, is mysteriously underused. on the "making of" featurette that comes with the dvd, barry levinson talked about how sometimes he let robin williams improvise off the script, like it was some naughty secret of his. umare you really that much of a moron, barry levinson? whenever you have robin williams in your film and want to use him for his comic abilities (basically, every movie he's been in other than insomnia or one hour photo), don't cage him within a script. let him ad-lib whatever he wants because he is the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him and his uncontained comic rants can instantly raise the bar on any mediocre movie like rv or patch adams. what i found even more baffling in his failure to make use of robin williams was that back in 1987, levinson used this exact formula to perfection in good morning vietnam, injecting robin williams' bursts of comic zaniness into a war picture to make a resounding political piece.so the film isn't as much of a laugh-fest as it could be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone. if the film had potential to work as anything, it might have made one of those thrillers from the mid-'90s in the style of the pelican brief, the fugitive, or one of those jack ryan films. its plot centered around an employee at a silicon valley company uncovering a glitch in a system that reveals that the country elected the wrong president and the efforts of the ceos to eliminate her before the secret gets out, so if you replaced robin williams with some harrison-ford-type actor, or perhaps even harrison ford himself, added a couple more explosions, and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go. i'll never really know and it's not worth it to try to find out.

such a highly-anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take. very, very hard to swallow...all of it. it didn't have an ounce of believability anywhere. and when you don't have a rose, you don't have a show.bette midler seemed born to play this part. yet, all she was able to produce was a cute, funny, glitzy, trademark bette midler...weighed down with all the familiar midlerisms. roz russell has nothing to worry about. she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose (of film, anyway).i thought midler was really going to put it across this time...to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time...like she did in "the rose." but, no, she played it safe. she played herself. she made rose a total dinner-theatre cartoon. even her songs were uninspired. it was maddening to watch, knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money-making schtick. she showed promise only once in this "gypsy" and that was with "rose's turn." but, by then it was too little, too late.a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose, you know there's trouble in river city.a huge, huge letdown.

the only people i would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf, although i'm sure a sadomasochist would get a kick out of it. this film had nothing; no acting, terrible music, awful script- only the power to suck any happiness from your soul. you may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer inanity, and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself. firstly, i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable. secondly, i only made it without gnawing off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. the problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes, and that was a fatal error on my behalf. i normally like films to leave you with something by the end, but all this did was take..... for the sake of your sanity do not watch this film.

worst.film.ever nothing more needs to be said. aaron carter is utterly repellent and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately. it really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end. i wish i could be more eloquent in describing the movies many (oh so many) flaws however i cant be bothered/get too angry to form proper sentences. in short i absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad its good" kinda way...it was unadulterated drek.gavin

this movie started out as a quite decent-looking film but it never really kicked off, instead it became predictable and even a bit silly. some scenes were quite well made, the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch, but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive. and more importantly, its not scary at all! it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting..to be frank, the actors weren't all that great either, no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days..overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it, it wont last long until its already forgotten.the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores, but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10. if you still want some japanese horror, i would suggest you watch ju-on instead!

ok, let me start off by saying this isn't a horrible movie by any means. it's just not good. i recall one poster saying the acting isn't campy it's just nuanced. no. i've seen nuanced japanese and asian acting. i'm sorry, you're wrong. this is camp.the characters are totally unsympathetic, the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless. the writing is bad. i'm fine with suspending disbelief, i'm fine with not having everything handed to me in terms of plot. but this movie has no plot. one reviewer stated "this movie is set in a small town where people are going nuts over vortexes and spirals." that's not a blurb, that's the entire freaking film. congratulations, i've just saved you nearly an hour and a half. there is nothing more to it. no character development, no plot development, no explanations, no resolution. and not even the "acceptable within the realm of j-horror" lack of resolution. just nothing.in addition, the musical score is done by someone who obviously wasn't actually watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause whiplash. cognitive dissonance is one thing and done well it can be brilliant (see dark water), but here it just seems as if the score was designed to go with another movie all together.the best example i can give is it's as if the japanese remade evil dead without any of the clever bits or good acting. it just falls flat. it's j-horror without the horror.

stinger starts '3 months ago' on the submarine the ss newark where genetic experiments have gone awry & the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions... jump to 'camp pendleton' a couple of months later where general ashford (james cagnard) brief's lieutenant williams (john miranda) on his mission to board the newark & assist genetic scientist dr. carly ryan (michelle meadows), before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists & marines are on-board the newark & are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from dr. mike thompson (casey clark) who doesn't make much sense. it's not long before the scorpions attack, first to fall is lt. williams so sergeant sam harmon (christopher persson) is promoted & takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety & end the menace of the giant scorpions forever...this sweedish america co-production was directed by martin munthe & he also handled the cinematography & i thought this was a strictly by-the-numbers uninspiring creature feature. it's early into the new year & stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster/creature/insect type film i've seen in 2007, hopefully things can only get better... the script by mat nastos is incredibly clichéd & gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably aliens (1986), lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine, there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film, there's the scientists including a blonde sweedish one to try & explain it all & the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life & the final ingredient being the monster/alien/insect or whatever, in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers. yeah, it's all here, unfortunately stinger isn't an aliens if you get what i mean. it's a touch long at over 100 minutes & it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace & as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdb...director munthe doesn't distinguish himself, it's not scary, there's a lack of atmosphere & the action scenes are dull & unexciting. there's not many scorpion attacks & it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs, the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse that's for sure. i mean that's not to say the effects in stinger are good but i've seen worse. there isn't much blood or gore, there's some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads & someone is ripped in half. the only clever & amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions... however there was a moment which had me groaning & tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine's circuitry & get the lights working by hitting the power supply/computer boards with a hammer & it works as well...technically stinger is average at best & there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous. stinger was shot in stockholm in sweeden if your interested. the acting was poor & there's nothing else to say.stinger isn't a great film & it isn't a great horror film either, i can't recommend it at all but i've seen worse. if you liked stinger (unlikely) you might like the similarly themed 'giant scorpions on the loose' films tail sting (2001) or scorpius gigantus (2006) (just as unlikely).

at the very beginning, the look at a control panel that reads "8 miles of the cost of california", and no, i didn't misspell that, they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast. these people must have been morons.it's good if you're into terrible movies, but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever. the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever.wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch. how these folks made any money off this is beyond me.

i'm a fan of low budget b-movies and campy horror flicks, but this was too much, even for me.if you can get past the weak plot, the cheesy effects and the uninspired acting, then the horrible writing will kill you, or you'll wish it would. the dialog was most likely written by high school stoners, who thought that saying "sir, yes sir" over and over again, made these guys sound more military.the characters were all the typical cardboard stereotypes: gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho other guy with sensitive side, evil scientist with secret agenda (bald or course), bitchy brainy chick who would be hot if she tried too, dumb sexy chick with vital piece of information, idiot "genius" nerd, random other sorta military dudes who die soon enough, and spoiler character alert, crazy scientist who was in charge "until something went horribly wrong" oh yeah, i almost forgot, there is a secret military (navy?) submarine, sitting on the ocean floor, 5 minutes from hq (or so it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and dead bodies. your mission is vague and poorly defined.....if you watch this, don't say you weren't warned.

some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everybody. two months later, some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the sub to retrieve their cargo. after finding 200 dead bodies, the marine commander tells the doctor "i need to know if there's anything down here that could be a danger to my men". uh, gee...ya think? she refuses to tell him what is down there, citing "need to know". yup, that pretty well sizes it up. one of the scientists is apparently some sort of idiot savant - real heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. he's given the task of fixing the lights. he finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire, and shrieks like a banshee. then he does it again. then he takes a hammer and smashes the control panel to pieces, which causes all the lights on the submarine to start working.and so it goes. apparently this was made in sweden; i'm not sure if the swedes have a really weird sense of humor or if they're just really awful movie makers. i'm inclined to think they're awful movie makers. if you guessed that there's a huge explosion at the end of this thing, well, sorry, but that's on a need-to-know basis, so i can't tell you.if you've absolutely got to see a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest tail sting, which is a cheesy and fun movie about scorpions on a plane, or bugs, which is a fairly descent b movie about scorpions in a tunnel. look at this movie as an absolute last resort. oh, it's watchable, it's hard to turn it off just because of the sheer lunacy of it, but that's about all it's got going for it.

even by the standards of most b-movies, this movie is by far the worst i've ever seen. the graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable, including the one scene where they board the mini-sub, and the "water" looks like its frozen in place. the problems with this film are so numerous that i'll just stop here with the details. needless to say, i kid you not when i say that even uwe toilet boll himself could do a better job. avoid this movie at all cost, there are other b grade movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way of passing the time by.

did beavis and butthead make this movie? it is just that bad. truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of "bad" vs. "good" in the wine world. did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir. the camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long. this is not insightful journalism. what i got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing, for example, that the mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. okay, that is a good start. so, how do these wines compare? does the mondavi napa cab taste like their italian wines. we never find out because no one in the film comments on this. instead, there is a lot of innuendo about nazi's and fascism. well, those things don't grow grapes. hmmmm.

this film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates (the american producer, mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make "the perfect wine"--and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. to some, this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $50 or more for an everyday wine) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing. i truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business. sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what's happened with beers (with giants like unibrew and anheiser-busch), food (mcdonalds), shopping (european shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from american ones) and mega-stores (like walmart/asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of "the little guys". so i definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers. however, with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus, the film simply became too big a chore to watch and i lost interest. an 80-90 minute focused film would have been much more effective--especially since the average viewer is not an oenophile (that's the high-brow word for a "wine aficionado").on the very positive side, the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking. plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. however, despite choosing a good style of documentary making, the film simply goes on way, way, way too long and ended up making a very dull film.

an interesting period picec showing us what was amazing in 1938. gosh, ma, a fake accident ring suing for $25,000!!! i guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money. the acting would amount to pure 21st century ham. nice to see the president as a hard-working newcomer.

honest young insurance agent ronald reagan (as eric gregg) is optimistic, but poor. his wife, scheming sheila bromley (as nona gregg), longs for the finer things in life. describing herself as "not weighted down with tons of righteousness," ms. bromley begins to spend more money than mr. reagan earns. bromley obtains the finer things in life, but puts the couple in debt. bromley is a fun shrew.handsome reagan attracts other women, like perky clerk gloria blondell (as patricia carmody); but, he doesn't indulge. to pay the bills, bromley gets tangled up in the insurance fraud racket - which helps get her husband fired. an unemployed reagan seems to be tempted into a life of crime - will he remain straight up, or get crooked? clinton rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene.*** accidents will happen (1938) william clemens ~ ronald reagan, sheila bromley, gloria blondell

warning!! this review may contain spoilers. the back of the box is misleading. it says all this crap about kids telling ghost stories, which they do, but then it implies that they will all be killed by some killer in the woods. this doesn't happen. the stories they tell are a little interesting, specifically the one with the dog and all that licking, but most are rather boring, monsters in the woods, some mute girl, and the main one, the whole movie.

the movie had an interesting surprise. somewhat psychologically gripping. and the makers could have ended it tastefully without making it just another of a rash of movies put out by hollywood promoting homosexuality and/or other sexual deviances. this could have ended with a "pay-off", but there were other motives behind the pen. what torques me off is that the mud slung in your face after you've seen the whole movie. like the disappointing "the talented mr. ripley". yeah sure, i'm just another puritan. this gay content tarnished the whole film. i wouldn't positively judge a movie for artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote an ulterior political motivation, more so for this.

this is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced. nothing happens in this film, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. the plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger that they pick up from the high way. the couple invite the stranger to stay with them, because he is homeless. at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right? no they just kiss and thats it. also, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even suspense. makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script!!!!

it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting. it happens quite often. not only is dark harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise. a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble.some movies build tension by building the story. dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it. i was hoping that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. it never does. also, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. they may act one way in one scene, but then act a completely different way in another scene. at first, you think that they are merely out of character, but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. they are just props for the final twist. the final ten minutes try to be shocking. instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long.this isn't one of those low-budget gems. it's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.

this is a classic b type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see. it started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller, but i was mistaking. all movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller, but that doesn't happen. it runs slowly and peacefully til the end, with nothing interesting in it. just the ending was unexpected and original, but that's it. vote: 2.5 out of 10. oh, one more thing. why is this movie rated r anyway???

please don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture. the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die-hard fan of erika elaniak, but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap. i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this. they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci-fi dracula movie, but it quickly works out to be a farce about van helsing's great-great (you get the point) grandson, here ironically for one last show-down between himself and dracula.the movie also tries to make a political statement, i believe, when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is, that they have not been taught about him and don't understand when they see a cross. could have done a lot more with this idea. it's a shame it turned out the way it did.

it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless, that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores. in fact, i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it. acting: your kidding right. direction: no. a plot: no. this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie, this is often the case with movies of this genre, but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth. this movie is so empty, that it cannot even suit that purpose. i have to give this a -1/10, three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated. i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it. i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is. no one should ever watch this for any reason again.

i won't reiterate what so many others have said about this film; i'll try to add a few new points. the coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the blondie song "no exit" in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire (it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song). casper van dien is no worse than brad pitt and is actually more handsome. and really what does anyone go to a brad pitt movie for other than eye candy? same here, although this is poorly filmed (check out "starship troopers" instead). and of course udo kier, after having played dracula in the morrissey/warhol film, has little more than a cameo. enjoy it if you can.

this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen! me and my husband own over 600 dvds, most of which are sci-fi and horror b-movies that aren't top quality, but still entertaining. dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all! the writing was horrific, and the acting was even worse. it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie, because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals. we thought surely it must get better...we were wrong. i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again!!! when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like "uh..is that it?" the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more, but they ran over their apparent $500.00 budget and were like "oh, crap...we are broke..end it now...quick..roll credits!"

hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie. i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast. shoddy special effects. i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio. a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product. i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor. their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble don't they read scripts. i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing. i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day.

wow, there's a lot of venom directed at this movie, and a lot of it is deserved, but it's not the worst movie of all time. (that's probably "zoolander".)anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk, or just in the mood for a "b-minus- minus" movie that you can make fun of, this may be your cup of tea.yes, as others said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an updating of the bram stoker novel. two of the main characters are named van helsing and mina, the ship is the demeter, and they're in the carpathian galaxy. you later find that van helsing is a descendant of the original, and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with dracula. suuuuuuuuuuure.oh yeah, and to add to the originality, this "spooky ghost ship" movie has another character named ash. sound familiar?there's paper-thin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and coolio and tom lister talking 20th century black slang. but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending. if that's what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours have been a waste.like i said, it you want a dumb movie to play "mystery science theater" with, and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the "great vegetable rebellion" episode of lost in space, then you may find this diverting. otherwise, put a stake in it, it's done.

well it is about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies!! but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men are still calling each other brothers, and getting high, stoned, fighting etc.. common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick! babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they're from baywatch share close quarters with the captian and crew. crippled people still require wheelchairs to move, no fancy cures, implants, or robotic legs. dracula still looks and acts gay. need i go on... in short this move was shot on a typical sci-fi set low budget props, actors, and no real special effects to speak of. the beginning, the middle, and the ending was pathetic. i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for.

worst. movie. ever made. ever. i have no words to say about it.. other then it truly had no point, no plot, no... anything. sheer crap!!! i don't know how everyone in the movie didn't shoot them shelves after watching it.... .... .... ... .. i love vampire flicks and mysteries, and alternate abstract outside the box films, and.... this was non of those. i mean what the crap!!! i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don't know, and i just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it... bottom line.. i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs. thats the only thing i got from this film. please don't watch this... i mean for a " sultry sensual vampire flick" there wasn't even the to be expected nudity you'd get from a vamp flick. anyway back to my point.... this movie blows. go set yourself on fire instead.... .. ..

pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone goth about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk. the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesn't go anywhere. worse are the vague pronouncements in voice over from one of the characters. it seems to herald a more serious, more meaningful film, but i don't think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly. there isn't a great deal to say, people talk, take drugs have visions...they talks some more. its not bad so much as pointless and dull. the dull is the sin here and the reason you'll want to avoid this.

bled starts as young female artist sai (sarah ferooqui) meets a mysterious yet charming man named renfield (jonathan oldham) & they end up back at her studio apartment where he gives her the bark of some sort of tree which is used as a hallucinogenic drug when melted down. sai quickly becomes hooked as she is whisked into an alternate fantasy reality which involve vampiric creatures. sai's photographer friend royce (chris ivan cevic) becomes concerned about her as she drifts further from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug, can royce her kick the drug or will it end up ruining her life & why did the mysterious renfield get her addicted to the stuff in the first place & do the elaborate fantasy dream like trips have any significance?co-produced & directed by christopher hutson this anaemic arty vampire flick is pretty much 95 minutes of tedium & is throughly deserving of all the bad comments. the script was written by the interestingly named sxv'leithan essex (how the hell do you even pronounce that anyway?) who is also credited as production designer & his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in bled, i would guess that the makers set out to make a very serious fantasy based horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction & date rape drug at it's core. the majority of the film is spent on the drug issue with sai's initial introduction to the drug, how great the first time was & how she becomes hopelessly addicted which eventually destroys her, her life & her friends lives. it's never explained where she keeps getting this drug from as renfield only gives her a little bit during their initial meeting but hey, who cares? the first twenty odd minutes of bled are really boring & dull, the following hour or so aren't much better before a mess of a final ten minutes which involve a vampiric monster & renfield making a reappearance. the moral elements are patronising, the fantasy elements seem like an afterthought & the horror is none existent. there's also the dialogue which is awful, every sentence tries to be profound, have loads of hidden depth & just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes tiresome to listen to.the concept of the film is terrible & so is the execution as there's absolutely no gore or violence to speak of & the entire thing is set inside an apartment that doesn't appear to have any lights. the fantasy setting looks a little better but it's sparsely seen & underused. there are no scares here, no atmosphere & to make matters even worse the makers have decided to used muted very faded colours which i just hate & find annoying, what's wrong with a nice colourful image? it seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a film cool or adds atmosphere which it most certainly doesn't, more often than not it just makes your film look dull & drab as evidenced here with bled.this probably had a low budget & was shot in los angeles & it has reasonable production values but it's all so dull. the acting didn't impress me, i didn't care for or about anyone which is never a good sign.bled is a terrible vampire film that goes for psychological horror as well as physical with all sorts of parallels to real life dug addiction & what it can do to little or no effect because the whole thing is so dull. there might be an audience for a film such as this but considering the other comments not that big a one.

what on earth? like watching an episode of neighbours after drinking two bottles of cough medicine- nightmarish and making no sense at all. i was waiting for the clever part where everything fits into place and saves the film. maybe it was there and i just missed it, or was lost on me.my strongest suspicion is that it is a thinly veiled attempt to market a new drug thats about to hit the streets. i wouldn't say "don't watch it" but i will say its pretty poor on every level- like am dram in high def. whack. unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. then it's just dandy.

simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her,on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. theacting was horrible. the script was uninspired. this was a movie that kept contradicting itself. the film was sloppy and unoriginal. its not like i was expecting a good film. just something to give me a jump or two. this did not even do that. he worst thing is that, the more i think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding. a real shame really, as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere...i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4/10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent, this film really should have delivered far more.

i rented this movie today... worst movie ever. it was a total waste of time and a horrible story. the acting was horrible, especially by the actress of "sai". she was so bad it was ridiculous. i can't tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place. i can't even get my mind wrapped around just how awful and pointless this whole movie was. i'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it.if you're looking for a good vampire/horror flick.. this is not the movie for you. move right along! it's a waste of time and money. heck, i wouldn't even download this movie if someone paid me.this movie is so bad it doesn't even deserve a "1". i wish i could give it a "0"!

bled is a very apt title for this as you watch it you will feel your life being bled from you . the cliché in horrors is about people doing exactly what they shouldn't ( going down into the basement or going up into the attic) then the trouble ensues take heed then don't watch this film .show the brains that victims in horror movies never do stay clear do not enter .and if you need anymore incentive this film? is as bad as the worst uwe boll film i mean ,the house of the dead bad. i have often thought about entering a review of a film on i.m.d.b. and ,after watching some based on the comments herein ,i discovered i guess everyone's entiled to his/her opinion. please trust me on mine

once again, i fell for it, in my roots i crave a fun and gory horror film, even a vampire one. even if it's stupid, as long as i get my fun gore in the mix, i'm a happy camper, it doesn't take much. so i saw the cover of "bled" over at hollywood video and was kind of curious what it was about, it looked kind of interesting, so i decided to rent it. why? why do i always fall for it? not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction i needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity, but i was bored out of mind. this movie has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! i'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times i actually turned the movie off.an artist meets a vampire, i think, dunno, i'm still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was reinfield, so i'm assuming maybe he's a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out? i think, i dunno. anyways, he thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness, so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? i think, i dunno. so her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too, i think, i dunno. so after they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, i think, i dunno, and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing. i think, i dunno. but a couple of the girls really end up being vampires? i think, i dunno.sorry for all the "i dunno's", this is possibly one of the worst reviews i'm going to write, but that's because this movie was just awful, boring, and confusing. i love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are waiters looking for that "big break". not too smart that they fell in the cliché of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, in this case, they really should have read the script. because the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, i really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store. this possibly could have been an interesting movie with it's concept of a different dimension, but why did they pick this director to display his "creativity" if he even has any? this was a bad movie, just stay away.1/10

this movie is probably one of 3 worst movies made in history. i rented this by chance, without reading reviews, and wow, do i regret it. really has no plot, doesn't really follow the vampire genre. just plain god awful. watching this movie will taint your enthusiasm for vampire movies. i felt like the writer/director/producer went on this drug binge and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film. whole time i wanted the movie to end.. but the ending was even more whacked. if this review can save just one person from watching this crap, i felt my time spent on registration and writing this review was well worth it.

this movie is just crap, i cant put it differently. since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap. the story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, pretty much everything sucks. i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing, i can't believe how somebody produced this thing.it's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream/reality experience. the development of the movie is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is... doesn't exist, everything seems like a big joke. maybe that's what they tried to do, but i sincerely doubt it. i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired, it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life (and i've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) please, make yourselves a favor and do not watch this. p.s. it's also full of clichés! p.s. 2 bad script, bad directing, bad cinematography. p.s. 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone.

this film is a disaster from beginning to end. 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from hercules & the haunted world and hercules & the captive women badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete rip-off. i'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them, re-edited and re-dubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin. these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the sword & sandal genre back in the 1960s.there is one memorable scene in the new footage and it's the one when hercules fights with the bad hercules. the fight is albeit cool and giovanni cianfriglia, who plays antaius, definitely stands out. he makes a memorable nemesis to herc. but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a day.avoid at all cost!

this movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group "the band" in that singer/ keyboardist richard manuel appears in several scenes. it looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by richard's looks. interestingly, jones would later act with the band's levon in a considerably better film "coal miner's daughter." anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch art film. alas, the famously sensitive manuel would commit suicide. i've never heard how he ended up in a movie. four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad film "man outside."

a girl is looking for her soul mate-- this movie was very strange-- lots of sequences that look like an hallucinations. tommy lee jones is the only stable one in the picture. it was hard to figure out what the director was trying to say-- most of the time the main character is dressed in weird clothes and makeup. a weird combination of reality and madness.

i bought this dvd as part of a set of 50 "historic classics." it's hardly a classic, and as the plot was updated to the time of its release, is not historic either. the actual title on the dvd is "indecent," and additionally subtitled "the private life of becky sharp." myrna loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is saddled with an awful script and trite dialogue. as with many early talkies, and especially ones made by smaller studios, there is little skill demonstrated by the cast and crew. loy does wear a few gowns that are quite stylish, but her costumes and make-up in the later scenes are overdone. the one saving grace is a tolerable performance by billy bevan, who plays one of her many suitors

there are those who gripe that this is not the opera, but then they don't quibble with the film of cabaret that was not the original show either. all films of musicals/operas are and have to be "adaptations" or they don't work. cabaret took more liberties with the original show than did the film of porgy and bess and yet it kept its original integrity, reworking the material, and is judged an artistic success. the same holds true for porgy and bess- it reworked the opera into a dialogue/song libretto because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few echt filmed operas. it would have been economical suicide for preminger to produce a film of the opera - it would have lost a fortune for the goldwyn studios.that said, this is a fine adaptation. the acting is excellent, the oscar winning scoring of andre previn is magnificent, as is the choral singing, and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. robert mcferrin (dad of popular musician bobby mcferrin) dubbed porgy and adele addison dubbed bess. while sammy davis jr. sang his own songs in the film, his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album, so cab calloway recorded his numbers (spectacularly) for that release. brock peters' bass/baritone is extraordinary and pearl bailey is her own unique self. diahann carroll, although a singer of fine note, has the small role of clara which required a high soprano, so old reliable marni nixon dubbed her singing.the gershwin estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights, although the dramatic rights are in the public domain. this sort of hate feud held up the video release of carousel for almost fifteen years (although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation) and is currently preventing both porgy and bess and annie get your gun from being released on video.of all the stage productions given film versions, it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video. only a campaign of letters to the gershwin estate in ny might loosen up the reserve.

saw this on french tv today and was most disappointed ! the film starts off reasonably well but nothing is elucidated and at the end we are no farther forward than in the beginning. as to seeing the husband for the murder of his wife, this is just not plausible. you need tangible proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. in this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible. remember the old adage "innocent until proved guilty". the fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her. so i really don't know what kind of point this film was trying to make. the outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the spectator. so quite frankly, viewing it is a complete waste of time. after all, a film must be entertaining .... this is completely untrue in the case of this one and i suggest it be irrevocably consigned to the dustbin where it belongs !

as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a homo in it. chicken tikka masala is churning on in the background as i write this. i gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before i found myself involuntarily shouting - like a tourrette's sufferer -"this is the sh**test film i have ever seen". we're just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding. father seems to be taking it quite well. an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have livened the film up a bit. and made it funnier. i didn't particularly like beautiful thing, for example, but could at least see why other people did. it was made with some professionalism and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines. the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognisable jokes. the nearest this movie got to being funny (at least in its first 53 mins) was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead "look at her with her legs wide open - she's like the mersey tunnel." completely witless and i didn't crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq (who perhaps works in a chip shop) enjoying it.i'd imagine it's some lottery-funded atrocity. if not i can at least console myself with the fact that the backers will lose a substantial amount of money as even a low-budget british film will still set someone back a couple of million. seriously, if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and, on going back to his place to make sweet love, i found a copy of this in his dvd collection ("man, i love this film") i'd probably kick him in the nuts and leave forthwith. and this from someone who's gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love. oh lord i hate this film.

for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the british indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. as written by roopesh parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. harmage singh kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of keystone cop tactics.jimi (chris bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack (peter ash) and they live with jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt vanessa (sally bankes) and sally's chubby daughter hannah (katy clayton). jimi's family is visited by the patel family from delhi who bring their beautiful daughter simran (jinder mahal) to england to find a husband. jimi's parents (saeed jaffrey and jamila massey) and his grandmother (zohra sehgal) decide simran is the girl for jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of indian ways - without consulting jimi. jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages jack and infuriates vanessa. hannah tells a 'little lie' to simran (that she is jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. when jimi's parents visit jimi's house they discover the drunken vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually decide that for jimi's happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a 'granddaughter' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for jimi and vanessa. jimi convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and jimi, terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents, includes jack as his best man. at the wedding the truth comes out and to jimi's surprise his family adapts to jimi's true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful.the cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances: chris bisson and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship (the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); sally bankes provides most of the laughs as vanessa; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in indian movies. this is not a bad film - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters.

the plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway. how can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of india - a story like this writes itself. i'll watch most anything, but this was unwatchable. the sad thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film. vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and jack was great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. saeed jeffrey, who was exceptional in my beautiful landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring. the saving grace was really the background music, which made it ok to laugh at the film, instead of with the film, or not at all. there are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies. i give a lot of low budget movies a pass, but this shouldn't have been made, or should have been made by someone else.

another bad spanish picture. this is very baaaad. i only save the photography and the music of josé nieto. the rest of the film is the worst i've seen in years. paz vega is horrible. don't see it.

another pretentious film from vicente aranda. if "juana la loca" shinned of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar lópez de ayala), but "carmen" is boring and full of topics (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness due to passion, sierra nevada gangs, "toreros",...)obviously paz vega is a pretty woman, but about its talent there're more doubts, and sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible. the script is weak and and aranda's presumptuous character influences the entire film. with these ingredients the result could not be good.not the worst film i've seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.

dull acting, weak script...worst spanish movie in years...i wasattracted by the (naked) beauty of paz vega, but as an actressshe's useless, you almost can't understand what she's saying...about the story there's not much coherent to say...we heard of itbefore, but as this is a "modern carmen" we find a few changes: -the french soldier is now a basque soldier. -merimee himself is a character in the story. -carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous"matador" and she can speak fluent basque...can anyone understand this mess?

upon renting this, i wasn't expecting to be blown away. in fact, i knew it was going to be horrible. it was just seeing how horrible it really was. that's what comes with low budget horror."snakes on a train", not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "snakes on a plane" with samuel l. jackson, is about a woman who is put under a mayan curse that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within. her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman that lives across the border, so she and her companion stowaway onto a train bound for los angelas. throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensues.come to think of it, though, the story isn't half bad. isn't half good, either.the acting in this film rivals that of a sci-fi original, if not worse. trust me, it's horrible. the snakes were another problem. they were supposed to be rattlers, i guess, but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that gets really annoying.the gore effects on the other hand, while not on the tom savini level, were actually pretty good.and another thing, the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie. i'm not going to talk about it here, so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself.

snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo (a.j. castro) & alma (julia ruiz) cross the boarder into the us, they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles. however alma's family didn't approve of her & brujo's relationship & placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes, ain't life a b*tch? as the snakes pour out of alma's mouth & slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment...edited & directed by the mallachi brothers (although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a pseudonym, peter mervis) one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap, it's as simple as that really. it seems the entire film was set-up & made to cash in on the samuel l. jackson cult flick snakes on a plane (2006) by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in ripping-off big budget hollywood flicks & that style of money & film-making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train, making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point. the script by eric forsberg is rubbish, for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious & when you actually break it down & look at it this should have been much more light hearted. in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie (2000) type spoof. you know something, i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad. for a start the character's are rubbish & it's impossible to emote with anyone, the story is downright awful & makes no sense (if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from? why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end? why did bujo kill the train driver? how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles? where did that typhoon come from at the end?), it takes itself far too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake & it's just a very, very poor film on just about every level.director mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch. there's barely any blood or gore, there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin, someone gets shot & that's about it. the special effects are rubbish too, the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better. it's not scary, there's zero atmosphere & it's a bit of a bore from start to finish. the real live snakes are a problem too, they are just so docile & nonthreatening. if you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction.shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget & it show's, basically it looks cheap because it is. the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with.snakes on a train is rubbish, i am sorry but that's how i feel & i don't quite know how else to describe it. i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train, it really is that bad.

there are spoilers but trust me, i'm doing you a favor.my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often. inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes; we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact...not worth watching. however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. so, as another reviewer has said, films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. i prefer the idea of; instead of straight to video you have straight to internet. that way the ass-bags who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit. which unfortunately you know they do. they hire a bunch of actors who can't act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish, to arabs to being 100% fluent in english, random nudity, a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. the fact that i actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies me...anyways, the movie is great to make fun of, but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire, because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off, you will feel physically ill. i kid you not. my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh!t.this film is one above alien vs. hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made. and i've seen lots of bad movies. incidentally, it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well. just thought you might like to know that little fun fact. -100 out 0f 10.

oh. good. grief.i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought "i must watch this movie, ripping off snakes on a plane, it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too. sounds fantastically bad". well, i was half right.this movie is eye-meltingly bad and, sadly, not even unintentionally hilarious. it's just bad. even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action. for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (mexican or spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on. then we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway, as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous.low-budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. what we have here is a movie given no thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it's very few strengths. i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous. avoid if you can.see this if you like: stagknight, the wicker man remake, terrible cgi.

this usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) i'm hardly tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) i don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. so with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'inglorious basterds'now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. tarantino is happy enough to take the title from enzo castellari's (less than spectacular) dirty dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'inglorious' opens with a nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding jews in his basement. this is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. of course, one of the hidden jews makes her escape (but more of her later) we (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of lt. aldo raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like b-movie king aldo ray....ha-ha quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than brad (dallas) pitt (sorry, dallas was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, mr jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking nazi-killer. meanwhile mr tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'dirty dozen'?raines 'platoon' consists of (john cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on adolf hitler. tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) eli roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'bear jew') the other man is called hugo stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the qt fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) keep up the good work tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both raine and his men (the 'inglorious basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill hitler at the showing of a nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)more boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. and any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's david bowie song in a wwii movie.my problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. i don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) i knew of inglorious bastards, enzo castellari, aldo ray, hugo stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) ennio morricone's haunting score from revolver. i go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire barad pitt, i'll assume you (mr tarantino) are the main draw here? i don't want the audience directing the movie. i pay to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity....not how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. it's high time the fan-boys (on imdb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)the tired old argument with tarantino worshippers is "well, if you can do better...do so" let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull qt has.....i'd want to offer you a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better wwii movies than this tripe. the directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. it's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. i'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?

i will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best."this is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film tarantino has ever done." "the only good thing in this movie was the performance of mr. waltz"."so i was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened" now for more details go and read "hated it" reviews.one thing i hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people. (spoiler ahead). now i know tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, adolf hitler and 200 top nazis officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied france and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? where also an american-african walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. these 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to slay hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. at least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (go watch valkyrie). besides, mike myers impersonation of a british general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing hitler, just picture that.what ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.after watching the movie, i was sympathizing with nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our basterds!!! imagine that.my recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break, go watch this movie.

"tnt jackson" isn't completely unwatchable. but either the version i saw on dvd was edited with a weed-whacker, or the screenplay itself is the lowest level of grind-house/blaxploitation sausage. or maybe both.jeanne bell is supposed to have been a playmate at one point in her career,and the movie makes the most of the connection by displaying her breasts at least two times more than was really necessary (including a hilarious topless fight scene that i am pretty sure was meant to be funny). i will admit, they are quite nice. still, she's sort of average looking and doesn't have the charisma of a foxy brown, of even a cleopatra jones. she does have her moments as an actress in the film, though, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the screenplay had given her a chance to do more than emote "attitude" and kick people.speaking of kicking people, the fight scenes (the other putative reason to watch a film like this) are pretty poorly done.there's no real choreography to speak of here, just people posing and sticking feet and fists in the general direction of their opponents. one minor exception is a nice moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives; another is a sequence near the very end where an obvious stunt double for bell (and maybe for stan shaw) leap around and do some decent sweeps and groundwork for a minute or two before bell/"jackson" punches her enemy's liver out, shaw collapses and the screenplay just stops. (again, i will admit that this is very much in the tradition of shaw brother quickies since time immemorial).there are a couple of supporting actors who are actually better than the film deserves (i'm thinking of "joe" and the fellow playing the drug lord's right hand man). there's a halfway decent funk laden soundtrack that complements the action on the screen and add a star to the rating by itself. there's a semi-dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself.this one is strictly for hardcore fans of blaxploitation. i saw it out of sheer curiosity, and i'm not sorry i took the time. but i can't imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless i decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture intersections of "kung fu theater" and "foxy brown".

a good ol' boy film is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to "plot" and at least one very pretty country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. the pretty gal is here (dressed in designer jeans)-- but the redneck prerequisites stop there. jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff, he comes up way short. big john is big, but he isn't convincing with the "bad" part of his moniker. bug-eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades; ned beatty also does his part in a small role... but there is no story. it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film. cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme. you know the one; it was made famous by... jimmy dean.

no way out 2007 was a really bad and if it is the road to wrestlemania they choose the wrong road.chris benoit & the hardy boys def mvp & minn: in my view this was the best match of the night some good wrestling here but not much. 7/10cruisweight championship open(which chavo guerrero won): awful, no high flying at all, really quick and boring. 3/10little bastard & finlay def little bogeyman & the bogeyman: this was more comedy than wrestling, some laughs. 5/10kane def king booker: a decent effort by these two but they could do better. 6/10wwe tag team championship paul london & brian kendrick def deuce & domino:another boring match,no high flying by the champs. 4/10ecw world title mr kennedy def bobby lashley (disquilification): in my mind the worst match of the night. truly awful.i thought ecw was no rules,i was wrong 2/10john cena & shawn michaels def batista & the undertaker: an okay match but could have been a hell of a lot better. 6/10overall this was bulls*it id give it a 3/10

doesn't this seem somewhat familiar? oh wait, that's right.. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the tv series. what's the point in repeating yourself, you may ask? is it for the benefit of the americans who haven't seen the programme? did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration? or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia, and forgot they'd covered this ground already? either way, for someone who has sat through the first three series, this was just really boring. i had to turn it off during the 'tablets that turn your water green' part.. yes it is very funny, but give us something original for goodness sake! actually, if the best new stuff you can come up with is leonard rossiter's take on saturday night fever, you can forget it.the guy they got to replace the late richard beckinsale is a lookalike alright, but not half the actor. personally i would exorcised the role, as a mark of respect to him. or better yet, not bothered making the film at all, and just let the hilarity of the tv series speak for itself. but no, they couldn't do that.. not as long as there was money to be made. sad, really. 4/10

the film version of 'rising damp' came out two years after the television series ended. like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened. i came away bitterly disappointed. eric chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes. at the time of the film's release, the 'rising damp' series was still being repeated regularly on i.t.v. so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already. at least the 'on the buses' movies boasted original screenplays.secondly, richard beckinsale had died the year before, so they eliminated the character of 'alan' as a mark of respect, substituting art student 'john', played by christopher strauli of 'only when i laugh' fame. it simply wasn't the same.as another poster has pointed out, rigsby's boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series, being bigger and altogether cleaner.director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'casino royale', a film steeped in surreal humour. 'rising damp' also has its share of 'walter mitty' style fantasy sequences, such as the 'saturday night fever' parody. personally, i found them horribly out of place. a case of 'over-egging the pudding'.on the plus side, leonard rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy 'rigsby', as are frances de la tour as 'ruth' and don warrington as 'philip. its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents.when rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by i.t.v. as a tribute, with its final scene - showing rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interests of good taste.

this film derives from a long running itv sitcom by the same name.the sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens rigsby,phillip,alan,mrs jones & vienna.then in 1980 the film version hit the cinemas.now when it did,sadly richard beckinsale had passed away & was replaced by only when i laugh actor chris strauli.i myself felt this gave the film a different feel.i would have preferred if it wasn't shot as richard was a key character.thats like having the porridge film without godber or mackay!the film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit de-ja-vu! many parts were seen before in the tv series. now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan!saying that leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie,just like in the tv series.the film has recently had a new lease of life on dvd and is usually on terrestrial over a quiet weekend.it is a cracking good film,but for rigsby fans you may feel that youv'e seen it similarly before.saying that though its worth a buying/watching7.8/10

this is a comedy version of "strangers on a train". it works pretty well. i am a harsh grader, so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot. the performances are extremely good, all of them. of course, the two stars, devito and crystal, shine most. each performer acts well enough to play off of. the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick. devito characters work best when depraved. his character, portrayed as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are. his character would, in real life, have a great agent and multiple solicitations. the characters are one dimensional, which is okay in comedy. but crystals's character is not written very well. his desire to kill the "moma" all of a sudden makes no sense at all. it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. the pitiful attempts are not too often, and the movie flows fairly well.

danny de vito shows us here he is definitely, indeed infinitely, a better on screen performer than off. he plays the part of owen, a miserable would-be writer with a cranky old mother (delightfully played by anne ramsey) he would like to see dead. billy crystal is larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has an estranged wife he feels the same way about. so owen, after viewing hitchcock's "strangers on a train", suggests they swap murders.as director though, de vito's control is inconsistent as he wastes this clever idea, while his film lurches from the very humorous to the very bland. he and crystal are okay in the lead roles, but the show belongs to anne ramsey as the cantankerous mrs. lift.saturday, june 20, 1992 - video

i've always said that there's nothing to beat the original form: the comics. i've been proved right again. this, like all of the other movie takes on the asterix series, failed to impress. the makers of this movie don't get it that what makes all the other such comic-turned-movies (x-men, superman et al.) ventures successful is that they all deviate from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable. agreed, this movie did deviate, in the sense that this movie was a cross of two asterix books, viz. asterix and the great crossing & asterix and the normans. also, uncharacteristic of the asterix series (save asterix and the secret weapon) , a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced. all this ended up doing was create a childishly immature storyline. the funny parts were very few and far between. all in all, a total waste of time and money watching this, let alone at theaters, even at home.

it's not awful but what a waste... lousy gags, bad music, poor drawings and animation...regarding the impressive number of animators and intervallists on this picture (from, hum... a hundred different studios throughout the world? come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!) i wonder if one guy on the credits = one drawing! the lines are rough, the 3d work inadequate (i'm not against it, but not in this film) but the backgrounds are corrects. the storyline is rather dumb, far from the precise cleverness of the bd, and obviously aimed at an international audience. to distribute a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple-minded guy... a cultural object is far more interesting when challenging, even when it is a foreign movie (being french in this case it's even worse!).some new stuff is doing well (the olaf character, sometimes, like with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, sms -not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: does anyone know imagination?). but, hey, it's a m6 / tps production with some celine dion in it... pathetic.asterix is underemployed and obelix talks too much. goudurix could be great (like in the book) but he is too clearly a "cool guy" having a love affair (with an uninteresting made up female character). in fact, only the vikings (wizard excepted) are funny. too much action, not enough laughs. the best part of the movie are the end credits. not the music, but the few stills it contains. bd style. well, definitely, asterix is not made to move!

this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons. soulless, technically good and the usual in-jokes for adults. maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa: castle in the sky, but it was quite disappointing.the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and obelix going to the viking's territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well. oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship... yadda yadda.the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes. the vikings get all the best ones. such as vikea (the viking's chief's wife) giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). oh, and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious (as much for the voice acting as the dialogue).for example, aboard the viking ship: (after a speech by abba, the captain's daughter) olaf: who is this new guy? captain: that's my daughter, cod-brain! olaf: your... daughter's... a man?

this film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone. it's obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this: the animation is fluid, detailed and superb- the soundtrack isn't too memorable except for the ending song by celine dion (at least i think it was her). the musical score is powerful full orchestra material. kudos to the animators and music composers! 9/10. however, the story and characters fall flat. it feels very 'been there, done that', predictable and plain uninteresting. the characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable. they annoyed me to no end. i tried really hard to like this, but i didn't care about the story- it was cliché action-adventure plot. there were 'jokes' that weren't funny. it was vomit inducing predictable from start to end. the dialogue was cliché and awful- especially the last line "it's not ... that gives you wings, it's love!" whatever it was, i remember cringing. i was wishing it would hurry up and finish. i wasn't the only one either- the people i went with thought it was boring. please watch the asterix and obelix cleopatra film if you're going to watch any. this was a waste of time.

i think it's the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed. there were two reasons why i went to see "astérix et les vikings": first as a film buff, and second as a big astérix fan.in the end, the film doesn't satisfy any request. it's simply a big animated mess and it proves that the astérix franchise is going from bad to worse.in fact, it has been this way since the death of first scenarist rené goscinny in 1977. his faithful collaborator, illustrator albert uderzo took his place, but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the goscinny years."astérix et les vikings" is based on the book "astérix et les normands", which was published during the goscinny reign. the basic story is the same: goudurix, abraracourcix' nephew' arrives to the village and astérix et obélix must turn him into a real man, while the vikings come to gaul in order to discover what fear is, because it seems that fear gives wings.the similarities end here. what follows in the book is a non-stop series of laughs, gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the vikings do discover fear and they flee gaul. the movie is silly, unfunny, fast-paced, corny... well, just name a default and it has good chances of being applied...the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good. but the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit. even older astérix movies such as "astérix le gaulois", which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily better.animation has the quality of other 21st century movies, but it has its faults and any film beginner could find the mistakes. the greatest example is the continuity mistake, where the day follows the night after a fraction of second, in the same sequence.imagine. they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can't get adequate film-making.the changes of the original story are simply unbearable. and they still could be even if there was no original story. goudurix, in the movie, has a pet pigeon named sms and who act as his cell phone (!). grossebaf, the viking chief, has a rebellious teen daughter named abba (!) and she constantly defies her father's authority. there's also a stupid viking wizard, his cartoonish dumb and muscular son, the faithful bride of grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration (her name is vikea!) and... well i can't stand that much longer.we're far from the original gags from the original book. the biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen. i remember that the greatest moments in the book were obélix laughing at the invaders' names (which all finish in 'af') and goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways.and if everything wasn't enough, somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there's an already existing céline dion song which would be featured in the final credits. if it was a new song, i could have understood. but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they're ready to do anything in order to attract film-goers.the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't walk out of the theater without being left cold. in a summer release, it just can't hurt...the only other acceptable point of the movie is how goudurix becomes courageous. his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it's better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believable.so if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money on it. grab the book instead.oh rené, why did you leave us?

hargh... this film is so bad it's almost good. trash at its best. jesus' bro vs. pimps...come on. i'd say that you'd actually have to see this, it's so bad... my sides hurt when i laughed. i can't understand why this isn't in the worst 100.

this film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. when i was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, i had just started teaching in secondary (high) school. the whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom i decided to watch some rather awful films. the flintstones was one of the films that i chose, and then i put "king of the streets" (the uk title of 'alien warrior') on. just before it finished i found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all...my life, the film stock, the £2 i had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the blockbuster ex rental section, the time it must have taken to print the sleeve art, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligable as their efforts were)...the list goes on.i love bad films. let me make this perfectly clear - i love watching crappy films from blockbusters. me and my mate dan used to sit and watch many, many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them. but this was a different type of crappy film. i don't think that anything has come close to this, not even tobe hooper's "death trap" (which is probably my second worst film in the world). the whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me; the repetition of music at any available opportunity, regardless of on-screen events; the whole.... aaaggghhhhhhh!!!!! i can't even carry on with this 'critical' dissection, as my gag reflex has started. the futility of that film, even now, three years after i watched it for the first and last time, still renders me speechless (but i am still able to type). the whole "making a car from odd parts" section had me contemplating horrible things.i implore you, if you are interested in watching this film, just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back. i can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is. don't, under any circumstances, contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever. not if you are a christian and you want to see a christ allegory; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute). make no mistake about it, this film is unholy. it is the antichrist in video form. as bo cattlett in get shorty said: "i've seen better film on teeth".

imagine if you took the christ myth, mixed it with a healthy dose of porn, against a backdrop of bad sci-fi blackxploitation(brotha from another planet like) throw in a dash of after school special, and lots of really bad kung fu fighting. oh and some decent break dancing. with an awesome casio keyboard soundtrack.and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine. there are at least 4 rape scenes, at least one great car explosion, a buff black guy running around in his undies with an uzi.add alcohol and this is the perfect movie.i mean lots and lots and lots of alcohol

ugh. unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. none of the characters are remotely likable, which makes this film difficult to watch. they're all miserable thirty year olds who don't take responsibility for their crummy lives. i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film, so there's a chance things got better afterward, but i doubt it. i can't imagine five people as self-absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years.three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they had no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a gratuitous (failed) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull film.save your time and money, and skip this movie.

synopsis correction: the ending does not show ben cruising online for guys. he is looking up arabic language courses at the presido military acadamy in san francisco. perhaps to join the war in iraq as a translator, (fyi- many of the dishonorable discharges from "d'ont ask d'ont tell have been translators (they are now it major short supply) ben also spoke russian. this movie is a good time capsule of life in manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here. mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of "grown up" twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode. also a brief study of the always changing scene in manhatten.(somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b.s.)watch together the films "englishman in new york"" and the "the new twenty" both good for nostalgia. i think the movie "twenty" shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolved.these two films are gay time travel for sure!!!!enjoy

talk about marketing. the poster/home video cover of 'the new twenty' broadcasts a half-naked male in a "wolfe video." for those familiar with the gay-themed movies  this broadcasts a "must-see." (i loved reading one reviewer (from another site) stating they had been "tricked" into seeing a "sodomite" movie. are you serious? the tagline itself as the word "gay." the lord gives you eyes, yet you cannot see) that being said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: the lonely gay, the aids victim gay and the closeted gay) it's more about long-term friendship and characters that grow apart. in fact, if anything, there's more (here's one for christians to complain about) heterosexual couples having sex outside of, gasp!, marriage. not to mention backstabbing, drinking to excess and drug usage. i see this more of a made for tv-logo or showtime movie than big screen effort. sure, i loved the cinematography, some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a big-group-of-friends that actually act like they've known each other for a million years. but we've see this all before. nothing really "new" here. barely an original idea  hence bringing back the same 'ole "i have aids, let's deal with that" for a good portion of the movie and boy, our friend has a serious drug problem, but let's not deal with that until it's almost too late. that's so (us) 'queer as folk' and 'broken hearts club,' respectfully. the film deals with a group of college buddies, now grown (in size not minds) who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing. strangely, as in most of these independent movies, the most interesting, to me at least, was the heavier-set one, ben. he stole each scene, but, again, there wasn't much to take.

what we're given in this trying-to-be trendy film is a "frat-pack" of college friends, now approaching age 30 (which we all know, of course, their generation thinks of as the "new 20"). consisting of four guys and a gal, we have thrust at us the following types: seemingly "unemployeds" and frequent drug users, along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying-to-be. they are all, in their own way, drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness. with one, possibly two exceptions, these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after. there is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. except in the instance of one individual (who appears on the way to finding it), none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his/her life. and so, about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt "i love you."with only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories.ps--writer/director, johnson, definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones. why might that be?****

"the new twenty" is one of the worst films i have ever seen. yes, some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse, but i would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic "indie" film that pretends to be more is worse. "the new twenty" was written and directed by chris mason johnson, and i will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that i wasted on his film.the screenplay & charactersfrom beginning to end, the screenplay failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail. in story telling, the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man, man vs. the world, and man vs. himself. the screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in new york, and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself, where each of the film's characters are so self-absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes. each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict; a fiancée who has sex with her fiancée's boss/investor, even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character; a man who begins as a decent guy, but is attracted to a foul-mouthed investor, and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul-mouthed business jackass; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek, who does nothing, but find dates online; and a gay asian man who dates an hiv positive older man, but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops).crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self- loathing of the fiancée that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "gordon gecko" type character and become a jackass; a story line for the chubby cyber geek; and more scenes of interaction between the asian man and hiv positive boyfriend are all missing.without proper establishing details, all of the characters' actions seem forced and contrived.direction, cinematography & scorei found mr. johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. the cinematography can be described as mundane at best. mr. johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of new york city. this failure created a claustrophobic film, that viewed like the filming of a stage play, and not a film.the score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. i assume that mr. johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot.conclusion"the new twenty" is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film-making.

oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! this film was so close to a masterpiece, alas it was not to be, as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the moon. the mst3k version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called captain cody, where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the moon, but it didn't quite add up.also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as i expected them to be. all in all, a great disappointment.

there must be an error. this movie belongs with "plan 9", and a lot others as a quite entertaining, silly diversion. you'll never accept you like it, yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on tv. it's as simple as that.

mexican 'classic' was the third entry in the aztec mummy series. as you will soon find out, this movie is anything but a classic, instead, it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you.some scientist wants to steal aztec treasure from a tomb, but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial: the aztec mummy. knowing he can't beat the mummy, he then builds a robot, and a very bad one at that. we only get to see mr.robot in the last reel, as he clunks around, and does battle with the aztec mummy.i have seen a lot of lousy sci-fi films, hell most sci-fi films i see are lousy, but this one, for it's entire duration of 64 minuites, is the worst movie i've seen, with fubar coming in a close second....in conclusion: don't waste your time.

with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, i don't think that shakespeare is in any great danger. this is the story of an ancient aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised. his stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off. he seems to know who's doing this even though he's a gyrating, raving entity. i loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. there are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard, full of cheap crosses and other junk. there's a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. i can't begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robot, a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. the dialogue is awful. there are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines. i love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). nonetheless, if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously, watch this. have a couple beers first. like a direct line from the mummy's tomb, "watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." what more can i say?

**spoilers** the third and mercifully last of the aztec mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the mummy- actor ramon gay, as dr. eduardo almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on may 28, 1960! still that didn't stop gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.in "robot vs the aztec mummy" we have the once again mad scientist dr. krupp trying to get his hands on the mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern mexico city over 500 years ago. "robot vs the aztec mummy" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous aztec mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.after getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous aztec mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane dr. krupp also know as "the bat". dr. krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed orson wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. an idea he must have gotten from watching ed wood's 1955 "atomic superman" classic "bride of the monster".unable to handle the mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, dr. krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the mummy, for him. with he mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local mexico city cemetery dr. krupp has his robot-man brake into the mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. ***spoilers*** the big built-up to the aztec mummy robot-man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the "tin-man" in less then 30 seconds together with its creator dr. krupp. all this while both dr. almada and his friend and assistant pinacate, who came to the mummy's aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. now without the mad and off-the-wall dr. krupp annoying it the mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like dr. krupp, that it has really no interest in.

following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one, this incredibly dull, slow, and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown. once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the bat (hammy luis aceves castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the aztec mummy popoca. the bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal. flatly directed by rafael portillo, with a talky and tedious script by alfredo salazar and guillermo calderon, cruddy continuity (for example, the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but is miraculously alive and well here!), an excruciatingly sluggish script, an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks, a meandering narrative, a crippling lack of action and momentum, largely dreary going through the motions (non)acting from an understandably disinterested cast, and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot (the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash, but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom), this numbingly dry, drippy, and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout.

the first 2/3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the american mummy films of the 30s and 40s. two lovers in ancient mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. one became an aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. and the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. so far, it's all the typical mummy film...though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the american versions. oh, and of course the aztec mummy looked really, really crappy.however, into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. why? i dunno--it sure didn't make any sense to have one. it seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the aztec treasure is buried. why does he need the treasure? well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! but first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.you've got to see these "human-robots" as they look like the enormous clunky robots from flash gordon and other serials but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! they really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie. both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy... and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.overall, the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end. however, for bad movie fans, it's a must-see--it's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends.

i watched about an hour of this movie (against my will) and couldn't finish it. i'd rate it as a 0. the writing was bad, the plot predictable and one that's been done far too many times. the most annoying part of this movie was the acting done by melody thomas scott. this part did not call for someone appearing snobbish, but she managed in every single scene i saw to look like a (sour) snob or someone who was about to spout something extremely sarcastic or cruel. the two romances which seemed to develop into something serious almost upon the couples meeting was a bit too much. i should know better than to watch made for tv movies. if there is absolutely nothing on the telly and this is the only choice, read a book.

thursday june 9, 6:45pm broadway performance hall & saturday june 11, 1:45pm broadway performance hallbless the independent filmmaker. without them we'd see nothing but spielberg the farrelly brothers and films based on old sitcoms. they are the risk takers. they reap the rewards of success and suffer the failures. max and grace is most definitely a failure. credit is deserved by michael parness for getting out there and making his first feature which he claims drove him to bankruptcy. he might be better off sticking to the stage if this film is any indication of what to expect in the future. even though everyone warned me i went to see max and grace anyway, hoping i might discover something they did not. it starts off well enough, a party for max in his parent's house shot in warm subdued light, the camera floating into interesting angles. as soon as we see max has hung himself, an obvious rip-off of harold and maude, the whole thing goes right in the tank. how could he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? for that matter how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the blessings of all parties concerned? in the q&a after the film david krumholtz suggested the entire story was the surrealist dream of his character max. this story is so badly written the comment sounded more like an excuse. the film doesn't look as though it was made on a shoestring, all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results. what's intended as funny isn't but instead is offensively bad. the continuity is sloppy the lighting is dreadful and the effects look cheap and forced. bph seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full but i saw at least thirty or forty walkouts within the first half-hour. at one point grace, played by natasha lyonne, laments her inability to die. i found myself thinking the same thing since i never walk out before the credits. if krumholtz really thinks this is "one of the best scripts" he has ever read it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading. a terrible waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independent i've seen since bubba-ho-tep.

from 1936-1939, peter lorre made a string of highly successful mr. moto films. while technically b-films, they were much better made than typical films of the genre. however, lorre tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends he wanted out of the series. when it was canceled in 1939, lorre was thrilled but his plans of getting more complicated and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to columbia pictures. island of doomed men is one of these films and it's pretty obvious the studio isn't putting much effort into the movie, as i think the plot was written by penguins. talented penguins, perhaps...but still the movie made little sense at all.it begins with a guy agreeing to be an undercover agent for the government. he is to infiltrate an island in the us where something strange is amiss. now they easily could have just got a search warrant to do this. but, given that penguins were writing the film, the agent takes the rap for a murder he didn't commit and spends a year in prison for this. he apparently hopes that he'll be paroled to this island, as many parolees are sent there when they finish the term.there are some more serious problems with this idea. first, they only have him serve a year before getting paroled--but he was convicted of murder and he refused to divulge who he really was. they would never parole anyone in a case like this. second, what if he wasn't paroled to the island? he would have spent an entire year in jail for nothing! third, why not just have scuba divers or paratroopers or cops in boats come to the island?! talk about a contrived plot! once on the island, the agent discovers that evil peter lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with guys on parole as slave labor. what about the men having to report to their parole officers? this was never explained, but lorre was using them to mine for diamonds and they were treated abominably. now, another question i had was that if lorre was discovering huge diamonds there, he was a very wealthy man. so, why not just pay people to mine for the diamonds?! why set up your own version of devil's island and savagely beat and kill the men?! eventually, lorre gets what's his and the island's slaves are released. unfortunately, by then, i really didn't care. overall, watchable but rather dumb. lorre's career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to warner brothers. with films like island of doomed men, i could see why his stay at columbia was short.

greetings all,isn't it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing ?i was so delighted by the first viewing of this film, i couldn't stop talking about "flatliners" to all my friends for weeks - mind you i was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then.then somehow i forgot about this film until i saw the dvd in my local department store and remembering how great it was i thought "right ! i'll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the special edition".last week, i was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch flatliners on dvd. the expectation was that i would love this film even more on 2nd viewing.. how wrong i was !verdict: after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficially.i have never been a big fan of julia roberts' acting (excepting for erin brockeridge in which she deserved her oscar) i think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script. i left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential, and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren't very well done at all. not even the score by james-newtown howard, who i rather like as a film composer, could captivate and thrill me.in 1990 i would have given this film 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 i'd be lucky to give it 2 / 10 at best.

the only thing more full of holes than this movie's premise is its script. flatliners is the ideal showcase for joel schumacher's glorious, flamboyant, brazen lack of talent. the plot is totally illogical but super fake-ponderous and everything is art-directed within an inch of its life in the most clichéd, overheated way. i love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum low-lit in red with huge rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. i love how keifer sutherland drives a canvas-backed army jeep. no one in joel schumacher's movies lives in an un-eccentric manner. it's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip, but hip strictly and obsessively according to an out-of-touch middle-aged billionaire man-child's idea of hip. and holy crap! the part where baldwin brother #16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he's slept with who intone "i'll call you" and "i just need some space" is the funniest friggin' thing in the whole universe!!!! what kind of a world do we live in where joel schumacher gets to keep having people throw money at him? "flatliners" made me want to review the man's entire oeuvre solely for the kind of high-quality yuks contained therein.

what i came away with after watching this movie was a guilty conscience. the film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and premise to it, but unfortunately it is a movie that you cannot watch with out being bombarded with pornography. if you plan on viewing this and have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act for the viewing pleasure of an audience then you are making a big mistake. this is not the type of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip on your dvd player. near the beginning of the film baldwin's character is video taping his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. this tape and others like it continue to pop up throughout the movie at unpredictable times. it appears that the film is attempting to make a statement about the dignity of women. ironically in doing so they made multiple women into prostitutes. i only gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because had they handled baldwin's promiscuity better it would have been an interesting film.

i don't much mind the factors that others here have objected to - acting, lighting and so forth. for the most part, these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across. it's just a horror film, after all.what bugged me were the points themselves. because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is deeply tacky. in fact it's actually fundamentalist christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist christian film. look at the 'sins': * sutherland's character picked on a kid at school when he was a pre-teen, leading to his accidental death.* baldwin's character used masculine wiles, persuasion and good looks to shag quite a few women, some of whom he videotaped. ooh, the swine! how unlucky for him that women are such passive, gormless creatures that they had no complicity in the matter.* roberts' character's dad came back from vietnam a junkie, so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself. yes, what a terrible sin! why couldn't he have just become an alcoholic like all the others?* and bacon's character picked on another schoolkid. how awful! the fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for nought. children, it seems, are divinely judged by adult criteria.well, maybe lots of people support this level of moral absolutism. it certainly seems to have gone unremarked in this movie's comments. does everyone just buy this stuff? at least human laws treat children differently from adults, recognising that their ethical sense is partially-formed. this film has no such qualms, and i find that pretty objectionable. ditto the notion that women are helpless, fluffy creatures before young men's evil lusts. or that a vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. pathetic.

2/3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies, a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. and somehow it feels like a rip-off even though i haven't seen the stuff before. it's like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. i've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage, but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences, so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the motion picture public.i got to see it in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days. i give the movie some credit for semi-convincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor, but that's about it. the aztec mummy monster looks good, even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. but the robot is pitiful, although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. it's a "robot human" or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. i think that's considered an android. so technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie should be called "android vs. the aztec mummy", but i doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality. in fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good. even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak -- for example at one point the hero says "i might as well begin at the beginning...." what the heck kind of translation is that? couldn't they at least have him say "start at the beginning" so that it doesn't sound repetitive? a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie. it's the epitome of utilitarian film-making, just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. they put no more effort into making it than they had to, and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie.i will now cease posting about it on the principle that i don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it.

ah, such an original title for a very shoddy film. the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match. as a result, i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold. there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. the aztec ceremony had me laughing. i rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. the singing aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot. some guy gets a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that i really cared), and it's a whole noir mess. oh, and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. you won't miss anything exciting.

i saw this on mystery science theater 3000, and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable. i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. of course, you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old, but i've seen silents that were better. the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes. the cameraman apparently doesn't know what a tripod is, and had too much coffee, or something harder maybe, because the camera is always shaking around. i couldn't even follow the plot, but suffice it to say, this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life.update: i saw "epic movie" a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2. it's not the worst movie i've ever seen anymore!

i am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all that bottom 100 movies, and i do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. some of them, e.g. the infamous manos the hands of fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on your own without any friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema taste. la momia azteca contra el roboto humano, however, was not that bad. well, of course it's bad - it's silly, dated, corny, cheap, etc., there's an aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, mexican mobsters, etc. the montage is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, the fx and sfx are the best what the mexican low budget production could've offered, etc. etc. still, the movie is fun. it's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. sure it depends on one's sense of humor, however i'm pretty sure la momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. please note: the movie lasts for about an hour, and i think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. there's also another thing - watching la momia can give you a clue what was the whole sf/horror genre concept back in the fifties, when you compare it to the present day matrix era of cinema entertainment. i think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact the watches like la momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright), and very often receive a standing ovation.

six stars for paul newman's portrayal of general groves, negative four for the inclusion of a highly fictionalized event where the truth is well documented. michael merriman did not really exist. his character--or at least his fate--is based loosely on that of louis slotin, a canadian physicist who did not come to los alamos until after the war. he conducted his lethal "tail of the dragon" experiment in may 1946. this is a critical point. the effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the hiroshima and nagasaki blasts. had anyone died of radiation poisoning at los alamos before the trinity test, it's very possible that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work, and history would have been changed. whether for the better or the worse we can only speculate. someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added merriman's character for dramatic effect or to deliver an anti-nuclear message. for a more even-handed and accurate treatment of events at los alamos during the manhattan project, see the tv movie, "day one," or better yet, read the peter wyden book on which it is based.

well, since it's called porno holocaust and directed by joe d'amato, i went into this film expecting sleaze...and while i somewhat got it, porno holocaust was a massive disappointment as it's just so damned boring. the title suggests that the film will feature porn, and that's not wrong - porno holocaust is pretty much just porn, and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again, i was fast forwarding before the end. the first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up, but after that it just degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the film (for the first hour!) is made up of talking, and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through! the plot focuses on a deserted island where, believe it or not, something strange is going on. naturally, it's not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists, who all happen to be sexy women, land on the island. they have sex a few times and some strange things happen, then over an hour later they're attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies...this must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno - a zombie who likes to get it on, but unsurprisingly it doesn't work well at all. the film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark, and that is far too long for a film like this. i have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is; if they'd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene, the film would have been under ninety minutes, and that would have made it much more tolerable! the zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear (it's quite a long time before there's a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place), and when it does finally appear, it's a huge disappointment! i realise that this is low budget b-movie trash, but d'amato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this! i'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting, atmosphere etc, there's no point. porno holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror, and i can't recommend it!

d'amato's hardcore/horror hybrid doesn't really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise, wherein various vapid contemporary types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments, but for the most part the film is so slow, the action so dreary and the cast so clearly repulsed to be having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a chore to watch.this is a pity, because the film sets up a promising idea. a group of scientists are taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small vessel. the scientists  three women and two men  are an intriguing cross section of sexual types, suffering to various degrees from nymphomania, co-dependency and frigidity; there's even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops off at a brothel to get serviced by two hunky caribbean studs for hire. the creature himself  a mangled native islander with a horribly scarred face and an unfeasibly long pizzle  bears some affinities with the old creature from the black lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has hovered over postmodern man since the cold war commenced, despite those of us in the west having retreated into hedonism and relativistic science.porno holocaust certainly is a film which shows the post-sexual revolution westerners coming across their mirror image in a nuclear monster, yet the torpidity with which it unfolds really lets down the fierceness of the idea. there is a promising interplay of action shots with pov shots, which suggest that the monster (who looks/stalks on as horror monsters from their pov position tend to do) is akin to the voyeur in the audience getting off on the sex between the "beautiful people." the sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his over-sized member certainly throws the target audience's ugly fantasies in their face. but d'amato has developed similar ideas better in other films, and porno holocaust is a potentially fierce idea let down by the execution (even d'amato's usual cinematographic skills let him down with much dreary camera-work).

despite having a very pretty leading lady (rosita arenas, one of my boy-crushes), the acting and the direction are examples of what not to do while making a movie.placed in southern mexico, popoca, the aztec mummy (real aztecs, by the way, did not made mummies) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in mexico city suburbia, during the first movie (the aztec mummy). in this second part, the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice...)into this appears the bat, a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (some idiot inside a robot suit) to control popoca and (get this) take over the world. the final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever witnessed. the funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious mexican movie studio!the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english (they dubbed the over-acting!). you should watch this movie through mst:3000. the comments are even funnier.

it's strange, while the film features full x-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it ought to.a group of scientists go to an island in the caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident. upon their arrival, a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women. doesn't it always seem to work out that way.among the sored acts we find a some lesbian encounters, a three-way with male prostitutes, assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of an already dead body. even though it's all fully explicit, it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to. as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it's edge; the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex.there is some blood and gore with the murders, but given that this is a d'amato flick it's really tame. for a much more rounded experience watch the similar 'erotic nights of the living dead'.2/10

as a serious horror fan, i get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. so i wouldn't call it naiveté that i assumed this was softcore horror ripping off cannibal / zombi / jungle holocaust. unfortunately, i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore. i should have realized that when i saw the odd "no actual or identifiable minor was used" warning. notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him? a group of scientists, half of whom are pretty women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a penchant for 69ing on the beach, in search for a mutated native killing villagers. due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island, the radiation turned this last man into a rapist/ killer.writer/ actor george eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on. the sex scenes are whacked out. women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down. well, two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are horndogs. i saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herself.if there is anything you should know about this film, it is that. because the rest of this insane movie is just the same. oh, who am i kidding? there is a ton more to tell here. like the white "duchess" that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor. or the "duchess" taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself. when he refuses her advances, she starts crying. so being the good gentleman he is, he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members. i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the "duchess" to ask if there is any other way to pay him.and all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research. wait, i thought this was a zombie flick? but the zombie doesn't enter until the 73min mark, but by that time everyone else has been "entered" plenty. i found myself hitting fast forward a few scenesor several. this is my first splatter porn flick and i don't think it does that subgenre any justice. i guess it is the woman in me talking when i say that i would like more plot and less sweaty, slobbering, hairy sex. funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family, was a good one. even eastman's character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating. it makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgusted.i don't feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad. this production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including erotic nights of the living dead, which sports most of the same cast. eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck. nevermind, i feel like talking about the sound suddenly. the sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking italian, it seems as though they recorded english voiceovers and played that over their dialogue. so while 2 people are boning, i can clearly hear someone in the background say, "no! yes! wonderful! wait!" there was a slightly amusing italian score that couldn't save this movie. the sfx were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes. and i would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the dvd cover (ahem, another marketing ploy), so no fear there. only fear the bad movie.presented in widescreen 1.85:1 aspect ratio. i watched the region 1 not rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by exploitation digital. there is apparently a xxx version by alfa digital, which is the same running time, so i doubt anything is different. prices vary, but you shouldn't pay more than $25.00 for a copy. or as i would recommend, pay nothing and pretend it doesn't exist.favorite quote: shipmate, "civilians are bad luck. women are bad luck. they're scientists too? they must really be monsters." dvd extras: original trailer with hardcore shots & kills to make it look more interesting than it is, trailers for ss hell camp, emmanuelle, & enotld, and a very informative interview with eastman.bottom line: lame porno, but even weaker as a horror film. either get real porn or watch real horror.rating: 3/10 by molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com

joe d'amato might have made some other notable movies in his very long and very prolific career- prolific, of course, by turns of making very cheap z-grade movies in italy's big exploitation boom of the late 70s early 70s- but porno holocaust isn't one of them, or at least shouldn't be. granted, i should not expect much from a movie with such a title, but i thought considering the back of the box's description that it might have some fun horror scenes with the "horny, mutant, cannibal zombie". turns out the zombie doesn't appear until more than halfway into the movie, and at every turn we get instead a tawdry sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine. which is fine. but it's not very enjoyable, except in the most "what the f*** is this bs" kind of way. there's laughable dialog involving lobsters costing more from mail-order japan than in paris, hot, slim women play biologists and zoologists who have particular sexual hang-ups (letting the door be unlocked to be raped, and a bi-polar kind of enjoyment out of getting gang-banged).it all leads up to the island, where the "main attraction" is a guy who early on just spends an absolutely pathetic (forget ludicrous) amount of time just staring at the newcomers to the radioactive wasteland of the shot-on-caribbean island, and once revealed has a face like one of the guards in jabba's palace and has a sweet potato for a main genital. but much dumber than anything before it is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has an inordinate amount of time to escape, but just sits there, blank-faced, as the monster brings gifts and for what must be a racially-motivated exploitation move on the part of the filmmakers the monster only rapes and kills the white women, and not her. and it ends, of course, with a "happy" ending. i use quotes, of course, out of a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending at all.bottom line, this is not what you might expect, as possibly being a bloody horror movie with plenty of tacky but cool looking italian monster-zombies devouring human flesh. if anything what violence is in the film is done on a shoe-string; a log hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath, which is like the aftermath of a tomato hitting someone. so really, the last part of the title is meant more for market sake. yet even as a porno movie it has little to go on except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the caribbean (as an interview with george eastman suggests, this was just one of a few quickies made while on the island). its got penny-bought schlocky camera-work and similar actors, filled with genitalia about 3/4 of the whole time and with wretched lip-syncing and music like nino rota forced at gun-point to make something snappy in a bordello, and it's still a piece of celluloid dung all the same; all of this could be an immense guilty pleasure, but it isn't.

wow. i felt like i needed to shower off after watching this one, but maybe there were other reasons that i will leave to your imagination. i felt used and abused after wacking, i mean watching this film. hairy chests, thick mustaches, and well, hairy everything describes this porn/horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without the hair.as a horror flick, this bites. but as a piece of exploitation/porn from italy's rich cinematic history- it definitely has a place in my library. the copy i have is in italian with english subtitles. i wish it had the really poorly dubbed english, i think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. the only white guy who gets laid in the movie is "mark shannon"- he is the moustache wearing, hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he "steps up to bat". this was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic. nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having "doggie-style" sex with a woman. i can't help but laugh.this is one of those movies that i pray my future wife and kids never find.

one of a few movies filmed at coronado high school in scottsdale, az in the late 80's as well as just one of the guys, bill and ted's excellent adventure and just perfect (which was a segmented movie played during the mickey mouse club.) movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on. coronado has gone through an overhaul in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone. the field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field, one of the few areas still there. the internal scenes near the lockers i believe were in the old 200 building.unless it is playing late at night on the disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick. how they ever made sequels to this is beyond me.

first off, i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video... i consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song "thriller" in its soundtrack. to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself, and the song must play the entire length of the video. calling this a music video is like calling the great gatsby a poem. on top of this... let's face it... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely dated werewolf transformation, the mindless vincent price poem (just because vp recites it doesn't mean it's not lame), and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen. sure, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but don't forget, this also happened at the same time the a-team was the #1 show on tv, so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one... one last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos... what exactly did this add to the equation that "billie jean" and "beat it" didn't already add? from what i can tell, it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog, or a superfluous dance scene... so you could say that all this video really did was give puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos... not quite my definition of great

i've seen several of these body snatcher type movies, but none was nearly as bad as this one.no thrill, no fx, bad acting, bad photography, bad sound, bad everything.blue jello eats'em all!

the opening was a steal from "eight-legged freaks", a film that is everything this one isn't. stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply - along with others that can't be repeated..! drifter type returns to his home(?)town, meets up with old friends etc.... the usual annoying kid, single mother,local loudmouth and so on..bad special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, (hey, didn't the director see "close encounters"?). good acting? good story? good camera angles? good cutting? not here! do not rent, unless you are sharing the cost and have a lot of beer handy. do not watch on tv, go and drink a lot of beer instead - you'll enjoy it more!

this film is so unbelievably awful! everything about it was rubbish. you cant say anything good about this film, the acting, script, directing, effects are all just as bad as each other. even ed wood could have done a better job than this. i seriously recommended staying away from this movie unless you want to waste about 100mins of your life or however long the film was. i forget. this is the first time i wrote a comment about a film on imdb, but this film was just on tv and i had to let the world of movie lovers know that this film sucked balls!!!!!!!!!!!! so if you have any decency left in you. go and rent a much better bad movie like critters 3

i cannot believe i sat through this utter waste of time. i was just too fascinated by how unspeakably bad it was that i couldn't move. it reminded me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes away from a horrible car crash or the rotting carcass of a cow. you can't help but look, but you feel sick and nauseated afterward.let me elaborate: "plan 9 from outer space", for instance, is not a bad movie. not even "star wars: holiday special" is a bad movie. they both are awful to watch, for sure, but they both have some qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach for the "off"-button.this "remake" (in name only) of the sci-fi classic left me weeping on my couch, desperately trying to come to terms with why such scripts get filmed, why anyone would soil the memory of the original classic, and whether or not i could resume my normal life without my suddenly acquired longing for the quiet and peace of death.although death, i realized, would offer no rest from the horrid memories of this pile of crap, as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over again for eternity...

this movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets). be warned! the first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character. the actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. i must say, the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious.as for the robot, i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. the bat's "robot" consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body. as tom servo put it, "he's not that impressive; he doesn't even have knees!" that, and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room. but once he catches you, watch out! he'll disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? pluh-ease!).this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots. otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.

they've shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it. the bad acting isn't enough... the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists. i love the original from 1953 so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead. because this one is such a bore.

alien body-snatchers in the desert. little blue rocks that look like they are made from cheap plastic. the overall storyline isn't bad if you like that kind of thing but the acting is so far beyond poor that it amazes me that some of them actually entertained my in the x files! and the special effects? hello?! where did they get their fx crew from, secondary school? i mean, come on; there was so much more they could have done! it was amateur and extremely basic. i didn't particularly enjoy it (and my dad fell asleep during it!) and of course our hero falls in love with the leading lady! its so typical and highly predictable. bleugh!!!!!

this is a pretty pointless remake. starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece chiller that was. the new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy.brian kerwin plays a 'city boy' photographer who returns to a semi-abandoned desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clichéd stock characters: the lollipop sucking daby-doll lolita, the 'ornery old coot prospector, the crippled vet and his asian wife, etc...kerwin's character witnesses the crashing of 'something' into a hillside and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around. the temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area vanishes, people start to act weirdly, things explode. kerwin's character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie. the film develops no sense of place, no character development, no humour, no tension. everything that made the jack arnold's original a creepy little cold-war paranoia classic has been abandoned. it just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends.the special effects aren't very special - the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling film wrapped round some ropes which were then dangled in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire-work ever put onto the screen. the script is repetitive - everyone says everything at least twice, kerwin gets to say "let's get out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in one scene. loads of things are left unexplained at the end - why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example? - not that anyone watching would care; if the film makers didn't care why should we?the acting is adequate - better than the script, which at times, has an under-rehearsed improvisational quality, deserves. though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible - a notable example of this is when elizabeth peña registers the briefest, token moment of "frustrated despair hands to face gesture" before following sulking son stevie outside to watch him do "angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table" gesture. continuity errors include the (gb) sticker on the back of kerwin's jeep appearing and disappearing, a double action of the gas in the exploding car, a towns-person being in two places simultaneously - once in the alien stevie's pov shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot, elizabeth peña appearing to shut a car door twice... you can tell i was gripped can't you? the movie commits that greatest of errors. it's boring.

based on a ray bradbury story; a professional photographer(brian kerwin)returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town, where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away. a lonely boy(jonathan carrasco) latches onto him for the attention; and the two witness the landing of an alien craft in the rocky region of the desert. the aliens turn themselves into the images of townspeople. kerwin must convince evacuation of the town and falls in love with the young boy's mother(elizabeth pena). acting is pretty shallow; the story line is no worse than some others; this movie leaves you feeling that you got shorted on a decent ending. supporting cast includes: howard morris, dean norris and mickey jones.

having seen carlo lizzani's documentary on luchino visconti, i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low. but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied... i faced a need for critical opinion, which i generally don't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer. there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally. but when i read the reviews already written on this title, i also felt a bit confused. people sometimes don't know what to criticize. therefore, to be clear, i'll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably: the former one about visconti before his director's career and latter one about visconti the director. the aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents' divorce. we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano: in riches galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in true aristocracy. for instance, his father's splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. there is also an emphasis on visconti's crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people ("left wingers") who later had impact on his style and message in art. that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing (a contrast at first sight). however, the part about his director's career, which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. his movies are not discussed well. why? because there are very few people who really have something to say. franco zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right. there are also some interviews with franco rosi. but later, such movies like il gattopardo, la caduta dei rei, la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger. although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig, i did not like the interviews of his. moreover, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary... there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece, there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster. a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made. there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit. franco zeffirelli, though i appreciate him as a director, makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious. for instance, he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service. therefore, i say: simplified and unsatisfactory. what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself. as a result, we may get his own opinion about his works. for instance, i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig.i believe it is better to see luchino visconti (1999) by carlo lizzani than this doc. although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will get a better idea of the director. visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people's emotions and viewpoints into stone... 4/10

how dare you? adam low, without apparent shame, puts his name to this fake tribute. it's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great visconti's work. yes it's long and portentous, yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that, most people interested on the subject, have already seen. but what resounds the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip. the last and loudest voice comes from a third rate german actor, ranting and raving. the appropriately named mr.low directed this, hoping, i imagine, to get better ratings than his previous, more to the point, but deadly boring documentary on kurosawa. well i have news for you mr low and your cohorts. you missed a great opportunity and i for one, won't give you another.

luchino visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but adam low (the director of this thing) allows the stronger voice to be helmut berger's! how can it be? what a missed opportunity! we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all. the beautiful images belong to visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews to the likes of berger and zeffirelli to adam low's tiny little world. a must to avoid!

luchino visconti, the artist with the sword. courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus. film. theater. music. revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. a legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. he introduced the neorealism through the work of an american novelist james cain in "ossesione" he gave anna magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career. he gave us alain delon and maria callas. but the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain adam low and the voice of helmut berger. what a terrible fate.for those interested, there is a 61 minute documentary by director carlo lizzani (a man who really knew visconti) titled luchino visconti a portrait. it is out on dvd distributed by image entertainment

i, like most other people, saw this movie after hearing of it from patton oswalt. oddly enough, it was easier to find than i thought it would be. though, it shouldn't come as a surprise that i found it used.the plot is summed upped masterfully within the title. it's a bed that eats. nothing more, nothing less. there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good one.a demon's blood ended up on a bed and, as a result, it becomes possessed. it devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange fanta. there is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits. the narrative is told entirely through him.this movie fails horribly at everything, even at being bad. still, it's not without its own brand of charm.

ok, this is one strange film! fans of ed wood jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques director george barry utilizes, like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device! there is more humor than horror here, but i found it an uneven blend. you will be laughing and crying, and probably wondering why you got your hands on this. barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972, and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $10,000. that's 59 months and $9,900 too much! if you like your cheese on the campy side, with vintage '70s "gore", you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack.

"rvam"'s reputation preceded it. i first heard of it in one of those medved style movie books, "the 50 worst movies ever" or "the golden turkey awards", or something like that. every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. so when the exposed film society finally got around to showing it, i was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. however, "robot" wasn't really all that bad. oh, this is definitely a "z" film through and through. some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for k. gordon murray imports) is awfully cheesy, and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a frankenstein, since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous "aztec mummy" movie, narrated with a voice-over by the leading man. a dead giveaway: anytime the question "then what happened?" is asked more than twice in the dialog, you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. in rvam, "then what happened?" or "what happened then?" is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. even without the structural problems, the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older american audience. for instance, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story. he includes a remark about doctor krupp, "a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal" and began his quest for the treasure that the aztec mummy guards. no background, no explanation, he just "suddenly turned evil". obviously, this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience. the clincher, though, is the "robot", the supposed "showcase" of this movie. this robot is the worst robot special effect since "undersea kingdom" or even "santa claus vs. the martians". compared to this hunk of junk, the tin man from the "wizard of oz" looked like the terminator chassis that chased linda connor through the foundry in t2. the aztec mummy himself is well designed and executed; he's recognizably undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, and yet distinct from the "boris karloff" bandage collection familiar to most american audiences. but whoever designed the robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. they could at least have given him some knees, for heaven's sake. in addition, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (i've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) then the movie basically just stops. that seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.in spite of all these problems, the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a coleman francis film or a larry buchanan film was. compared to "monster a-go-go" or "attack of the eye creatures", "rvtam" is like a coppola film. it's just kind of dull and boring and silly. the actors are competent (in a mannered b movie way) and reasonably photogenic; dr. krupp, in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and "phantom of the opera" suit. i often found myself rooting for him, in spite of his being the villain. anyway, i've seen much, much worse. file this with "samson vs the vampire women", under "interesting mexican juvenile oddities".

i first heard of this film when patton oswalt talked about it on his "werewolves and lollipops" cd. he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. being a lover of terrible cinema, i knew i was in for a treat.this film is, hands down, one of the weirdest i've ever seen. certainly one of the weirdest shlock films. basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and it now eats. along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. the people can range between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. there's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. death bed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow, dull murder scenes take place. also, i must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. i would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment, it would sting a little. i guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so.the story is wacky, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors i've ever seen. probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved. certainly one you shouldn't miss.

it's difficult to criticize a movie with the title like 'deathbed: the bed that eats' and involves a ghost narrator who's trapped behind a 2-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and  if i'm not mistaken, masturbates. (now, that's getting back at its human companions!) furthermore, it foams up (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb edibles lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. again it's suffice to say, that don't expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange suds takes  dissolving only certain things. it'll drink the wine, but the bottle's okay and it'll eat away at the chicken bone, but the bucket's just fine. heck, the bed even replaces the unused containers. hilariously, at one point it downs pepto-bismol. i had to laugh at that one. i don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously. it's low budget, and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money. i thought, in a world where there can be a killer 'lift' and a 'blood beach,' this 'deathbed' might be amusing to watch. for reasons that might involve cost, 90% of the film is voice-over, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright/confusion on why a bed would attack (i can think of one  and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed) and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (a victim loses all flesh on his hands, barely saying "ow.") only one scene, that went on too long, was minutely tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back, using a sheet. where are the mst3k guys?

this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasn't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people. then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie. i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes. the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right. without muscles, you really can't move your hands but he did. the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands. the movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene. i was laughing so hard that i don't really remember how it ended. it had something to do with foam or something.

when i attended college in the early 70s, it was a simpler time. except for a brief occurrence in 1994, i've been totally free of the influence of illegal substances ever since and i've never regretted it...until now. db:tbte has got to be, hands-down, the best movie to watch when stoned. the odd, dreamlike state it creates is very strange when you're not smoking anything, but i'm sure that it would seem completely normal after a big doobie. (not that i'm recommending this, you understand.) the soothing narration, provided, as it usually is in quality cinema, by a tb victim trapped in a painting, would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow along as things get complicated. plus, everything in the film is pretty organic...from old-fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken.now, there's also no question that the young man with the (ahem) "hand problem" is absolutely sailing away in the film. at one point, you just know that he's going to say, "hey! when i move my hand, it leaves trails!!" trust me...you'll know when you get to that point.the only other thing we have to address is this: how good can a film be when at least half the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interior and exterior shots? definitely a must-see for horror aficionados, but suitable for the general audiences under the right conditions (if you know what i mean, and i think that you do). it only earns four stars because i can't actually say that it took any talent to make.

i had read online reviews praising this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror, quirky black comedy and borderline art-house; the film has elements of all three, to be sure, but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise (the title immediately gives the game away)  and amateurish production to boot  that its long-term neglect due to a lack of proper distribution  basically until cult epics picked it up for dvd release a full 30 years after its inception!  was no great loss to cinema or even the genre(s). the bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demon's dalliance with a woman; anyway, a dying man who had made use of the four-poster and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas(!) and provides intermittent commentary to the 'action'. several people (from teenagers-on-a-fling to gangsters-in-hiding) supply fodder to the perennially-hungry bed; latest on the menu are a trio of girls  one of whom, however, recalls its mistress of long ago and, consequently, the bed seemingly fears her! seeing various objects  from cigars to pieces of fried chicken  and people getting swallowed up (the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honey-colored liquid) makes the film mildly amusing at times (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeletal formation, which he seems to take rather too easily in his stride!), but also awfully repetitiousso that, at even a brief 77 minutes, the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate.

i used to work at the company that originally put out this film, vestron pictures. vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had, they didn't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films. not that money alone will buy you a good film. look at kevin costner's waterworld, for instance.sometimes, if you have a talented person in-house doing the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. but at vestron, there wasn't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area. in this case, it was on the director and the writer. which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the great ensemble cast this film has.i think the basic premise of this movie was "let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens." it's an intriguing idea, but not worth your time watching.most vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them. my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in non-vestron films. many times, we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad. we'd sit there, watching the trailer or ad, and afterwards, we'd turn to each, and almost in sync, we'd say, "now that's a vestron movie!" this is a vestron movie.

a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing. this movie is disturbing and pointless. there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line. what in god's name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie? the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty damn good. "the in-laws" is a funny movie. "the birdcage" is a hilarious movie. "the big lebowski" is a humorous movie. this movie is just dumb. i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the "novel" that this movie is based on. i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie. it just doesn't make any sense. people please - i beg of you - do not see this movie. you will regret it for the rest of your life. this movie is not the worst ever made, but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list.

i have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what i go through so you don't have to).the first viewing left me half crazed and babbling.the second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little better.i only screamed in agony once. seems pocona (the aztec mummy)had the hots for a certain aztec princess who was"supposed to keep her maiden".obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it.(now that is severe!).but before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching aztec ceremony.the singing will make your ears bleed. anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate & bracelet guarded by that swathed slob,pocona.by this time pocona looks like he's been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb.his groans & moans sounds like he has a bad case of montezuma's revenge(or he read the script for this movie).that will make your breath stink. an evil dr von krupp appears wanting the aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons & screenwriting classes for cast & crew).he is called the bat because in the curse of the aztec mummy he wore a bat like cape, hat and something like a ski mask over his face.guess it's better than the laughing fat man. the bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world. he stresses this by rolling his eyes,laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery.he has cobbled together an invincible robot.looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 buick.this will make your eyes bleed.a company even takes credit for making this tin can! well the mighty showdown between pocona and the robot takes place in the mummy's new crypt having been made homeless earlier. about half of this movie is culled from "la aztec momia"never released in the us in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from jerry warren(see my review on "attack of the mayan mummy") and "curse of the aztec mummy".the robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters.if that and the plot doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will. my first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one. but after seeing "mayan mummy"(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching "robot" again, it garners a 3.you have to watch this with no expectations at all. then it can be naively pleasant.

the usual disclaimer - i do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless, bad, low budget and silly, although they may deserve it. these films are often funny, and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry. this film fits this model perfectly. it is a mexican monster movie, riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects. the makeup is not that bad, and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining, but this film is almost as silly as aliens vs predator and the script isn't half as slick (aliens vs predator might get a 1 from me, but i want to see it again before i commit).the plot is ridiculous, but deliciously convoluted. if you've read this far, you must really want to know... a group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters. most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) mad, and quite perverse. this mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (who looks a bit like the tin man from wizard of oz, but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head). an aztec mummy, discovered by the same 'scientist' whose wife just so happens to have been an aztec princess in a past life (don't ask), is pitted against the robot for the big "climax" the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs.for what its worth, given the budget and the utter silliness of the script, this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie. if you're into that sort of thing, go for it.

i`m in two minds about following , the film debut of christopher nolan . part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . in many ways it reminds me of the cult movie pi , a film i disliked , and i can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? oh well i guess following gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand imdb members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of memento ?

first of all "mexican werewolf in texas" is not a werewolf movie. this title is bullcrap. the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas. i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. and i guess it actually works because that's the reason why i bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. anyway the movie isn't any good. actually it's bloody awful. but i didn't expect anything else when i bought it. it's a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster. if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. but i must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen. the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. they almost never say a line in a normal way. they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. it's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. it's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. she's the worst of them all. i have never seen an actor as bad as her (and i've seen pteradactyl). even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it. i hate her.some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. the gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. the effects are pretty hilarious really, but that's the way i like it. the chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit.overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.

i must say i was disappointed with this film. although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply plods along too slowly.granted, in another mood i would have liked it better. i did chuckle a lot, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won. but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day (one neither of us had heard of before) this one paled in comparison.if you see lots of movies, then by all means see this -- it's distinctly better than your average fare. but if you (like me) have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining, save this for later.[rate: 7/10]

if it had not been for christopher guest's hilarious role, i would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. the jokes were flat, the movie choppy and slow paced, certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch, but guest's character kept me laughing so i stuck with it.i do feel there are much better choices out there!

i could not stand the woman who played the mother. i wanted her to shut up. she had a bizarre manner of speaking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better. i had no idea why the men of the town were so taken with her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. even after a terrible tragedy her voice was devoid of human emotion, she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life. she delivered her lines with the same emotion whether she was saying "i love you", "i hate you", "the bank is foreclosing", "my dress is on fire". was this actually filmed in ireland? the sun blazed throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest. i lived in ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer in a century. most everything was still harvested. if the farmers in ireland could only harvest during long dry stretches then the country would have starved hundreds of years ago. it seems as if there wasn't a lot of money to make the movie. the black and white flashbacks looked as if they were filmed with the security cameras one can get at sam's club.

like the previous commentator on this film, i too found myself in tears at times during this movie. sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe-inspiring awfulness comes into existence. from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses (what irish emigrant hasn't had that one), its clear we are in trouble. and it doesn't get much better.whisked back to 1950s ireland, we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation, and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war. schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances. remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war. the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget...the civil war. every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war.the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland. the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic: house prices. if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland's obsession with its past, it fails miserably. it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies. however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche.for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland: it doesn't. 1950s ireland was a horrible, poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves. however there was more than one topic of conversation.

on humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair. the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed. it's not half as good any of those films.in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton. it comes as quite a shock to mackaill. she considers a show business career as a way for an income.bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in bogey.considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair. the part doesn't wear well on him.love affair is your average b program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.

the most stupid of seagal's movies i've ever seen. the final scene is just crescendo of stupidity. my recommendation - if you really like steeve seagal's movies, never , never rent or buy this one - do not repeat my mistake and keep a good impression of him, which i've lost

wow, i haven't seen a movie this bad since "fire down below". wait, that's a seagal movie too. like "on deadly ground" and "fire down below", seagal centers the movie around his environmental awareness message and how the military, fbi, and cia are incompetent idiots. problem is that both reality and a sensible plot are secondary to whatever gobbleygook social commentary seagal is trying to get across.

apart from some quite stunning scenery, this steven seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend any time watching it. for a seagal movie it has very little (almost no) action but he does put in some reasonable (for him) acting in contrived character development scenes. not recommended. to anyone.

steven seagal has made a really dull, bad and boring movie. steven seagal plays a doctor!!!!!!???! this movie has got a few action-scenes but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. a group of american nazis spread a lethal virus, which is able to wipe out the state of montana. wesley(seagal`s character)tries desperately to find a cure, and that is the story of the patriot. the patriot is an extremely boring film, because nothing happens. it is filled with boring dialogue, and illogical gaps between events, and stupid actors. steven seagal has totally scre#¤d up in this movie, and i would not recommend this guff to my worst enemy. 3/10

this film is without a doubt the worst action film i have ever seen. i am sorry, but it is just pathetic. in fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be a serious one) is when a chicken speeds across the road, on foot, at about 100 miles per hour. this pathetic editing mistake makes the film absolutely hilarious for approximately 2 seconds, then it is back to "non stop, on the edge of your seat, as you try to find a comfortable position to sleep in, action!"

since i am not a big steven seagal fan, i thought this was a pretty good movie. it is apparent that his fans are very displeased with this drama that lacks an over abundance of martial arts and brute force.gailard sartain plays a self claimed patriot leader of a militia in a standoff with the atf for weapons violations. he surrenders with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus. seagal is a former cia agent turned country doctor that pressures himself to find the antidote for the lethal bug that has incapacitated a small town. his grandpa's native american herbal remedy figures into the salvation.notable appearances by l.q. jones, camilla belle and silas weir mitchell. my personal favorite in this movie is whitney yellow robe. she is stunning and appears to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role.despite the far fetched ending, this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action.

seagal was way off the mark with this film. i'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this, instead it had injections and cheesy music. even if you're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead.

forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form seagal. this movie simply had no substance. very long, drawn out, and boring. scenes were much longer than they had to be - the camera would often focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening. cure for insomnia. worst seagal movie by far (i do like some of his other movies). 1/10

[possible spoiler alert]it's unlikely that seagal will ever again scale the heights of lousitude he did with *on deadly ground* (mainly because no one's ever going to let him direct again), but he sure tries, don't he?this one's a typically brainless and badly-written little fantasy about how indian folk remedies are much more effective than western medicine. seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense, although he never explains why life expectancy in the americas and europe is so much higher than it was in 1492.kinda like he never explains how his supposed "water-fueled engines" work in *on deadly ground*.even the "action" in this one sucks.

you get a good portion of steven seagal environmental anxieties, and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes (or alternatively use parts of any remains of the horse whisperer). you then add a large piece of outbreak virus or similar (attention it must be more lethal and at least biohazard level 4) wrapped around a fat militia group leader. you add one teaspoon of martial arts, and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste. add the classic red indian herbs for the extra taste. serve immediately.what is the name of the film you get ?: the patriot. perhaps the worst film of steven seagal. i am sure that seagal tried to say something in this film except the usual i-am-a-cook (but-also-an-ex-seal) but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful.

this is a known fact, mr. seagal cannot smile, he can act, he can kick butt, there are faint smiles, no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie. we see an over weight mr. seagal as dr. wesley maclaren, who is in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter ayako made an appearance as his office assistant. story: okay so wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter holly. they sit and enjoy their red flower tea and omelettes and on the other end of town some over weight militia leader decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an antidote. problem, there is no antidote and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while. the cia are contacted and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill, wesley's daughter holly. so she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood. wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather, who is a native indian. together with his sister in law ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time. and to shorten the moment, neither ann or wesley are infected by the virus...hmm. one weak fight scene. terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stair master.

steven seagal's intent is to be commended, and his acting in this film is equal to that in many of his others, if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist. the problem i had was with two items of the plot, which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point.first, how is it that a carefully engineered variation on a nasty germ, whose antidote must be just as carefully researched and engineered by a big lab, is cured by drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains? and that grandpa's family seem to be about the only people who know anything about this?second, and this one really takes the cake: having gathered up enough of the cure to fix a whole town, wouldn't you expect the army to land the helicopter and start rushing bags of flowers to all the homes in this small town? no, they instead decide to sprinkle the flowers all over the town and force the sick people to go out and gather them up all over again. just plain silly, unless under native belief the power in the drug somehow depends on one's having gone out and gathered the flowers oneself.add in the cardboard nature of the villains and the unsuitability of the title, and you might think my vote on this movie is actually high.

an ear-splitting movie, a quasi-old-fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star madonna's comedic attributes. she does indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond-vivacious parolee attempting to prove she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light...big laughs). after an energetic animated credits sequence--which is much more fun than the rest of the picture--we have nothing to look at but madonna's black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion. what else is there? griffin dunne seems defeated playing maddy's keeper, while the poor-choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue. it's an unfortunate set-back to the talents of director james foley, who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s (but even katharine hepburn in "bringing up baby" had a human side). wretched. * from ****

i was actually planning to see this movie when i noticed it in my tv guide but after about 5 minutes decided time is definitely more precious than "who's that girl" could ever be worth. describing how bad madonna's acting looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film. this crap is an insult to movies and intellect. i almost never! rate a movie i don't see from start to finish, but in this case the former is impossible. 2/10

for people who have absolutely no idea of what a comedy is. that not only includes the people who liked this movie, but the people who made it. what could they possibly have been thinking? madonna playing judy holliday? please, she can't even play madonna (if there actually is a madonna). i hope griffin dunne was paid well. he deserved every penny he got, because if this didn't kill his career, nothing will. i'm sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it feeling like their pockets had been picked. madonna is apparently past the point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress, but you can't help feeling embarrassed for her anyway. she has no connection with the rest of the cast; it appears like she showed up on the set and said, "ok, i'm here, i'm gonna embarrass myself by doing the absolute worst judy holliday impression anyone's ever seen, now stay the hell out of my way" and then proceeded to do exactly that. i know the phrase "rotten madonna movie" is redundant, but it certainly fits this. it's painful to watch a totally inept and talentless "actress" make a complete fool of herself, but it apparently doesn't bother her, as she does it again and again.the only remotely funny thing about this "comedy" is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to make it. now that's funny.

**********possible spoiler********** madonna plays an ex-con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago. griffin dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying his boss' daughter. together, the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus...when you get down to it, this is a stupid movie. without trying to give away the plot ****possible spoiler****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that madonna was sent up for. what kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?!then there's the cops who are trailing madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! and let's not forget those same brides-maids who fought from the front gate to the front door, still all tied together! and i hate to say this, but that patagonious feline sure looks like a cougar! there might be only four of them in the new york city area, so they might be endangered there, but i know there's plenty of them in the rocky mountains (see "charlie the lonesome cougar" if you really want to see a large "cat" in the movie). and let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet... naw!the plot is there, but that's all there is to this movie. i was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and i was some-what of a fan of madonna, but that was the only reason i liked the movie, but since then, she's fell out of popularity with me, and i've faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing she's got that singing career to fall back on). it rated maybe a "5" back then, but it's fallen to "barely making a 2" over the years.

this is the epitome of bad 80's film-making, unless you are a pre-pubescent girl. riding on a big name like madonna, a story line that physically assaults one's intelligence and humour that is most suited for a nursery school. if there was ever any doubt i think this turd of a movie clearly displays madonna's absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel highly embarrassed on her behalf. the only thing i can't believe is that they ever let the director near another movie again. madonna spends most of the movie prancing around like an infantile rag doll, and talking like a baby. it is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was ever made was due to the fact that madonna was a big name in pop music at the time. do not be duped into seeing this awful attempt to cash in on pop stardom. stay away at all costs!

this has to be one of the, if not the worst movies i have ever seen. after watching this piece of sh*t i felt as though i should write to madonna and demand compensation for my time, but now i feel that i should write madonna and demand a great 80s album (considering she can't record a good album to save her life anymore) in return for this disaster. on to the movie itself, which can be summed up like this:it consists madonna jumping around acting like a spoiled teenager who lost her way. she is trying to impress this absolute douche of an actor who plays "the lawyer' in the movie. but, the best was the ending. i was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to my self, "that's it? that's the ending? what a piece of sh*t!". if madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this film, this movie would have single handedly destroyed her career. and the funniest thing of the whole situation was that i just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song "who's that girl". well, guess where they placed it?...................................at the end!

man i loved ocean's 11.smart movie. all eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.what on earth was oceans 12? what was the purpose of the twelfth person? i assume it's supposed to be zeta-jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? it was more like the story of brad and zeta-jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.with o-11, the gang were always a step ahead of benedict (garcia). they were always able to outsmart him. what happened here? he catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? the whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. so next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? puh-lease...this movie could have been achieved with just brad pitt, zeta-jones and 5 mins of matt damon for the switcheroo scene.slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. i tried hard to like it and i'm usually very easy to please but i'm really disappointed.spoiler!!! the twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.end spoiler.wait until it comes on tv or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this.

i was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere, when suddenly, the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself. oh how i guffawed. because it's sooooo funny, isn't it? we know julia roberts is playing the character of tess, and here they are, in the film, cracking the joke that the character of tess looks a bit like julia roberts. so julia plays someone impersonating julia. how well she does this, we'll never know, because 99.999% of the audience don't actually know julia roberts personally (and reading about her in hello magazine doesn't count). and then bruce willis turns up! apparently, he's julia roberts' best friend. well, he is in the film... how would i know whether or not bruce willis and julia roberts even know each other? i'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors - i just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do. anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist... the one with the little kid in it... you know the one? i don't, i've forgotten what it's called. willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office - how modest of you mr willis!the problem is that, not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly self-indulgent, it also remind us, the viewers, that we're simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort. you see, when i see a movie, i want to suspend disbelief and forget that i'm watching actors - i want to believe in the story i'm watching. when you start pulling the scenery down, mid- movie, you simply ruin the illusion for me.you know that a tv series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities, playing themselves (stand up and be counted the simpsons, friends, etc.), but this is the first time i've seen a movie jump the shark. i usually stay away from movies like that (e.g. scary movie, the naked gun, etc.). the trouble is, i honestly never thought the ocean's 11 films would go in this direction. what a shame.so with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience - the heist actually happened way back in the story, and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing. yes, that's right: steven soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up, point at us the audience and say, "ha haaa... you've all been had... thanks for your money!". then they give us the single fingered salute.well, right back at you. i didn't actually pay to see this movie... i downloaded the dvd for nothing. how d'ya like them apples? now that's a plot twist.

this was the biggest disappointment of a movie...:( sucks, cos i was really looking forward to it.all the twists were crap. they were all flashbacks!!! what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job. yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned, but if you walk away and go that's bulls#!t... what's the point? plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway! you didn't get to see the team operating at it's full deceptive and brilliant potential. there was not even one good heist in this movie! they were all rubbish.. including that french idiot's break dancing crap to get through the lasers... it's easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards! plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie.. and it was stupid then as well...also, there's no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie! what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie??? half the scenes don't even need to be there! the first one was classy. this was cheap! and it makes the whole team loose credibility. especially ocean himself for bowing down the bennett.

i had read the newspaper reviews of this film and i must say my expectations were very low before watching ocean's 12. i really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. i would rate it top 5 of the worst movie i have ever seen. why do i say that? first of all there is a story so thin that britney spears crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. the fragments that could be assigned the term "story" is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. the entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.the actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. most embarrassing are leading ladies (roberts and zeta-jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. damon, clooney and pitt aren't brilliant either. to be honest i really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie.=== may contains spoilers ==== camera and editing, sigh where should i begin. there are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. the camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - not. i understand that the scene with tess ocean (julia roberts) playing julia roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. bruce willis. why? please explain it to me! why???to summarize ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching ocean's 12 i recommend the former. make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ...

ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on. like a celebrity awards presentation, each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking "applaud now" sign. the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited, and at times, utterly unrelated to the story and confusing. speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the "look at me" shots and cameos. only matt damon seemed to actually "act" during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. as for the heist, the action, the drama....it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. horrible! horrible! horrible!

i felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined imdb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.the acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. i love brad pitt with george clooney. it works. the witty banter was still there too from the first movie. my question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? i thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. i have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.the part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.in summary, i felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. i still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with julia roberts acting like julia roberts. this movie made me sad and angry.

i really liked this quirky movie. the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv. it has a realistic edge, with a captivating story line. the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch.

while i was watching this movie i never thought i'd be defending it. it's honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot. there's no real characters to latch onto except the killer. some of the acting can be better, but most of it is capable.i know, a three out of ten isn't stellar, but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless, etc. i think it set out to do what it's supposed to fairly well. the lighting is minimal at times, more natural than most audiences are used to, but it's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film. in fact, at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that, but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work that's truly that bad.it's not particularly scary, but it is disturbing at times. there are one or two characters who don't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times, but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies.

kill the scream queen may sound like a good slasher flick but it is terribly boring and very dumb.kill the scream queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditions girls to be in his snuff film. he rapes and tortures them. this is trash that is not amusing, suspenseful or entertaining.the killer has no motive,okay maybe hes just sick...and very dull. maybe they could of gave a victim a story of their own. anything could be an improvement. it needed a lot more.they could of put just a little more into it. i love horror/slasher films but this is ridiculously bad.

could easily have been better. in fact maybe so much so that if the filmmaker hadn't tried even as hard as he did, it might have actually been better.on a good note. the lighting was reasonably okay. but pretty much everything else was lacking. wobbly camera work. (yeah, yeah, i know, that's supposed to be the style now.) poorly recorded audio. and editing that looked like someone watched too many ulli lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies.) to sum it up, the movie seemed to be a rationalization for the director/writer/main-character to get some young women naked, put them in fake bondage, and grope them, while saying "menacing" things.

this movie was absolute trash. the director and stars(?)should be banished from making movies forever. the paper-thin plot concerns a sleazy director played by the sleazy director (now thats acting) advertising on the internet for women to star in a snuff movie. there's no horror at all, the girls look strung-out and bored, the direction is pointless, the music is misplaced (heavy metal in a library scene?), and the lighting is awful. the director should have cashed in a couple more shopping carts full of aluminum cans and gotten a script, sober actors, and a few light bulbs. as it is, this is one disgusting, nasty, worthless mess of a movie.

terry benedict (andy garcia) catches up with danny ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in oceans 11) plus interest. he holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the night fox. the team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the night fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. put simply, this film is a complete mess. the masses may argue that it is "cool" and that clooney and pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to "hello" magazine and think that david beckham has the potential to be a great actor. the story is convoluted, it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (hello magazine readers). any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. whilst oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. this movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. it is as if the director and cast said to themselves, hey this isn't really working out, lets just have a laugh! indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but i was not. i will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. the addition of catherine zeta jones is largely annoying. the scenes where julia roberts impersonates herself (with bruce willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. the movie is so full of plot holes that it as if arnie has emptied an uzi 9mm into the film studio. credit can only be given to some scenes where the night fox uses caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. the final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. stick with the original.

i'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies, when you put them together that's my sweet spot: horrible sleaze. you're not going to get it in this film, though.there is certainly sleaze, in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, tied naked to various things. the sleaze isn't very sleazy, though. it didn't register very high on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive, nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened. they seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some crack.forget the effects, they were lame in the extreme. the lameness was contributed to by the bad acting; effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses aren't buying into them.cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better. in fact, that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable. as it is, there are a lot of dark shots where you can't see very clearly, and what you can see isn't looking too good.the horror factor is nil. null. zero. nada. zip. zilch. i've seen kids movies that were more frightening. there's no camp here, either. it's just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy, but doesn't even come close.

well, it wasn't a complete waste. armand was as usual very good in the movie,,,the whole turks vs german thing was kind of strange because i remember seeing bulgaria at the beginning of the movie...dint' bother to go back and check...the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in. never saw a movie where the characters looked italian, supposed to be turk, taking english(american accent and euphemisms) with german words. the climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me. in any case, if you have nothing else better to do, you can watch this movie..

first i have to say that i really love udo kier and have always had respect for armand assante but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie. udo does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible. the script is all over the place, the dialog is wooden, the "action" is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin. i really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself, "oh udo.....why???....why?????..". if you are a fan of udo or armand, please don't watch this movie. it will only make you sad for them.

this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen.the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenes.despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspect,her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell.anyway about the movie,well nothing really interesting to say,a neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol.while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town.armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes.the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie.the killing of the children,the involvement of the underworld,the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the "trial" of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie.the acting is terrible,the script just stupid,the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money.don't even bother renting this one.

i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made. a bulgarian-italian co-production set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all turks speak english with some turkish words in between, is hardly credible. the english vocabulary is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. apart from this, racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. and if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white. in order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face. i don't even believe they actually shot it in germany. there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shot. it's probably bulgaria with some german signs added here and there.

before watching this film (at a screening attended by the director herself) we were informed this had won the short film prize at the galway film fleadh. surely this result will give filmmakers hope, anyone can do better than this!how anyone cannot notice the flagrant rip-off of donnie darko in this i'll never know. the film is pure drivel, the acting cardboard, the dialogue ridiculous & the ending just flat! the only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how dreadful it was, in front of the director! yes that was mean, but liberating!at least irish film-making can't sink any lower!

this movie is just plain dumb. don't bother watching it; believe me, you're better off.long and short of the plot: a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children. in defending him, she comes across a wooden doll of pinnochio. she takes the doll home. pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people.this movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending. the plot is very bad and the dennis michael tenney's musical score is pitiful. the story, written by kevin s. tenney, is just pointless and evokes no horror or fear. this is a far cry from his work on night of the demons and witchboard, which are decent outings but nothing to write home about. his directing is ok, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good.in conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the blandest, most boring movie i've seen all year.

....you get this stupid excuse of a child's play rip-off! man, what were they thinking? first they mess with a rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make crap like this. fariy tale haters! well to be honest, i've seen this as a kid, and it scared me a bit a lot, simply because i was under aged with the assumption that pinocchio wouldn't do that, wah wah wah. but i've grown and come to think of this as child's play rip, a fairy tale bashing nonsense, and a lame tales from the crypt episode, or trying to be one at least, with a lame ending that was stupid, and it had many plot holes, and i still can't understand how it came to life. was it the work of an evil geppetto? then what, after a few evil deeds, he becomes a real boy who becomes america's most wanted? personally, i think the concept of an evil geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden killers, and starts a crime wave, funny. but this is awful, awful, awful, awful, awful! awful! stinky like a shoe, and awful! it sucked it sucked! if you want killer puppets, settle for the killer doll, specifically child's play, instead, no strings attached. or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down, watch leprechaun, or if you want pinocchio, watch the animated disnet version or live version with jonathan taylor thomas and martin landau instead. >>>>> -10/10(negative 10)

"ninja iii" is not quite as bad as "enter the ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. it will hardly please the fans of martial-arts movies, because there isn't enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence. as if the film wasn't already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic "the exorcist" rip-off. the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, which the director doesn't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher. i don't mind a little soft-core exploitation, but it must not pretend to be something else.

wow, this movie is bad. think "flashdance" with ninjas. the worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in midair, but you can see the strings. or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye patch (that looks like a coaster) that the good ninja wears. actually, there are so many bad parts, i can't make up my mind which is the worst. i can't believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made. the only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh at.

i saw this movie a few years ago, and man i never want to golf again. i mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved. and i'm not talking about "victimless" stuff like forging a scorecard. no no- based on what i've seen here, they shamelessly massacre policemen and golfers alike on hallowed country club grounds. judge smailes would be spinning in his grave. and do they repent for said sins? no no, based on what i have seen here, the typical response by a slain ninja is to take over the body of a buxom female telephone repairwoman and seek revenge. i find this morally reprehensible, and needless to say, after viewing this nonsense, i not only stopped golfing and talking on the telephone, but also decided to stop feeding the homeless.

following the movie that represents the pinnacle of the 1980's ninja genre namely, 'the revenge of the ninja' salivating fans were 'treated' to this bizarre offering that mixes ninja shenanigans with spiritual possession....the end result being not dissimilar in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a nugget of human poop floating menacingly towards oneself in a public swimming pool.take for instance the supposed 'action packed' introduction which is set of all places on a golf course(!) here we witness an evil green clad ninja slaying a group of golfers for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever (although i must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does irk me somewhat though...hmmmm perhaps that's why he murdered them?.....yep i can relate to that after all). actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist but this story line is never elaborated upon nor alluded to ever again!!!anyway back to the intro, the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin....and they have to keep on shooting him because he just won't stay down!!! yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and still he gets up to slay evermore of the law enforcement numbers.finally (after what seems like an eternity) our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappears.....or so it seems, for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the soil and upon our decidedly gormless officers leaving the scene to search for his body, he crawls out from hiding and staggers away.we next see the lovely lucinda dickey, a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition, here playing a telephone repair worker. from her high vantage point she happens to spot the dying (at last!!!!!) ninja. however, upon closer investigation the man, supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and grapples her to the ground. after a bit of a struggle our feisty heroine manages to break free luckily but doesn't count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them. it is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! his intention is to use her corporeal form to slay those officers who killed him (the few he didn't actually manage to wipe out initially!)from this point on, throughout the film, whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some overwhelmingly awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed unto her levitating towards her in a most wobbly manner!to make matters more complex, a particularly irritating police officer (who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average yak to shame!) persists in trying to win her affections (in a most bloody annoying manner!!!)......well of course it doesn't take the gift of preconception to work out that in a rather feeble 'shock' (less) twist towards the end of the film, he is revealed to be one of the officers she must slay!but wait there's some hope yet! step forward the one and only sho kosugi!yes, the ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever! golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that transpired there, he flies all the way from japan to sort the situation out (suspecting the worst!) in a brief sub story (that amounts to all of a few seconds!) sho's interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered sho's father/teacher(?) and blinded one of sho's eyes (thus necessitating sho to wear a really decorative looking sword guard eye patch!)after stealing his dead nemesis's body from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an unwitting abode for the evil soul, matters climax at an oriental temple (seemingly in the middle of nowhere) where our man sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects.now reanimated from the dead, the evil ninja and sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being........well yes you can probably guess.really this movie has only two things going for it, namely the always excellent kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always) and the lovely miss dickey. what a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a rancid pile of ordure.oh well, to be fair, i've seen a lot worse than this in my time although i certainly still can't recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their sho kosugi/ninja movie collections.

...and boy is the collision deafening. a female telephone lineman is taken over by the spirit of a recently-deceased ninja, strips down to her undies, pours tomato juice on her body so her boyfriend can lick it off, performs a seductive dance, then goes off to kill the policemen who killed the ninja she's possessed by. only to be hunted down by a one-eyed ninja master. just like in real life, eh? enlivened only by sho kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his declining to put his obnoxious kids in this one), you really have to see this to believe it. it's the ultimate mix of totally at-odds genres.

you can only describe this with one word and that would be wow!!! wow, i really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released. if you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists, right? however, none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that's the level of their martial arts skills! the actors are way overacting, the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense. this is the worst martial arts movie i've ever seen and i have seen plenty!

i remember catching this movie on one of the showtime channels. what stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in phoenix, arizona. i'm from there so i spot the locales easily.regardless, a ninja kills a scientist, because they wear yellow sweaters and golf, who is pursued by the police. it takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him, there are no discernible bullet wounds. his spirit lives on however when a woman finds her and touches his katana.from then on, she periodically gets possessed and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja. then another ninja from japan comes to kill the evil ninja. this might be a plot device from the previous two films, or perhaps a plot hole. all i know is that this movie is very campy, bad and entertaining. this is something to watch with a tub of popcorn, and several friends and give it the mst3k treatment.

you know, after the first few chuck norris movies, i got so i could tell that a movie was produced by golan-globus even if i tuned in in the middle, without ever looking at the credits or the title. what's more i could tell it was golan-globus within a minute of screen time. something about the story structure, the goofy relationships between the characters, the mannered dialog, the wooden acting (spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance), the scene tempos and rhythms that made albert pyun look like john mctiernan, the paper-thin plots and not-ready-for-prime-time fight choreography...golan-globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject matter and point-of-view.what can you say, it must work for them, since they've produced literally dozens of movies. you go to one of their productions, and you know exactly what you're getting. and it ain't brain food, folks."ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a long line of products from the g-g sausage factory, and offers the typical limited pleasures to the movie-goers' palate. you've got a bad ninja, slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. you've got a good ninja, pledged to stop him. you've got a westerner thrown into the mix so we americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured that "we can still beat those pesky orientals at their own game." you've got a love interest (who is usually also the worst actor/ress in the film) fencing with the hero. you've got your endless string of assaults, assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an arrow or throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye, neck, or chest. you've got your beefy white guy/bodyguards in suits calling a ninja a 'son of a b*tch' and throwing a roundhouse punch, only to get his *ss handed to him. you've got a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy which goes on for 20 minutes and just sort of stops like a roadrunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolution.ninja 3 is a little different, in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the bad ninja, so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and beefy white bodyguards in suits while under his spell. but all the other elements are there, as formal in their way as a kabuki play or a noh drama.i actually thought lucinda dickey was pretty likable in this film. she's nicely muscled and curvy, has great cheekbones and some athletic 'ooomph' to her movements, and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie. she can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. one extra start for her participation and good energy.naturally, sho kusugi is in here, and he pretty much dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. and just to show you how 3rd-rate and uninspired g-g movies are, the director and editor inter-cut the last climactic fight between kosugi and the bad ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement. i'm serious...for all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings, they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at marineland. i can only imagine how dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katana for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot. an enjoyable waste of time...but it definitely is a waste of time. maybe if you are a sho kusugi fan, or even a linda dickey fan you'd find it worth your while.

this is by far the worst movie ever made. i have no doubt. i have seen such crap as manos, space mutiny, and whatnot, and i can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle to science crazed.science crazed has no discirnable plot. something about a guy making a woman pregnant via turkey baster, and the child born *hours* later is fully grown, and ready to kill. of course, being a newborn, it takes him about an hour to kill people. the director loops footage constantly, and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death. there is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie, however the dialogue arrives about a minute after it is spoken.sample scene: the monster is walking down a hall. we know this because there is about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet. in between loops, we are treated to two women working out. repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. when the monster does show up, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in headlights as the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them. by the level of the acting, you would guess that the people are already dead.i know my description doesn't seem too bad, but trust me, i can not fully describe the pain that is science crazed.stay away, and boycott all video stores that carry it. :)

this movie had potential to be a good little high school thriller. instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting. the problem was there were too many unnecessary things. a fight with the boyfriend, random friends coming over to be killed. it was obvious they were just killing time. the main character was bland and uninteresting. camilla bell had no emotion during this movie. she was just there. another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. the children survive, so it's obvious they are going to let jill survive. the only reason this got a four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer finally comes out) is actually exciting.4/10

that's pretty much all i can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 carol kane vehicle. camilla belle isn't much of an actress, and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of jill johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller.but if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on tlc or hgtv. jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she's providing her sitting services, searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going "bump" in the night. as she lurks around corners and peers down hallways, we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like roman tubs, a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving, and the piece de resistance, a self-contained aviary and coy pond that feature a self-watering system.because the movie isn't compelling enough to draw us into jill's fear, we're distracted by the grandeur of the house, which isn't something you should be doing when you're watching a thriller. even as jill is pursued by the faceless maniac, we cringe because she's breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond, not because she's about to get murdered.the movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies, and the ending is anything but original. by the time it was over, i just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real. never mind jill and the kids she was babysitting.2 stars - both for the house.

what should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror, as high school student jill johnson (camilla belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker, while trying to stay one step ahead of him.the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there. the remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film. that's a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad. however, if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress, better director, writer etc. there's no suspense, everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens. at least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes.if this premise were to work, then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance. camilla belle gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen and throughout the whole movie, she seemed to be reading her lines. you get a lead role in a hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all! why did they hire this girl? sure, she's pretty but she can't act at all yet i suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up. the rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid, rosa. even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all.this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman. that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same. jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes, the stranger appears. he has to be one of the lamest killers ever. he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat. the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter. the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense. he was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good. the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that. it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer. in the end, if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie. rating 2/10

it's been said that some directors make small budget pictures look like blockbusters. albert pyun makes small budget pictures look like high school a/v project films. this film was pretty much lacking in all departments. practically every scene drags on excessively, the "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, rob lowe apparently equated being scruffy with acting, and the poor drab euro-pop numbers stop the movie to a dead halt. on the plus side, burt reynolds does a pretty good job with what he's given (which isn't much), mario van peebles is surprisingly decent and ice-t puts in another of a long recent string of b-movie gangsters. not pyun's worst work (urban menace), but certainly not his best (mean guns).

do not watch this movie, or.. if you are really mad at anyone, you can give this as a birthdaypresent. this is the worst movies i have ever seen. do not watch this. if you do, remember: that would be a self-destructive action. it is a shame that this is not voted lower.

i saw this movie a time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and i got voted down.. i tried as best i could to get the story, because some moviemag had said that this would be a movie that would be for rob lowe, that pulp fiction had been for john travolta... well.. we can all see that he not only failed, but he fell aaall the way down. this is actually the worst film i've ever seen, and i've seen a great deal of bad movies.. it's just not even worth seeing for free on tv.

crazy six is torture, it must be albert pyun´s worst film. even blast and ticker are better! i can´t believe how boring this film is! how this even got greenlighted? i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was. this isn´t good bad movie, it is simply bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.1 out of 10 (½ out of *****)

the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to burt's bits and then the end!!! he is the only reason to watch this!! i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a huge burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie!! there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie!!! absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie!!! this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate burt's worst!! rob lowe's worst worst hour and a half of my life

i'm actually too drained to write this review -- bad movies always do that to me -- but i feel obligated, as if it's my civic duty, to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing or viewing this god-awful mess-of-a-picture. please, please, just take my word: this is one you'll want to stay away from. it's so boring and dull, so insipid and uninspired, such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent. burt reynolds? wasted (despite his best efforts). ice-t is barely in the film, and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by ice's intense stare, didn't know what to do with him. rob lowe, as the title character, has never displayed so little on-screen charisma. mario van peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. surely, satan himself signed mario's check for this film. the plot is as weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music involved (the utterly boring club song seems to continue on, literally, for the first third of the movie). the film's look will prompt one to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced, like one of the film's forgettable female characters, to smoke crack from a pipe duct-taped to his mouth. and if you're looking, at least, for stylized, shoot-'em-up-type violence you'll get none here. this film, i assure you, i promise you, has absolutely no redeeming qualities! please, i implore you, avoid this flick! don't put it in and get suckered into believing that its pace will pick up, it'll get better, and evolve into a decent denouement. it won't. it don't. it can't! it sucks! now, you have been warned, and i can now go to bed (it's 3am - please forgive any resulting errors this admonition might contain) -- knowing my conscience is clear, because i've done my civic duty for my fellow man!

yeah, that's right. if i were to ask my friends this question: "what's the worst movie you have ever seen?" they might reply something like "armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "shriek", "plan nine from outer space", "the medallion", "scooby doo" etc... no - don't get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this movie is in. if the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so bad it really pisses you off; then you know nothing my friend.crazy six... i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie. both of us had already been through most of the movies in there, and on the "new movies"-shelf we see it staring at us. "wow, there's some good actors here man. says something about mafia, lets just get it and get out of here". this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life. it was also the worst mistake for everybody else: movie lover or not.watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water (or ice-tea....) until it reaches room temperature. watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death, if death is just blackout light and nothing, and then you realize you are just staring at your tv-monitor. not staring. you are actually paying as much attention that is humanly possible. this is no joke.this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie. it's not the kind of bad you can watch, point and laugh of, its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory. unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain. .... ... (hey! that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching it....)best regards from me to you albert pyun.-joergen

do not rent this movie. i ended up buying the "previously viewed" tape of this for $4.00. that was close to the price of a rental, so thought, i might as well buy it. i'm tossing it out after i finish this review. the movie which stars lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick, which is what i wanted to see, i didn't even get that. this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot. i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. by the end of the movie, we still don't even really know who they are. believe the hype, stay away.

crazy director....yeah, you need to be crazy to make a near movie. rob lowe was bad in his character, ice-t is always bad and burt reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. crazy six is an unknown movie, with some known actors...this is pretty weird. a bad movie with some good actors in it. it looks like the bad movie did an influence to their performance...it did! crazy people.....i give it *and a half out of *****

honestly, i didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time i was hopeful. having it be directing by albert pyun - one of the more well known b-movie auteur's - didn't exactly raise my hopes. i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly? yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. rob lowe, burt reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), ice-t and mario van peebles.it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. it runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. i don't know what pyun was going for here. i mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe i'm an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around. here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. crazy six isn't much of an action film, it's not much of anything really.i guess what's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie. the music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female vocals too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. avoid.

this is the worst movie ive ever seen. and i have seen lots of movies. me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. man we had lots of fun. this movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. but it makes you laugh! u will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. you wonder why? just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar. my mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin the cats.

i bought this movie for about 2,5 dollars at a local flea market. i thought that with the cast present in this movie (ice-t, rob lowe & mario van peebles are all ok), it would be pretty good. boy, was i wrong. this movie annoyed the hell out of me. almost every scene drags on too long. the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie. the rest is no picknick either. my guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer.conclusion: the current 1,9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. go watch some paint dry for 1,5 hour instead of watching this!if you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'mean guns'(with christopher lambert & ice-t) or 'postmortem' (with charlie sheen) instead.

the story overall, though quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. however, the movie was absolutely dreadful. the story was good, but the acting was terrible. i was crying the whole time because i knew i could never get my spent time back. don't see this movie. if you do, bring a pistol with a bullet in it, and a few bullets if you're going with friends. i feel sorry for everybody who had anything to do with this film. i also feel sorry for everybody who had to watch the film. avoid this film at all costs, and if your mother forces you to watch, kill her. hahahahaha! see! i'm a psycho now!!!! ikwtcbs turned me into a psycho!!!!

i had to read i know why the caged birds sing in my english class and we watched the movie after finishing it. after watching the movie, i regret seeing. it completely took away any of the impact the book had. the scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes instead. i was outraged at how the movie ended. almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to maya's growth as a person. if you have read ...caged birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book so i warn you not to see it.

a ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, worst screenplay, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely ununderstandable...if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done, judging by this one, the entire world movie industry would now be dead...a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who "think" they can make movies.i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us...

you would probably get something like this. i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence. of course, there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break, but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art. but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap". to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, i can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much. i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art movie) to portray a slavic woman as a half-articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three-legged stool.

first, i don't see how the movie is on any "best" list or how it won any awards. compared to la pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, la pianiste is gold. this movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much. the lead actor was annoying, i felt as though i never knew what was going on, and i was bored!! even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting, i wanted it to end.... as soon as possible. why did it have to be his sister and cousin? ugh. and why did thibault get mean? he just bipolarly turned mean. and also, was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about? who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in? i mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in french culture? european culture? i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that!

french cinema sucks! down with all these psychiotric visions with their my-god-am-i-cultivated distinguished attitudes! pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres! i'll no longer have a mind for that! léos carax, did you ever think about, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid??? maybe i'm too common to understand you? or had it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a frenchman the world can have? guillaume the to-be-guilliotined comes to his home-palace, mme. deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "here am i, darling!" in this moment, i knew, that she's in the bathtub, and we`ll see her lying in there soon. don't misunderstand me, i'm not prudish, and the incestous sex scene was the climax of the film. but this is, in berlin, we say "etepetete", what means something like "être-peut-être", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, the worst, seen that often in french movies i can tell! other example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in a mirror, combing her hair, and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushs into the room, breathless shouting: "there's no escape, there's no escape!" forty years after existencialistic sartres and consorts- what's new, what's exciting about? my god, there's that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? and when you're not, please explain much better, why!! born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza, no escape, is that the point?

the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub. she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal. the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.

i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off. but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation...."last year at marienbad" comes to mind. well, "pola x" ain't no "last year at marienbad". i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years. "pola x" achieved membership in that august group. in my defense, i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground - hoping things would turn around. however, i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances. "pola x" does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work. after a 10 year hiatus, that must have been bitter for him indeed. melville is still spinning in his grave!

pretentious claptrap, updating herman melville (!), about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long-lost sister who has been raised by gypsies. or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi-layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (the siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings). considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve (who at least gets to bathe in the nude), i was expecting a lot more from this one; apparently, there's an even longer tv version of pola x out there

it's difficult to express how bad this movie is. even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the smug middle-class mores of both the usa and western europe, this movie would have been a stinker. the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if that's the correct latin grammar); the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics (by the male lead as well as the females); the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's (or somebody's) breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie -- i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic. the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot -- but underneath his clothes, this king has no substance.

i enjoyed carax's "les amants du pont neuf" and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard. well, the first 10 minutes were ok, but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life. a sad disappointment.

i won't lie, i rented this film because it was an "arty" film with some possible explicit sex. i got that scene and catherine deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like "did i have a mother or father, i don't know" (paraphrased). usually delivered in long soliloquies.if you are curious about the transition of "art" to porn, might be an interesting look, with use of the fast forward button (i was still too slow!)

(spoilers)oh sure it's based on moby dick. totally obsessed and it destroy's him. it's a total folly. the movie starts off rather well, but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.the supposed half sister is never convincing. some very poor lighting effects. music is interesting. but little else. it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. i suppose if you like being john malkovich, you might like this. but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again, pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell. the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either.)this movie is severely boring, depressing, and poorly directed. not highly recommended. if if you like french movies. (go watch crimson rivers instead)4/10quality: 5/10 entertainment: 1/10 replayable: 0/10

this movie is so unreal. french movies like these are just waste of time. why watch this movie? even, i did not know..why. what? the well known sex scene of half-siblings? although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story it is based upon is so unreal. what is the use of it, then? can you find easily in life, half sibling doing such things?did i learn something from this movie? yeah: some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies, such stories, such non-sense. but for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there you are.. you've got to see this movie.only one worth adoring, though: catherine deneuve. she's such a strikingly beautiful woman.

i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. at least he'd have wound up with something.the film struck me as pointless, rambling, and very stylish, like some other recent french films. not to knock it. most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever. we should be grateful, i suppose, for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind-blown continental winter, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up.but there can be too much of a good thing. golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night, carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such. (there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. you'll love it if you're vlad the impaler.) lots of people die. catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. i don't know why. golubeva's young girl dies too, and i don't know why she dies either. she gets slapped in the face, falls to the pavement, and dies.there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too. i'll have to take their word for it because, although it is stylishly photographed, it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. don't worry about the kiddies being shocked. they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway.depardieu isn't a bad actor. as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man -- well, handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way -- to a limping, murderous, hairy physical wreck, we feel sorry for the guy. golubeva has a wan pretty face, with enormous half-lidded eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. her next movie should be a remake of lewton's "i walked with a zombie." then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. i guess it's a band. as far as i could make out, the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of "easy listening" might not enjoy it. if you don't like the music, there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieu's walking stick.i must say, i found it barely worth sitting through. (and it's a longie, too.) at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by, sometimes stopping entirely. i wish it had had a few jokes.

i want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the english subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. but if so, director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g., david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky). others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., krzysztof kieslowski, and david cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). in pola x, carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. i liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to andy warhol's 'factory' of the '60s?). much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. and, even well into middle-age, cathering deneuve shows that she still has 'it'. her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos.there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as "pola x" more charitably. experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn't work. but carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. at this early moment in the 21st century, one is left asking: with the exception of jean-pierre jeunet, are there *any* directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore? rating: 3/10.

this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen.we are supposed to like and be rooting for an arrogant, know-it-all, trashy bank robber, played by dale robertson, and a coy tease played by the extra-ordinarily beautiful linda darnell in a fire engine red dress. she must have been sewed into that bodice! a senator in the film thinks native americans and whites should try to come to an understanding, the bigots, however, win the day. i could barely sit through the endless dialog of bigotry that issued from the other characters mouths.except for wounded knee and dances with wolves there are few films that give a positive portrayal of american indians, and very few old westerns do. this one is exceptionally bad in that regard.the romance between robertson and darnell set my teeth on edge, as he came swaggering in, forcing a kiss on her, while she plays the old hard to get game.there are scenes that are unintentionally humorous, such as the characters obviously not really riding in or on a stagecoach in several shots.a puzzlingly humorous incident in the storyline is linda darnell's character going to great lengths to purchase tickets for the stagecoach, only to then demand a horse to ride, minutes later, for no apparent reason.another humorous scene is when the stagecoach comes to a screeching halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road, and not only that, but then all the passengers pile out for a look-see.1 star.

scenarist frederick fox's sometimes memorable dialogue and a study cast of old-pros cannot save this lukewarm western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty cheyenne indians. other than his occasionally catchy dialogue, you won't find any surprises in fox's screenplay about this run-in between whites and indians. the characters in "dakota incident" generate only minor interest, certainly not enough to make them stand-out as much as some of fox's choice dialogue. unfortunately, good dialogue is fox's only contribution because this conventional little sagebrusher withers with a lackluster ending that contradicts its previous 80 minutes. the ending is as contrived as they come and lacks credibility. most of the characters are sympathetic, but some just plain lack common sense.dale robertson is appropriately tough and leathery as outlaw john banner, one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his low-down, no-account partners. veteran western character actor john doucette (rick largo) fares the best of the badmen, while skip homeier, wasted in an inconsequential role as banner's brother frank banner, later dies from an indian arrow. doucette tries to gun down banner at the outset of in the action, but our left-handed gun-toting hero fakes his own death, tracks down largo down later and slaps leather with him in a town called christian flats. naturally, largo bites the dust this time, but banner makes an interesting discovery. one of the passengers on a stagecoach from christian flats to laramie turns out to be none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money. not only is john carter (john lund) on a quest himself to find banner, but also he wants to clear his own good name with the bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest. evidently, the authorities have mistaken and enlarged carter's role in the robbery. carter is prepared to take banner to laramie and turn him over to the law, but banner has other ideas about laramie. banner's ideas change when he crosses paths with amy clarke (former twentieth century fox beauty linda darnell) who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a bosom. as everybody else here has mentioned in their reviews, republic studio's truecolor brings out the red in everything, from darnell's fetching outfit to the blood spilled on the ground. the problem with director lewis foster's handling of this run-of-the-mill oater is that everything bogs down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hole up in a dry wash to defend themselves against the cheyenne. the good guys and the cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition, but "dakota incident" never runs out of clichés. ward bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the redskin. by the time that this 88 minute dust-raiser concludes, you'll feel like you've been trapped in a gulch and menaced by marauding cheyenne yourself.

dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i've ever seen. not good, but definitely strange.a driver-less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed. it's scheduled to go on, but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the cheyennes on the warpath out there. but linda darnell, regis toomey, john lund, whit bissell, and ward bond each have their reasons for going on. and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert, is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team.of course the cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film.dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j. yates pulled the plug on his little studio. westerns were their specialty, but normally of the kind roy rogers made. this would not have been a rogers product. in fact it's beyond belief. the characters aren't ground in any kind of reality. whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim, but robertson discovers it's iron pyrites, fool's gold. toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst. darnell is after a cheating manager of her's, but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him. lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for, but has to bring him in alive. for that he'd require help, but doesn't have any.but the worst is ward bond who's a united states senator on his own peace mission to the cheyennes. in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. he's really quite the fatuous fool, but i think that might have attracted him to the role.i tried to get into dakota incident, but couldn't. and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least.give it three stars for the cast involved.

this might have been an excellent flick. however, as many other people think so do i. it is poorly done due to the languages transfer. if the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else. it does have an excellent rating as far as i am concerned and i couldn't wait to rent it. but, once i did it was a real let down. out here in boardman, ohio i could not find an english version to anything similar. this movie was also compared to dark hours and this we will not get to watch in boardman, ohio. it is not available. so i guess we will never know how good the movie actually was.

there's something rotten about this film, and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his admittedly horrible situation. sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. the fact that he has been contemplating it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse, but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks, even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong. what a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist stephen hawkings, who suffered a far worse condition for far longer! yet with the morals upside down, the film revels in hero worship, and the people who disagree with are painted in simplistic idiotic terms. there's little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest(deliberately manipulating the real life encounter which was with a much younger priest). in that way i suppose the film is on a par with riefenstahls triumph of the will. the insidious idea is that everyone should have to right to take their life, when they feel they cannot live it anymore. it makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people evidently who believe you have the right to choose. the same people are likely to make a case for abortion. its all part of the current trend to get the suffering or sufferers out of sight, brush it under the carpet, mammy will say its. ok, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. so we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives, just ain't worth living, and then we'll decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves then we'll bring in the state to decide for them. enter adolf hitler straight from that other oscar contender "der untergang". hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what nature does in disposing of the weak. under his regime, there were forced abortions among the "weaker" strains", the mentally handicapped were quietly put away and the jews were "humanely" liquidated by using gas. he would have applauded this film, and why not for it is in line with his philosophy..."some lives are just not worth living". i differ from ramon sampedro, hitler and all the people involved with making this film. human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and an obligation. nobody chooses to be born. then who can choose death. its not about religion, its about protecting the weak and helpless, something this film does a lot to undermine!

great. another foreign film that thinks it's fellini. on top of that, we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people.i see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercials.i found nothing redeeming about this film. what can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on, in spite of some adversity. it does not take courage to commit suicide. that is the action of a coward. sharing this "wish" with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has. if this had been a film about a man's courage to go on, in spite of his problems, similar to the jill kinmont story, that would have made it a great film.if you're interested in seeing true courage, check out the movies about jill kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident.

bardem is great. actresses are great. but amenabar did not have to do it like this. it is ok that he defends his position on the euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. but doing it like this makes him lose his point: the movie is a false, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. women are incredibly attracted to this mind-sick man who wants to make someone to kill him, not understanding the implications of that. he seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring, love and attention. i think that amenabar might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it i believe is not correct. he could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it.

first, i would like to admit that chokher bali was not my cup of tea. this movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses. it's the type that critics would enjoy watching. the hype and publicity were quite misleading.i was expecting something very dramatic like devdas. understanding that the story and time-period demand it, i found the movie extremely slow-paced.i'm a die-hard aishwarya fan, and i regret to say that i thought she was miscast. the role of chokher bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. everyone else gave a good performance. tagore's depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.

for the people who have compared this trash to the brilliance of david lynch etc... please listen to your carer when they say... dont use other people's pc without their permission! this is complete and utter poo! there is no art here. this is some person trying to make a name for himself with a cluster of gross out ideas which he was not clever enough to enforce into one main idea so instead he went for the easy option. any one with half a brain could sit at home and conjure up some controversial images to shock viewers, but it takes a person with true imagination to be able to make it into a movie people want to watch.i am a lover of shock cinema. i have seen or own pretty much all you can get... and i can strongly advise to anyone who loves the world of movies to steer well clear of this garbage.this one is only for people who like to over analyze what they are watching, or for the 17 year old first time drinkers who dont know any better.0/10!

critics are a strange kind of people. some of them are common people like you and me. some of them are not. when a critic say subconscius cruelty is beautiful i wonder where they did grow up? what's beautiful with filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it with style and capture the mood of the environments. karim hussain for sure can't. i've seen kids do better footage than karim manage to do in subconscius cruelty. but that's not the worst part. the worst part is the whole recording, i refuse to call this a film, is just a bad excuse to picture nudity and extreme torture, rapes of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, pissing, cannibalism, child-murder and much much more. i love gore/splatter and i love horror. this ain't neither of those. this is utter crap and if my comments make just one single person skip subconscius cruelty it's been worth it. always remember that your life won't last forever, don't waste two hours of precious time on subconscius cruelty. you've been warned.

i´ve seen this at the fantasy filmfest in cologne and left the cinema halfway through this "movie" (with a bunch of other people), so maybe i´m not the right one to comment on it, but i think the fact of leaving "s.c." is reason enough to do so. "s.c." is a different film. people who need a coherent narration, characters or a plotline won´t find anything in this one. it´s supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. but these images have no power. they are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out, that they have nothing else to say. the gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the visuals are cheap. ok, the effects are good, but if that´s the only thing, why care? husseins film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. note: not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore - especially not if everything is executed as bad as in "s.c.". i´d suggest director hussein should either visit a psychiatrist or a filmschool, before he mistakes crap for art again. note: i never want to see a baby getting slashed during birth again.

this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made. the only thing i liked is using argento-esquire lighting in most of the scenes. the music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at 2x the speed and even then it would be slow. the story doesn't exist. it doesn't even have any shocking scenes.it is classified (on this site at least) as a horror, but it's not. it's a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature. if you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace, then watch it, but i'd rather recommend you something japanese (e.g. ichi the killer) i think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie. these 80 minutes of it's length would've been better spent watching the paint dry.i gave it 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu

didn't the writer for this movie see the other three? i loved the original, i thought 2 was the best, i tolerated 3 (it was ok, nothing special). but i hated this one. who dare they kill off ug? this was certainly not the ug who had been almost like a brother to charlie in number 2. remember his speech? charlie said, "you wouldn't just leave me on earth, would you". ug replied, "charlie, bounty hunter", saying that he was now one of them now. how dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who get's killed by charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized the movie was getting boring. in fact for the first 20 minutes, we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to charlie, who was the hero we've been waiting to see. i kept waiting saying, "come on, when's charlie going to appear?" angela basset must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this turkey. moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. i think the writers decided, that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted. this movie is totally out of line with the first two. and it didn't even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3. 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and mean-spirited (eric dare) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. i hated this movie. hated, hated, hated it. i hated the fact that anyone could like it and i hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. i give this a one start simply because imdb.com won't let me give it a zero.

trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this film falls down in two of these. it does indeed take place in space - but it is neither funny or scary. the plot is dismal and the one joke, concerning the computer's intellect, is overplayed to death. saying that paul whitthorne as ethan, angela bassett as fran and brad dourif as al bert make the best of their ham script. the homo-esque relationship between ethan and al bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so crude as to be laughable. all in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv, preferably whilst do the ironing.

(small spoilers) i just bought the dvd of this movie yesterday. i saw it with my friends and i couldn't believe what had happened.in the first 3 movies, the critters at least had a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance, they weren't funny! they never made me laugh. i must admit that the story did start off nicely. after an hour had gone by i remembered that the critters movies were always very short. so i thought to myself, "where the $^%#$ are the critters?!?!" they were barely in this movie! if that didn't make me mad enough, the boy named ethan was sitting on his bed after charlie had "murdered the ship" and he knew that the critters were still on board! in the first movie the brown family was scared out of their minds. but here, ethan didn't even care! it was as if the critters weren't even a threat!now what i'm about to say next may ruin the ending, but i'm going to say it anyways. in the first movie, at the end, they had to face the giant critter for a final battle. in the second one, there was the great ball of critter. in the third movie, the critter with his fave burned did a spindash (from sonic the hedgehog) and was going to attack the little kid. but at the end of the fourth one (which is what made me the angriest) the bald critter charges toward ethan, and ethan kills it as if it were nothing.now something that i really don't understand was what happened to ug. he was one of my favorite characters in the first two. then after 50 years, he's evil. that was very disappointing. not only that, but wasn't he a faceless bounty hunter? why was he still "johnny steele?" plus he seemed to have a different personality. he seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two.being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies, and loved the third one, i give critters 4 a 2/10

this is a disgrace to the name of all of the lovable and laughable critters' saga. why do the writers feel the need to make the movie unbearable to watch by all quality standards. the critters are cute and adorable as ever but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby. they aren't as terrifying, gruesome, some what spine -chilling and funny as they were portrayed in the movies before. i used to love their porcupine shots but now it is hidden as if it was thought to be repetitive and boring. and what is with the killing and not eating. i thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong. why did ug have to be evil and killed by that which is known as charlie. this movie sickens me. disgrace! disgrace! disgraaaaaaace!!!!

critters 4 starts, & i quote 'somewhere in kansas 1992' & a replay of the last few minutes of critters 3 (1991) as the recurring character of charlie mcfadden (don keith opper) is about to shoot the last two remaining critter eggs in the universe which, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the entire critter race which is against some sort of intergalactic zoological law or something like that. charlie's bounty hunter friend ug (terrence mann) is now known as counsellor tetra & is a top ranking official at the intergalactic council & orders charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a pod that will land nearby very soon, the pod does indeed land nearby very quickly & charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the pod which i presume cryogenic-ally freezes him as it's never really explained. critters 4 then informs us that we are 'somewhere in saturn quadrant 2045' where a salvage ship comes across the pod drifting in space (the credits have barely finished & critters 4 is already stealing entire ideas & scenes from aliens (1986)). rick (anders hove) decides to claim the unidentified, to them anyway, pod & try & make a bit of cash out of it. with the help of his crew, ethan (paul whitthorne), fran (angela bassett), al bert (brad dourif) & bernie (eric dere) the pod is successfully recovered. they get in touch with the intergalactic council & counsellor tetra say to go to an abandoned space-station where a trade will be made for the pod & it's contents, tetra also specifically tells rick not to open the pod. so in true horror film tradition rick opens the pod, thaws charlie out & the critter eggs which hatch, kill rick & escape into the space-station...co-produced & directed by rupert harvey i thought critters 4 was a pretty useless film & rounds the critter series of films off with a whimper rather than a bang. the script by joseph lyle & david j. schow is both predictable & clichéd, the space-station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours, the protagonists only means of escape being neutralised early on so they are stuck, the race against time to save themselves, the constant bickering & arguing amongst the crew, people splitting up & the loser who turns into a hero & saves the day, yawn. a lot of plot devices seem to come straight from aliens & it rips off star wars (1979) with a tacky waste compactor scene. the characters are no better & you probably won't give a damn about any of them. while the other critter films could be described as comedy horrors part 4 cannot, it appears to be deadly serious throughout. critters 4 is also incredibly slow, uneventful & dull. it's over 30 minutes before the critter eggs hatch & after this brief sequence it's nearly the hour mark before their seen again, why make a critter film & barely feature them? it can't be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove puppets anyway, oh & how can a mere hours old critter operate an entire space-station & set a course for earth? how do they even know what earth is? why did capatin rick want to open the pod anyway? what is all that stuff about with the female scientist & a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once? why do the intergalactic council want the critters so badly? why only send four men? why is this perfectly good looking space-station totally deserted again? critters 4 looks cheap throughout with bland, dark unimaginative sets & it even steals footage from android (1983) for it's ships & space scenes, critters 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects & the ones it takes from android look seriously dated. for the most part only two critters are used although some-more start to hatch but it's pretty late in the day when this happens, for most of the film they are barely seen & the effects for them are the worst of the entire series. forget about any blood or gore as the critters only kill two people during the 90 plus minute running time which just wasn't enough to maintain my waining interest. the acting is pretty poor as well with angela bassett's over-the-top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few critter eggs particularly cringe worthy. to look at critters 4 it is as cheap & unspectacular a production as you could hope to (not) see. the ending of critters 4 has the universe finally being saved form the critter menace, lets hope it also saves us & our local video-stores from the menace of a part 5...

i haven't seen this movie in years, the last time i did i was really drunk after 5 pints of tenant's at my local witherspoon's but even then i though it was quite awful. this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies, the first two were quite good, 3 was quite crap but miles better than this. the story takes place 53 years after critter's 3, were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space miner,em,people and taken on board. once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship, cue an obvious 'alien' rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell. only good thing is when we are re-introduced to ug(or so we are lead to believe) who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them

sending the critters to space does seem like an entertaining idea, but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one? a film with brad dourif can't be all bad, can it? well, maybe in this case. this cheap sci-fi effort stars returning lovable klutz charlie(the reliable don keith opper) who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the critters' species when ugh(terrence mann)tells him that he's about to break some sort of trans-galactic endangered species law. so at ugh's request, charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod. unfortunately for charlie, the damn thing takes off for space and he's trapped inside. the smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepitspace station as captain rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malevolence, and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade. rick, unbeknown-est to him, lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh. you see rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it. ugh reports to them(now in a fine, prominent position as counselor)that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the terracor organization. once the crew dock, they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition, but what's worse is the station computer angela. angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time. it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers. brad dourif is al bert, pretty much the impresario of computer functions(..and is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most level-headed and intelligent). he seems to be a father-figure to ethan(paul witthorne)who just wants to make it to earth to find his father..this story though doesn't necessarily reach it's zenith. bernie(eric dare)is primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on. in the film, charlie, after one critter enters rick's mouth and eats away at his throat{yuk}, becomes the crew's guide in understanding what they are fighting against. the film has some elements i found rather confusing{or for a better word, ridiculous)..the two critters grow in size quickly, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for earth, not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station. the crew are able to tap into a log from a dr. mccormick{anne ramsay, whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access card}which shows signs that terracor was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people. knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures. things don't work out that way because well-meaning charlie(thanks in part to al bert's "ancient" colt .45)kills a critter which had got on board, but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship. so many repairs on in order, but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers dock at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought they'd be. ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the crites for purposes of a cruel nature(representation of corrupt corporate governmental types?). this betrayal is what changes charlie..he has perhaps grown up a bit(a wee bit)and now understands that some people just change for the worse. charlie and ugh will come to a face-off over those critters..will the crew be able to escape a space station which has set auto-destruct? this film really doesn't exploit the critters as much as the other three films. i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise. the first film was a hoot..a really entertaining romp. but, by the time this sequel cam around, the critters just wore out their welcome. the cast, however, do give the film a boost. the critters do get to feed a bit, but their plans of global domination is under-developed. their role in the film isn't established to the greatest heights. i said to myself,you have this enormous space station with unfortunates trapped on board.. could you not take this idea and run with it? sadly, they don't.

during my childhood time i have seen the first three "critters" movies and enjoyed 'em.they were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous horror loving kids.i have never seen "critters 4",so i finally decided to check it out.my verdict:forgettable and pretty bad flick with strikingly low body count.the script by joseph lyle and david j. schow is both predictable & clichéd,the plot rips off "alien" and "star wars" and the sets look bland and murky.the tone of the film appears to be deadly serious throughout making it slow and dull."critters 4" was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects;the ones taken from "android" look seriously dated.4 out of 10.one to avoid.

now this is a real turkey by the overrated director franco, who gave us such classics as "las vampiras/vampyros lesbos". yes, i think that bad films can be great fun. i adore the hilarious howlers of doris wishman, dwain esper and ed wood jr., but this one proved to be too much for me. it is the first film i rated 1. where should i start? the screenplay is idiotic to the utmost. the dialogue is unbelievably bad. the directing seems to be nonexistent. the best music cue (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie "der hexer" (1964). and it's boring! poor shirley eaton and george sanders! in one shot sanders reads a popeye comic while his henchman torture a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). the only thing that baffled me was that franco promptly showed female nudity whenever i thought the movie would gain from it - this is real directing skill! still, i'm afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile.

take the secret agent / james bond craze of the sixties, mix in some concepts from sax rohmer's female fu manchu femme fatale and stir in some absurdest twisted revisionism by director franco - you have the man-hating lesbian sumuru, or "the 7 secrets of..." - better known as "the girl from rio" in the usa, recalling "that man from rio," which has nothing to do with this. yes, this does take place in brazil, we must give it that. sumuru, or sumitra as she's also referred to, is like an evil version of "modesty blaise," played here by actress eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in "goldfinger." there are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene). she controls an entire army of female warriors, colorfully costumed, and rules a city called femina or something (just outside rio de janeiro?). these concepts, which previously appeared in "the million eyes of sumuru," sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design & visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "some girls do," which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army. at first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, catches one's interest, but, after 15 minutes or so, you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.the plot follows what seems like a secret agent, a male, arriving in brazil with 10 million dollars. he catches the attention of the local crime lord (sanders, hamming it up as an elderly bond-type villain), who sends dark-suited thugs in bowler hats to accost him. this sets everything up for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious sumuru (the crime lord wants sumuru's secrets). sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that's one of the secrets. this sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace; there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening: one shot of an arriving airplane, for example, stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop, as if this had never been captured on film before. there's a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there's something unusual about it. the fight scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes. to add some production value, there's a scene of the real rio carnival about midway through. i'm guessing there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action, such as the lack of even real-looking guns - it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired, falling over unconvincingly. there are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted. but, mostly, you'll be rolling your eyes. hero:3 villains:5 femme fatales:5 henchmen:4 fights:3 stunts/chases:3 gadgets:4 auto:4 locations:6 pace:3 overall:4

there are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess shirley eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to. the result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). worth seeing only as a curio. (*1/2)

the clever marketeer is he is, jess franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like mario bava's ultimately sensational "danger: diabolik!". franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he could freely insert as much sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to. and he partially understood this very well, as "the girl from rio" revolves on a man-hating organization, led by a funky dressed lesbo, that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! unfortunately (for them, at least), the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss, played by george sanders. all the right ingredients are well-presented, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. the plot is rich on imagination, but seemingly only on paper, as the action is quite tame. the film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. there's a bit of nudity, sure, but too few according to normal franco standards. all the characters are sick in the head, so the least i expected (or hoped for) were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. particularly the veteran actor george sanders ("village of the damned", "psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production. too bad even he can't save "the girl from rio" from being a huge letdown. a legendary euro-smut filmmaker like jess franco could and should have done more with this concept. shame, shame, shame...

nothing i dislike more than a kung-fu movie that plays for laughs. it is the main reason i can't stand jackie chan (or his lookalikes). he was not always a clown, i must add. "my young auntie" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. it is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior. unless you are 5-year-old, i really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny. but humor is indeed a very subjective thing. personally, i think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. i did think leading lady kara hui was very good here. but i had such a hard time sitting through this one that i could not enjoy her fine performance. if you don't mind all the silliness, you might enjoy it. i know i didn't.

el padrino :the latin godfather - while this seems to be a straight to dvd/video type movie- my fullframe copy obviously looked cropped- so maybe this flick had a limited theatrical run.and the title character appears to more of a gringo than moi( i am half honduran). pretty typical rise and fall of a drugdealer movie with the a-list of b-list actors- robert wagner(drug lawyer),kathleen quinlan(crusading judge),tiny lister(mob enforcer),gary busey(child rapist),brad dourif(white power jailbird),stacey keach(bereaved governor),joann pacula(bereaved milf), faye dunaway(crusading lawyer) and galo make canote as an uncredited party guest.this movie is pretty lame- i only watched it to kill time before the skins game- the only thing that saved it was jennifer tilly as a crazed latina drug dealing assassin - she was over the top and sexy-skanky that it was fun to watch her scenes.not worth renting or seeking out. d+

a little while ago, i stumbled upon this dvd while browsing netflix, and with such an impressive cast, decided to give it a go.never before have i seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie (scarface) and failing so spectacularly.the main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. in scarface, tony montana was the self-proclaimed "bad guy." his spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad, it was a great (and the only logical ending) to someone who lived such a life.damian chapa, as director, writer, and lead actor, sees kilo as some sort of hero, or at least a complicated guy. however he doesn't want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic, sympathetic character. he was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood where his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. for reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned, he decides he wants to be a drug dealer, and actually drives to the bad part of town, approaches two dealers and says, "hey, i'd like to buy some drugs." he drops his father's name, and in apparently no time they are not only rich, the two guys who are supplying him are acting subserviently to him for reasons, again, never explained.chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. however, since he's dealt large quantities of drugs before, why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time? the most obvious case of chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a white supremacist/rapist played by gary busey. in scarface, tony montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself, it's done, he moves on. but in this case they ham-handedly have to make busey not only a rapist/pedophile but also a white supremacist. a little overkill, don't you think? i won't go into detail in this regard too much more, but their desperate message of "please like me! i'm a complicated gangster!" fails on every level. try as they might, i didn't feel bad, conflicted, or sympathetic when his buddies are killed (following a shootout), his wife is also killed (shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father, and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be ok to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car), and his eventual demise.suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy, his only achievement bringing the term "wooden" to starry new heights. busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role. tiny lister did well. stacy keach is playing his warden from prison break role. robert wagner is coasting for a paycheck. faye dunaway, while a touch dramatic, still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved. brad dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. and to give the film credit, it does one-up scarface in one way - jennifer tilly now holds the title of "most ridiculous attempt at a hispanic accent." (sorry robert loggia.) in short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a poor story arc, unsympathetic characters, and hit-or-miss performances. i'd advise mr. chapa to ease up on the forced sympathy next time - really, we don't need to like your character, we just need to be interested. better luck next time.

it's amazing that this no talent actor chapa got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal, pathetic, cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half mexican, much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old, i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as dunaway, wagner, keach, tilly and busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film. i doubt many people have ever heard of chapa and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs.

what is the deal with all these ethnic crime groups copying italian mafia related movies ? we all know the godfather as in don vito corleone, now we have this mexican one which is just a strait out copy. i cant see why other ethnic groups have to mimic and imitate italian mobsters, but it sure makes them look silly. they sure seem to be wanabee italians. i would much prefer to see mexicans perform there own ideas and like to see there own culture, and the way they do it, instead of copying ideas from the godfather trilogy. apart from that the movie was disappointing, seeing mexicans acting and trying to be italians is not my thing. after watching this, i'm now going to watch the "real" godfather so this movie can be erased from my memory.

i'm a sucker for mob/gangland movies, so i rented this movie. this movie is a complete train wreck. with all the big name actors in this film, i can not believe how bad it was. it was so bad, that i began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film. the actor better known as zues or the big dude from the ice cube movie "friday" does an incredible overacting job throughout the film. first thing i told blockbuster when i returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves. do not rent this movie, unless you want to waste two hours of your life. if they come out with a sequel, i wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. i will be more cautious when renting so called 'mob/gangland' movies.

some weeks ago, at a movie theater, i saw a movie poster of el padrino (2004) with the tag "the latin godfather". how lame have we become, i thought, latin just because he is a mexican? let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to latium, italy, so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why: we are called latin-american people because we speak spanish, a language based in the latin language that originated in rome now italy. so to place a tag in a movie poster like "the latin godfather", is not just ignorant, of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic. now about the movie, i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most.

a friend of mine decided to rent this thing, lucky it wasn't my money.. pretty much wasted my time though. a story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing/directing. maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over-acting :)(gary busey's character for example) all the over-acted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention (for all the wrong reasons obviously) where the movie in itself failed miserably. in short: a waste of time and money2/10

a great gangster flick, with brilliant performances by well-known actors with great action scenes? well, not this one.it's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well-known actors, that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie, without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in.first of all, the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy in it. the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is (when i thought the two hours should be almost over, i was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed).the action scenes look a lot like those from 80ies tv series - the a-team, for example. it's just that in the 80ies (esp. with the a-team) those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in "el padrino". it's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something (not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through).the acting fits quite nicely to the action. either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (dolph lundgren style), or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody (but unfortunately it's not).my advise is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.

well, i'm a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley. i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday. we sat down to watch it and it was so boring. i don't remember laughing once. it's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end. elizabeth is great in this though. maybe it's just because i'm a big elizabeth berkley fan though. if she wasn't in it i wouldn't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up. unfortunately even elizabeth couldn't save this film. just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life. it's a very forgetful film.

this movie might be o.k. if not for all the language in it. i think that the storyline itself isn't bad, but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie. i know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually, that's true, but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the guise of entertainment.i used to quite like robert loggia; he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his, but in the last few years all i have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them. if we had an award for over-use of the f word, he would have to be a contender. unfortunately, i think he's now lost me as a fan. when i see his name on movies in future, i will be thinking twice about picking up that title.look, i'm no prude. i use language sometimes too, in extreme circumstances, but when we're watching a movie it is for the sake of e n t e r t a i n m e n t, something which we hope will bring us some joy and escapism. i do not want to be reminded of what's happening out on the streets in any big city these days, and it's a hassle to have to wonder whether or not a movie is alright for my family to watch.i like matt modine too, but it's a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this. he probably did an o.k. job in the movie, but i turned off about 1/4 of the way through after having had my ears assaulted once too often by others in the cast. why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this gutter language? once enough actors, (especially the big names), kick up a fuss about it, the writers will stop putting it in the movies!i'm sorry, but i cannot recommend this picture. it's a pity too, because i think it would probably have been alright, if it had been made well enough for decent families to watch! thank god i only wasted $2.00 on it!

what happened to mathew modine's career??? i can still recall when he was considered an a list actor...was it cutthroat island the final nail in the coffin of a once promising career??? wow, this guy must really hate renny harlin's guts...this movie wants badly to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs, the characters are caricatures, and badly drawn ones at that ... but still what pains me the most is seeing mr. modine taking up on this kind of roles, next to actors so far away from his caliber, i mean at the time when he was making movies like birdie he could never in his worst nightmares have imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a hick humping a cow that just had her anus stapled shut, and maybe whats even worst;next to elizabeth berkley!!!

despite this being one of john cusack and demi moore's early films, it is one even hardcore fans can miss, unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. i have rare moments, where i can handle better off dead, but this movie is ultimately worse. i am just not a savage steve holland fan, and he did both movies. so if you don't like the cheesy, random comedy and amateur animation, steer clear of this one. fyi even for the demi moore fans: she can't sing and the 80s synthesizers did not save her. there are too many predictable twists and too-easy jokes. i suppose if you want mindless entertainment or something you can leave on in the background and ignore while you do something productive, then go for it. otherwise, don't watch this movie. if john cusack (or demi moore) couldn't save it, you know it's got to be bad. they are the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1.

savage steve holland wrote and directed his second film, one crazy summer, with john cusack and curtis armstrong again in a supporting role. cusack and bobcat goldthwait are recent graduates headed to cape cod in order to stay at goldthwait's grandmother's for the summer. along the way, they bump into demi moore being pursued by john matuszak and a motorcycle gang. soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being turned into another lobster restaurant by a conniving, spoiled family that considers "work" a dirty word. the film contains several funny vignettes like the millionaire dollar radio contest gags and the godzilla skit.like holland's first film, better off dead, john cusack adds immeasurably to the film. otherwise, this is a dud of a film filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to quirky). moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some horrible synthesizers. goldthwait's gags wear thin after awhile, and armstrong never was an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except grade z stuff. the tow truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the endearing underdogs they're obviously meant to be. this is more of a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy which could have used a better script and direction. *1/2 of 4 stars.

this is beyond stupid. two high school graduates travel to nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting.demi moore co-stars in this one. as the film was in 1986, was ashton kutcher just a babe in the woods at that time?moore's grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean.bobcat goldthwait, with that obnoxious voice is in the film, as well as two brothers, who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent.the writing is absolutely ridiculous. highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other: "did you ever notice that when people die, they go alphabetically in the papers?" i rest my case.

i hated the book. a guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all the while they're being chased by a hit-man and a ape beast thing (both of whom want the dog). dean koontz really can't write (i read the book at my sister's recommendation, i should have known better). when i saw this, (mostly out of a morbid curiosity) i actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book, even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of. i figured at least if they're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book i've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate. they turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason that bothered me most of all (even though i seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn't have made it any better). quite simply; bad book, bad movie, don't see it.

okay, my question; who's the idiot that wrote this movie, giving it the same name as dean koontz's awesome book? its terrible, nothing like the book...you got the dog, and the watcher, but there the similarities end...might be good, if you haven't read the book, though...but it disappointed me, really.they should make a new one, and let koontz write it... now that would be a good movie... i'll say it again, this movie disgusted me...absolutely disgusted me. it was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like the book. i would never again watch it.

i couldn't agree more. the book is one of dean koontz's best novels and this film is a total travesty. i watched about half of it then threw the tape in the bin in disgust! i have no idea what the idiotic director was thinking making this piece of crap but i would rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again! everything about this film is just wrong. first the main character is changed from an ex marine to a high school kid. why??? second the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! hem i bet freud would have something to say about that! lol. the dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely outcast everyone else! also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie. there really is nothing good to say about the film except that at least it's relatively short at an hour and a half or so. if anyone hasn't seen the film yet do yourselves a favour! read the book! it is so much better than this worthless waste of time!

based on the excellent novel, watchers by dean koontz, is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone. not since "the running man" have i seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition. the difference, however, is that "the running man" film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases. this film nope, nothing remotely amusing. in fact, if you love the book, as i do, you'll hate this bastardization even more.**warning**contains spoilers** rightio, i'm basically going to tell you the story here, almost in it's entirety. why? because you, dear reader, do not also need to suffer through this abominationit's okay for me, because i enjoy watching crap. because i like complaining about sh*tty things. now, on to the nasty: this film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature-soldier which escaped from a destroyed government genetics lab with a super-smart golden retriever which the "hero" calls "furface." groan trust me, in the novel, this story rocked. i'll get to that later. anyway, the hero is none other that dreamy boy-child corey haim. oh, i'm not kidding. our hero runs around, crackly voice and all, trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the "evil government" which birthed him and made him genetically ultra-smart. the monkey-creature, retardedly referred to as an "oxcom" (god help us) is also a genetic-stew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future. michael ironside (total recall, starship troopersalways plays a badass) is also in this film, and no, i couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea. he plays a government agent with the nso hunting the dog and creature. oh yeah, here's some spoilerama: he's also a creation from the government, and the same lab, and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing peopleand all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey-soldier. instead of a rockin' kick-ass, creepy horror film, we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick. the dog's intelligence is discovered all-too-conveniently, and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. breakdown!!change from book to film:--lead character (travis) turned from man to boy-child.--man's love interest in book (nora), is now his motherand all her depth and character growth is completely gone.--lem johnson, black man, is now white mr. ironside. this matters as the character's strength was built on his heritage in the book.--relationship between two authority figures completely ignored, lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend.--one principle character in the book is now totally absent, the "immortal" that hunted the heroes--maybe this is supposed to be ironside, but then why is he someone else?--dog never receives deserving name of "einstein" in the movie.--no part of the book took place in a high schoolat least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot.--takes place over a matter of days, rather months like the bookunrealistic pacing.--corey haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book--and they never met in the book.--character of lem johnson is no longer cool-headed; instead, he's a total asshole that bullies his way through people.--hero travis was part of delta force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead, his dad, who is never seen in the film, was part of that group.--perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent.--subplots involving soviets and the mob completely gutted out of the story.--these are just the most obnoxious changes, and the one's i could remember off hand (and a day later).the good:--eventually, after 90-odd minutes of pain and mental anguish, the movie ended.didn't hurt it, didn't help it:--michael ironsideusually, i like him.--the dog is still fairly likable.--wacky "totally 80's" title screen.the bad:--okay, the writing for one is extremely awful.--the direction is so half-assed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it.--the acting is crappy and weak, especially from corey haim.--loose, weak, watered down story.--the monster looks just pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. its head is gigantically over-sized, the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds. instead of a lean, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we have some jackass in a puke-ugly monkey suit forced upon us.--absolutely no character development.--even the violence and gore are done poorly, for f*ck sakes, this is supposed to be a horror film!! usually violence is at least done well!the ugly:--the idea that dean koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f*cking piece of sh*t brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me. there are movies worse than this (headache-inducing as that idea may seem), but so far, only "alien vs predator," at least to me, is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. memorable scene: watching the end credits start.acting: 3/10 story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is just terrible) atmosphere: 5/10 cinematography: 4/10 character development: 1/10 special effects/make-up: 4/10 nudity/sexuality: 0/10 violence/gore: 4/10 music: 5/10 direction: 3/10cheesiness: 7/10 crappiness: 9/10overall: 3/10i would recommend that no one watch this movie ever, except for a few extreme die-hard horror fansand only if you haven't read the novel. instead, i would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy/check/borrow the book.www.residenthazard.com

so many bad reviewers, it made me wonder, what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director??? did you all expected a super-hit flawless movie?? no way, you already can see, raj kumar kohli loves multi-starrer movies... all of his earlier works where multi-starrers, but no one was flawless. take the first jaani dushman for instance, so many flaws, but still good fun. anyways sticking to the movie, the movie jaani dushman is a hindi fantasy film about a snake, who can take any form (armaan (munish) kohli) which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover (manisha koirala) on the people who caused it. its quite good, with a great star-cast. but i think it could have been much much better. for instance, take the script, can't say its flawless. for example take the ages:do 40-48 yrs old still study in university??there are many many more, i won't list more, but there are dozen more. a solid 5.5 is good for this one.**.75

no words can describe how awful this film is. its like the director literally took a s*** in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public.the acting in this movie is horrendous, the plot is so dumb, and the deaths of each character is laughably bad. some stupid scenes include akshay kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), akshay kumar carrying a bazooka around the town, rajat bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton, rajat bedi and siddharth double penetrating monisha korella (how did they think this was straight?). also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. the scene that supports this statement is when kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses. the shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint.the best parts in this movie are with sunny deol. this man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared. in one scene, he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it. chuck norris' round-house has nothing on that! he is even so powerful, that he can fly from london to india in a matter of 10 minutes! overall, this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe. if you were to watch it, watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout (btw this movie is supposed to be serious)

oh if any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this moviethis film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in?the handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes infrontokay reasons to laugh at the film: 1) akshay, suneil, aditya panscholi, sharad kapoor, arshad warsi as college students 2)akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and sfxthere are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late? also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only?but afterall they have to make a 2 hrs + film so hence you have a tortorius moviethe movie is painful to watch the film was directed by rajkumar kohli who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like jaani dushman(1979) and nagin rajkumar kohli wants to help his son's non existent career right from virodhi(1992),aulad ke dushman (1993) and qahar(1996) all flops he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed, sadly nothing could help his son's careerthe film has several comical scenes like the death scenes, how the actors after being bashed by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climaxdirection by rajkumar kohli is bad music is badthat brings us to the cast akshay kumar - ordinary stuff, he has nothing much to do rather then stunts suneil shetty- awful sonu nigam- the worst debutante award goes to him, he gives cartoon acting a new meaning aftab- terrible arshad warsi- nothing to do sharad kapoor- bad aditya panscholi- irritates sunny deol- is comical in the scene when he comes to save sonu lol manisha koirala- ordinary rambha- akshay's pair kiran kumar, raza murad are as usual raj babbar- hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful which brings us to munish kohli this guy has a huge physique, he is even more stronger and taller then akshay kumar sadly he comes across as poor man's akshay his voice is awful, his expressions are painful the only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face rajat bedi is awful

friday the 13th meets the matrix. as with all of these stupid horror movies, everyone knows who has been killed and who will be killed next, but do nothing to prevent anything, all with the added cgi action effects from the matrix. hasn't the world seen enough matrix reproductions?

i am ashamed to admit in public that i even held the cover of this movie once! this is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it! the 'makers' of this movie have called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands.based on the mythical indian shape-shifting powerful cobras and rebirth, the story takes us for a painful ride. college going 40+ actors (now really?) are the target of their former friend manisha koirala (who was in her former life a cobra, but is now a ghost!) and her pathetic, eternal, powerful boyfriend cobra/killing machine boyfriend munish kohli (who thankfully hasn't been seen since). now do you need to know more?i vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie! give it a pass if you are sane. if not... then you'll probably enjoy it.

if you have seen this movie, then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made. bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies. who would of known that they will copy terminator 2. the difference between both film industries are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends 100 thousands (average). thats the problem with this film, if you want to make a t2 style movie, then do it properly. the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl (in the previous birth) dead by 2 guys, but the blame goes to 10 people. she suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death. not to mention, the reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers. he can transform into anything, he can fly, disappear, fire power, wind power, you name it, he has it. he even gets bazookered and survives the t1000 style. you are probably wondering how he survives. its best not to ask, and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. its best just to forget this film even came out. i think its a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline.

hi, this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. the day when i watched this movie, i was having high fever. but still i watched the movie with lots of patience. and after watching the movie, i felt like repenting. because, i wasted 3 hrs for this stupid movie. i could have taken rest rather then watching this movie. and i was really surprised that how come actors like sunny deol, akshay kumar aftab etc acted in this movie.i don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a film then why do they remain as directors? why can't they sit at home and spent their time at home? i request to all directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences, either by mail or by media, newspapers, radios etc... to send them a nice story if they don't find any good story for to make a film . i request again to all directors please don't make such films.

an insane assault on viewers senses. this is a mish-mash of assorted hindi and english movies - poorly done. the name carries over from a 70s' multi star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts of. the story is taken from the 70s' sunil dutt/reena roy starrer - "nagin" and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) from the matrix, terminator 2 and mission impossible ii.set in a college environment (sunil shetty, akshaye kumar, manisha - college kids!!!???!!), manisha koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros. as it turns out manisha is a cobra (nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming (ichadhari nag) - munish kohli, is out looking for her in this life. manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder.so begins the mad killing spree, where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. the effects are extremely cheap, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce.carry over from nagin includes raj babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more "religiously correct" multi-religion locket (the original nagin only had an "om") . sunny deol plays manisha's love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful munish kohli.music and songs are below average.avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills.

ok, i would give this a 1, but i'm gonna give it a two because i laughed while watching this film...first of all, i can make a much better movie than this one...in a week...the special effects made this film look like a joke. one shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously. the acting and direction was also horrible. the screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all. this has to be the worst indian film ever. the songs were also bad. the acting was bad and artificial. need i say more. don't watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is. that's why i watched it. i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get. trust me, i watched one of the worst films in history if not the worst film.

this movie made me laugh so much. it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. so unbelievable and the worst plot ever. the acting as well was bad. i don't how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie. the script must have been somewhat of a joke. the visual effects in this movie was excrutiatingly painful to watch. i believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot.the plot has numerous attempts at copying major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably. i laughed my head off seeing this movie. a total disaster in indian cinema history!

this movie beats everything out there. well, depends on what you are looking for... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. this movie is in a complete league of its own.. i don't think any movie could possibly come close to it. i am not sure what the director intended to make it as.. a thriller or a comedy. if he did think he was making a thriller, then he has by a stroke of luck, created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time. you have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's hindi movies, with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human).its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side, planning to laugh at the movie! i am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10.. on the basis of flipping a coin, i have decided to give it a 1!

i usually give sequels the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them. but thisis very poor. the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again. the exact same. only they wanted younger kids to be able see it (this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one 'f*ck' is beyond me).they didn't even bother to change jackie mason's character from dangerfield's. let me explain, in caddyshack rodney dangerfield played a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club. in this movie jackie mason plays a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club. a big effort they made to change the content of the script huh? no, i don't think so. a very unfunny dan aykroyd shamefully copies bill murray's character. he even goes after the gopher (now more like a gremlin) in much the same fashion as murray did. there is not a laugh to be had. a sample of the 'comedy' in this film: jackie mason is getting ready for a hot date with dyan cannon. he is in the bathroom is his robe. he moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom whenthe door handle breaks off. wow!?! that's the best they can do. eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we get!?! i could have pulled a better script out of my ass.see it only if you're a die-hard fan of the original. it's the only way you'll find any kind of laughs in it. everyone else steer clear.

this film should never have been made! it stinks, it's awful, it's no good, it's bad, it's terrible. starting to see a pattern here? jackie mason is certainly no rodney dangerfield. gone were ted knight and bill murray, who, along with dangerfield, were essential to the first film. it seems that the three of them (the stars) all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one. the one who didn't have the good sense to bow out of this was chevy chase, who stuck around but was extraneous to both films in my opinion. this film is quite simply not funny. nor does it have any other endearing qualities. this thing relies heavily on anti-semitism to work and it works to it's detriment. i hated this thing. a waste of everybody's time.

this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered. the cinematography was dull, with long tedious shots (like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made little sense to the content on screen. the editing was terrible, scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher. the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien. the acting was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).

i managed to see this at what i think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the dublin international film festival. while i was attending another film two nights later at the same theater, i saw brendan gleeson, paul mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another promotional screening of studs.i have to say that i was bitterly disappointed with the film, i was by no means expecting a masterpiece, but what was presented to me, i believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into. before i continue, two things, i accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here this is simply not the case. secondly, i know that it was based on a play (which i haven't read but have been informed that it isn't a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film.my main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it simply doesn't work, the down and out team are trying to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. having read so far, you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a "charlatan" of a manager and his hopeless team. it certainly does not achieve this, i'm not even sure if it was aiming to. any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. overall, i found the script lacking in many respects.i do think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well made. but aside from those points, which should be expected from any irish film at this stage, i left the theater feeling very disappointed.my judgment may seem harsh but i do think there is some hope for a strong national irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument. as studs has become a recommended dublin cineworld film (i was part of the audience at that screening), most people would seem to be disagreeing with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film.

this is a poor film. it certainly belongs in the how not to make a feature film category. story, direction, acting and style are all flat as a pancake. story consists of five  yes five  football matches spread out over the film's duration, each one more boringly filmed than the last, as a dysfunctional amateur football team go from strength to strength. that's it, that's the plot. it's hard to know who this film is aimed at. it's too banal for football fans and there's nothing in it for teens nor grown-ups. there's nothing in it for women either, there isn't even a single female character. it's dreariness wears you down as the team play game after game after game after game after game. the story, such as it is, dialogue and mannerisms seem lifted from a bygone ireland, with all the actors spouting cod theatrical dublin accents. it doesn't have to be seen to be believed. avoid at all costs. can someone give me back my 90 minutes. high point the credits at the end, low point too numerous to mention. brendan gleeson is in this film.

making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn't do anything for the audience. the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor.what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed.i don't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show.the deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written. what i would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. the film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social/political commentary.my overall impression was that the film was rushed, thematically under developed and visually not up to standard. on a positive note the performances and music were very good.

having watched the first scene, i realized the acting was so bad that it couldn't possibly pick up later. superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five year-old tries to make it sound as if he knows what he's talking about. the second-to-second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did, was the kind you expect from a below-average grade school student. the overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. the few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent, was limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. a ten year-old might like it. but it would take a five year-old to accept the lack of realism; how does advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if with a magic wand, pick out one out of 100s of voices through a ventilation system (thereby ripping off superman), and repair a home computer by just sensing whats wrong instead of looking for faults? actually, that scene is a neat example: the fault was that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum ribbons) on the cpu was broken, the way it would look if a exhaust pipe on a v8 engine is ripped off by an explosion. this is something that can't happen, and if it did, it wouldn't prevent the computer from working. there is no electrical current passing through this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, his arms worked by autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient) put a push-pin into the rip, a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting.and so it goes all the way. like when he escaped an interrogation room in the nsa headquarters by lighting a lighter below a fire sensor, resulting in open doors throughout the building. naturally, nsa didn't predict this sharp witted approach to escaping, nor did they put any guards outside his room (or anywhere else) to guard a living, walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology. so he walked out and got a cab. examples like this one are not only numerous, there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense. also, the so-called great effects were terrible. he threw a basketball back to a kid in the park, and the kid was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. no acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized trolley. i'm sure if i paused and looked for the cables that kept the posture of this kid the way only cables can, they probably didn't know how to or bother to erase them completely. if someone is thrown that far into a tree, they would at least say ouch (or rather be hospitalized with broken bones), but the kid was just just confused and amazed.moronic. that's the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production. i'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist, someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve. i feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it, and the time it took to write this. although it felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved. the only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily, would be imprisonment or lobotomy.

i was lucky enough to grow up surfing in san diego (not the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood, i'll tell you that) and i have seen a lot of so-called surfer flicks in my life. after watching north shore for the first time just now, all i can say is thank god i never saw this as a kid. if i had seen this and mistakenly thought that this was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene, i would sold my board and totally gotten into, i don't know, accounting or something.seriously, this movie has a as much in common with real surfing as top gun has was real military life. the acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is iffy at best and oh my god what was laird hanilton thinking?! wow!!! do not see this movie!!! it sucks!!! if you want a real surf flick, see riding giants. hell, watch surf's up instead of this. seriously. sucks. sucks bad. sucks real bad. brah. ;)ps: had to change my summery from "wtf?!" to wtf because, apparently, we are supposed to whisper on this site. no yelling!!! (shhhhhh!) ;d

this film has the language, the style and the attitude down ... plus greats rides from occy (a world champ) and the great jerry lopez. john philbin as turtle has the surf pidgin down, and the surfing scenes are still the best ever. a true classic that can be seen many times. nia peeples is a babe, and laird hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world's number one extreme surfer.

the bad news: the canadian version of beast in the cellar released by maple pictures that i saw was of poor quality. dark and washed out, it appeared to be dubbed haphazardly from a vhs tape. it even skips at one point due to some missing frames.the good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the dvd detracted little from my viewing enjoyment. this horror movie fails to build tension and lacks scares. it is a horrorless horror film. while most frightening films have limited dialog, beast in the cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard said by two other characters. presumably, all the chit chat acts as filler for a very low budget, unimaginative movie. unfortunately, the dialog isn't campy enough to make it worth a watch.

one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don`t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those amicus anthology movies . add the beast in the cellar to the list much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end . once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film . it does open with a fairly good hook but after that we`re treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk . correct me if i`m wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk ? the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the cellar is the anti-smoking stance . some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film but watch carefully and you`ll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed . rather strange considering attitudes to smoking weren`t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays

the `plot' of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through, but i reckon that isn't always top priority in horror. two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years. now, he escaped and started a killing spree, focusing on militaries that are homed nearby. `we only did we thought was best for him' they keep on repeating and  strangely  all the army officers love these women and don't doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of their men died. i don't know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful  or tedious! in a way, this film reminded me about `arsenic and old lace'. in that black-comedy classic, two half-insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well, yet they do the killing there. the old ladies in `the beast in the cellar' are by no means less crazy, though. the `horror' in this early 70's film is very amateurish and cheap, but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension. too many `old-ladies' talk about the good ol' days, though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title. flora robson, who may be recognized by classic film buffs, plays one of the sisters. she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film, the sea hawk.

i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid. i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years. i spent a couple of years trying to find it online...didn't remember the title, only the storyline. after searching and searching, i came across a vhs that was being sold on e-bay. i was excited and when it finally arrived, i jammed it into the vcr and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. needless to say, i was slightly disappointed. this wasn't the movie i remember watching as a kid. it was boring at times and i found beryl reid's incessant whinning extremely annoying. both performances by reid and flora robson were good overall but the movie wasn't scary. i think any movie is worth viewing to form you're own opinion but sometimes, well......

crash is supposed to be a film about racism in los angeles. but in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. who the hell is going to believe that? there are unrealistic situations, one after the other. on the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between asians, iranians, latinos, blacks, and whites. but the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. iranians are poor, just like the asians. and latinos, as always, are portrait as housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. jesus!!! don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a black tv director, who was the only fresh character for me. this movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from hollywood these days. always with stereotype characters. no realism whatsoever. nothing to identify with. it's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show latinos, koreans, iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.

given this film's incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional. it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. a series of robert altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. a series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until i'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. paul haggis has tackled the subject of race in la, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. let's hope it is the latter, because brokeback mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.

why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyone's guess. and if he did stump up any money for it - all of £50 judging by the looks - he should have been banging on the director's door for a refund the minute the film was released. there are many "alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. even the reliable lance henriksen, saddled with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab, can't save it. as a cure for insomnia, this rates a 10+. as a piece of quality film making - forget it.

spoiler!!!! mind ripper hmmmm.... i had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about giovanni ribisi. i thought giovanni ribisi hadnt done any horrors so i checked into it. i saw "the outpost" (mind ripper) i checked on my tivo for it. there was an air date on sci fi. so i was set. i got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this? a freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling! nothing is scary about this movie at all! if anything its funny! funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make. ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb. it is so stupid. they killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the "monster" is on it. they shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. and-gasp- the killer ending, its still alive! woohhh! scary! woooohhhh! sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours.bottom line: you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time. mind ripper isnt the suggestion. i'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time.overall grade: f- - - - - - - - - - (enternal)

i really loved the millenium series, starred by lance henriksen, which is why i bought the film. obviously at some level it was a mistake. mutant/monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception.the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail (well nevertheless this film would never have been a success, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out this is just a b-class movie. the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all.however, watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious.

the only reason i saw this movie was because it had giovanni ribisi and it was supposed to be "horror". don't be fooled, this movie has to be the worst "horror" film i have seen. it's about these people who go to a secret location which has a "monster" in it. the monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains. some people die, some people don't. in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily. but oh no! the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane! go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.

a 'wes craven presents' movie from 1995, directed by joe clayton and starring lance henriksen. a group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government outpost by injecting him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. lance henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man (pre-unstoppable death machine mutation).deciding to combine two trips in one he brings his family along with him (they're going on vacation afterwards) and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility, thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within. in case you can't tell, this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty (see: major and blatant) details.overall though: watch-able with mild bits of enjoyment. note: the outpost is commonly known under the title 'mind ripper'

i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for. it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time (including mgm's own "libeled lady", which featured two of the same stars) and the success of william powell and myrna loy. three years into their pairing, they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's "libeled lady" and the two "thin man" movies they had done prior to this. "double wedding" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, myrna loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (florence rice), future brother-in-law (john beal), and her own servants (which include sidney toler and mary gordon). when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life, having distracted rice and beal from loy's constant control, loy meets her match. sounds good so far, right? yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. it's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something hollywood did often during its golden age. when loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.fortunately, other than powell, there is free-spirited jessie ralph on board. a salty wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with powell and can see immediately through loy's cool claims that she loathes him. rice and beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless. then, an ex-wife of powell's shows up, which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (it is funny though, that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with; those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.) powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies, "i love you again" and "love crazy", which are sophisticated, witty, and fun. this film attempts to be all three, but ends up a sophisticated bore.

as a physicist, talk about blackholes and cosmology gets my heart racing. however i found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). if you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff, go to the library and check out some books. you will find they explain current scientific cosmologies with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does. also to set the record straight: hawking is not considered the "greatest mind" or the world's "smartest person" as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the imdb. hawking himself has commented that "it is rubbish. it is just media hype. they needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius. at least i'm disabled." to be fair, he is probably a genius but among history's greatest scientists, people like einstein, newton, gauss, and many others easily are even more highly regarded. this is not to disrespect hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has. anyhow, see the movie if you are truly into science. but if not, i think it would be boring for you.

clifton webb is one of my favorites. however, mister scoutmaster is not one of his best. his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. in addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and u.s. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. clifton webb does his best with a poor script. edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. however, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up. since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film. there were and are so many talented child actors; it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it. still, clifton webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.

i just watched this movie on bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. it has the plot of a shannon tweed movie without the nudity. the premise was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. the characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed.for a movie called class warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. this movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a "who done it?"the acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script. lindsey mckeon is very cute and i'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. she's probably the only reason why i sat through the whole movie.

a feminist tract in which if you the viewer believe that: i) wild animals are seldom tamed by singing but instead attack, kill and eat (the line that grizzlies never attack unless provoked was a hoot - unless "provoked" means that it sees flesh); ii) homosexuality is both immoral per se -- and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a society's dissolution and decay iii) few women are bisexual (in this one, virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is far worse than infidelity v) land is there for human beings to use, develop and enjoy vi) it is as incumbent upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son vii) a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii) the idolization of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior, no matter their age, and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships: marriage -- believe me, you are not going to like this film! essentially it's a howard stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a jane fonda sort of woman (think the electric horseman). it's ugly stuff because the values, the ideals, of the screenplay are all so harmful.i share the other objections about the odd things in the writing: a) why would this man lose every girlfriend he has -- because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them? it's a mystery why he just keeps saying "it was personal" when faced with angry and disappointed women. huh? b) there's an enormous inconsistency (i.e., the screenwriter wants to have it both ways) by telling us that the protagonist's mother loved the father with everything she had - and then later we're told that there was only one great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend.c) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. we're never told that the executor has any right to live at the property - merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole heir's title and right to occupy the property. yet somehow the film makes it appear that the executor is the rightful occupant - which is crazy. (try to think of any executor of any will who uses the decedent's property before the will's bequests are fulfilled - it doesn't happen).d) the assumption throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women - it's just absurd. thus, we're told: i) that penelope ann miller's character is dating other men near the end of the film - after having been with the decedent for five years - and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband - is now dating another woman iii) that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore "like to try a woman".iv) that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v) that mary kay place's character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back" she says with an idiotic triumphal flip of the head).this is all just ridiculous.i agree with others about the sound of the dvd (i had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names, phrases).this is a film by someone who really despises traditional heroics by any man, hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child, loathes the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex. the film is out to preach - and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesn't sit well.

subject matter: worthwhile acting: fair (some of it) plot: ridiculous details: sound goes from screechingly high to nearly inaudible; music is not altogether awful (but mostly is); dialog and characterization are laughable; the main character's process of discovery is blindingly obvious to everyone but himself (and the writer, apparently); animal scenes are just plain stupid (singing "moon river" in an off-key, forgotten-lyrics, silly duet to a "herd" of wild boars for hours, as one example). finally, the "wet t-shirt" contest is so over-the-top silly that it has to be seen to be disbelieved. (hint: the 'girl' who wins is not a ... well, i'm not giving that away.)

despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller, this movie was an awkward mess. the lead character's american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result. there was no chemistry between the two actors and i'm still not sure what ann-margaret was doing there.

the sound in this movie is a nightmare. that is the best i can say for this movie. any chance of a good story is lost once this films starts. the premise of the film sounds good. a playboy who comes to terms with the people around him. the plot is predictable and very dull. the wet t-shirt contest may be the worst scene i've ever watched and is almost worth watching in a mystery science type of deal. the sound is at times hard to hear and the main actor seems to not know how to speak clearly. his accent makes him very hard to understand. the only bright sport is the acting of penelope ann miller. her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well. in short, do not waste your time.

mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men. gable and garbo had chemistry in susan lenox but it was a lousy film. here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well. what were they thinking? the modern, fast-talking, wise-crack-snapping montgomery and the long-suffering garbo? it is a tale like camille. young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her.... you get the picture. garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artist's model and completely at home, although bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals. suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own. ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier.the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens. only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as "unfortunately weak women have strong appetites" and "odette, where is thy sting?"only for garbo fans.

on this site i've often lambasted the americans for not knowing how to write comedy, but, while they've never produced anything of the quality of 'fawlty towers', 'blackadder' or 'the fall and rise of reginald perrin', they have also never (to my knowledge) made anything as bad as this: the nadir of british comedy.on my richter scale of comic awfulness, it rates only behind the truly execrable 'are you being served' as the worst comedy show in the english language, with bad acting, annoying characters and humour that i'd grown out of before i left primary school. unfortunately, it was part of a large crop of shows back then, along with 'dad's army', 'it ain't half hot mum' and 'allo, allo' that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catch-phrases to keep audiences "amused".michael crawford proved later on that he's a talented performer, but personally, i'd rather be sentenced to a month of watching 'rhoda' than endure a single episode of this drivel, which makes me ashamed to be british.

i classify this as the worst movie of all time.if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies, this would be it. the plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief.these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie.my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in. i figured that a movie this boring and slow *must* have some cool interesting plot twist, and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized.i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life.

this is possibly the hands down worst movie every made, that actually took itself seriously. and not as a result of the acting, because being an actor, i have to say that rickman and stowe had to be at their best, just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped. being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release, i have to say i have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended, credits rolled, the house lights went on, and no one moved from their seats. about five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around, and i think most of us thought, okay we get it, that was a joke, right?, they are going to show the real movie now. eventually, after the ushers handed out disguises, and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there, we felt that it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. i have seen some pretty bad movies in my day, (i have cinemax for goodness sakes), but i am still bitter that i will never, ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that i lost watching closet land.

closet land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors. nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official. the setting is minimalist. this might be considered soft core s&m porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time, place, and political context. since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. the pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come away disturbed but having learned nothing.what is the point? that torture exists in the world? that abusing prisoners is bad? that dictatorships abuse innocent people? we know that already. closet land has echoes of such works as darkness at noon and ionesco's rhinoceros, but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. this work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. a definite thumbs down.

this movie includes 2 well known actors i have previously enjoyed watching. there actions are great and each action is heart felt. but it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech/drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release.the only good part is the acting abilities, the plot has the same ruse as hitlers influence and i started to hate the protagonist for that. but all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion, so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it.

the best scene of "the people across the lake" is the genuinely creepy, nightly opening-scene featuring a house, a murder & a lake. after that, it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned. a family (mom, dad, sister & younger brother) is fed up with the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia, and decides to go and live near the titular lake. from then on, the film features too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake, with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there. the couple of scenes where they discover the bodies, are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness), but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on (featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in). the truth to the matters (the mystery as to who's doing the killing) is learned too soon, leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale (featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house), like if this made-for-tv thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film. it's not really badly made; the content & story is just not interesting enough. the only highlight in the cast is barry corbin, though his performance/character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious. blond cutie tammy lauren (the daughter) might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too, as she also starred in "wishmaster" (1997), and made-for-tv outings like "i saw what you did" (1988) & "the stepford children" (1987). she hasn't got much to do in this film, though. skippable, but watchable, if anything.

it's been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i've ever seen. i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken. i just finished watching "starship troopers" and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than " poor cow ".

now, i loved "lethal weapon" and "kiss kiss bang bang", but i cannot believe shane black wrote this pile...or that david morse and john c. mcginley are in it. i screened it for a film festival. awful. everyone was laughing. it's preachy and heavy handed...not to mention stupid. also, it's surprising how little l.a. looks like cambodia. the entire idea of time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb. imagine "born on the fourth of july" mixed with "the butterfly effect 2" (i used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by michael bay's 2nd unit director. that bad. the 2 stars are purely based on the production value.

i have one word: focus.well.imdb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. let's discuss the fine points of focus. i don't know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap, like 'you'll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday'--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called focusing the lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting, too. this movie is not only completely out of focus, it's also lit like the corner of someone's basement.don't even get me started on pacing or plot. they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.but who cares about that anyhow? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film's best friends--focus, and lighting.words to the wise.

really, average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.the acting was average (maybe a bit above average), the camera usage was average (actually below average. the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use.this could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.all we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter.) we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her "tell your mom to make some better food" and "everybody says it's your mom." yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. how immature! we're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman, forgot her name, gave her baby up when it was 9 months old.) this really could've been so much more. it could've had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie (that is) alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of america's population (working class) runaways to florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.i don't see why it won an award at sundance (it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award.) also to me, alice's boston/new england accent seemed forced. it didn't seem genuine. (i should know, i was born and raised in boston, but now live in georgia.) 4/10 not really worth your time in my opinion.

this is one of those movies i watched, and wondered, why did i watch it? what did i find so interesting about it? being a truck driver myself, i didn't find it very realistic. no, i've never used a 'lot lizard', nor have i ever seen, nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar rv, either.same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the movie, and well, he still really didn't...), and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut', when the prostitute gets $200.00 (well, $150.00 after his cut, yeah...).i still laugh at the lot lizard comment ivey made (them's lot lizards, they'll screw anything with 20 bucks, and some are men dressed as woman... or something equally as weird), meaning, we're better then them, as we may still be prostitutes, but we get paid better.other then that, it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing (dead end job). at least she had a roof over her head and a job. she turned five tricks on the road... i wonder if the $750.00 she made was worth it? i'd guess not.

the word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations. it aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people. anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment.as can be expected with these screenwriters, yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out. friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either, but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless, redundant and downright silly. contrary to other reviewers i found robert mitchum's performance not very good. this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age. he looks like a tired janitor (it does not go too well with the part), and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest. ken takakura and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young, intelligent, feeling thug respectively.the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy. things are set in motion by the mitchum character's asking the takakura character a favor based on wrong assumptions. the error quickly becomes evident, but the sense of honor demands they must not back off. so they start sneaking around, shooting in all directions, wielding swords and wrecking their friend's arty apartment (although the guy pleads with them stop it, please" all through the corresponding fight). bodies start piling up and the story ends with mitchum's character making his point: if you give him your little finger, i will give you mine. well, it's the least he can do, can't he? so he pulls out a knife, takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity (outside the frame, luckily). it was a moment which probably should have been solemn. it just made me laugh.the use of locations is very good in this movie. i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on lake takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by architect sachio otani (the kyoto protocol was signed there). to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney pollack's more recent documentary sketches of frank o. gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.

kazuo komizu, who hasn't made one decent film, directed this "notorious" shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese release.yes, it does feature scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers ("dirty debutantes") and is incredibly slow.it seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social acts.there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this. on the contrary, that kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning. it's a shame production companies don't realize that.one reviewer here (zombiekilla81) commented that the film's "near obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed it. i disagree. the subject matter is never the issue. the issue is how that subject matter is treated. in entrails of a beautiful woman, it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.personally, i like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. this nikkatsu horror/pink hybrid is woeful.

this adorable dog (called various names during the film) is seemingly loved by the whole town...but he's alone. he is friends with two children (cindy and paul played astonishingly bad) but their father won't let them have a dog. then benji meets tiffany--another adorable dog. they (instantly) fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them frolicking in the grass, drinking from a fountain...in slow motion no less! also benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house i've ever seen. then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept, unfunniest kidnappers i've ever seen and--wouldn't you know it--they hide the brats in the exact house benji lives in! wow was this bad! a huge hit (for some reason) in 1974 which led to many sequels (which i will not see). the film is just terribly acted with "humor" so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the tv in amazement. the film also has a song that is played nonstop during the movie--so much that you want to scream. it was inexplicably nominated for best song at the oscars--it didn't win. yeah--the dogs are adorable and much better than the human actors--but i need more than cute dogs to keep me interested.you might think i'm being a little hard on a kids film but i saw it with my 5 year old nephew. within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching. i kept watching in hope that it would get better--it didn't. really lousy--but very patient kids or dog lovers might like it.note to parents: it's g rated but a dog is viciously kicked a few times. you don't see it--you just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids.

the dog can act...unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux children's film can. a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-hearted father. in what can only be described as dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children --- who may or may not be mentally challenged --- from playing with benji. neither the children nor benji obeys. soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them. it's only then that the old man realizes that benji is good, not bad.tom lester, whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim-witted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers. so does the regrettably over-utilized deborah walley. walley's previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful it's a bikini world. she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good-girl reputation by playing it bad! stay away from benji...he's a dog and this movie is a dog!

this program was shown in an early morning time slot on space, a cable sci-fi station. i am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it; it is incredibly amateurish.the entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall. there is very little continuity between scenes, and no plot. a typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. the dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like photoshop filters. the actors are all adults, but i have literally seen high-school plays with better writing and sets. this program is an embarrassment.perhaps each scene would work as an interstitial; a filler between shows instead of commercials. stringing all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious.

the opening of morte a venezia resembles a duran duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie " in terms of what theo ? " in terms of everything , but especially excitement . i doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one . yeah okay it's a european art house movie so i wasn't expecting charles bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so i did expect some substance if not an actual plot the film revolves around professor gustav von aschenbach visiting venice . gustav visits venice and goes on a gondola , gustav eats in an expensive restaurant , gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want gustav has a flashback bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because gustav notices a pretty boy teenager . so you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen , some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger . great idea for a movie ? i don't think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn i notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it . i can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext i could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy - it was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie

i was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with **spoilers** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box, is given away in the title. perhaps i am just a dense american 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg, but i prefer movies that have at least some words. this movie makes the second half of 2001: a space odyssey down right chatty. this movie is just so slow it isn't even art, it is merely boring. we follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around venice. the end was incomprehensible until i read the end of book. a movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book, it should be able to stand alone. this movie has no way to stand. it doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on.

this...... movie.... is..... horrible!!!!!! you won't believe this hunk of junk is even a movie!!!! critters4 was better then this!!! and critters4 was pretty frigging bad too!!! a bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert, find an old run down bungalow, and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders. pardon my french, but the acting was bad as hell!!! the person who wrote this probably didn't even know what a spider is, because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien-queen-ripoff queen spider! spiders do not live in colonies!!!!!!!!! this "movie" is a piece of crud!!! at the end, the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called!!!! if you see a copy of this movie at a video store, douse it in gasoline and throw a match at it!!!!

my wife and i watched this after dvr'ing it off of encore action this past week. it has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen. predictable dialogue ( my wife and i were guessing the lines before they were spoken), hokey special effects, a screenplay that drifted all over the place. i think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot, not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie, neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their anatomy for the cameras. this movie should be categorized as comedy, not horror as the villains of the movie (spiders) were stop motion animated and not believable in the least. i can't say that i would have done a better job making a film myself, but it was very amateurish and wasn't even a "b" movie, somewhere closer to a "d" movie, or "f" if that is possible. i think even science fiction 3000 would have to pass on this one!

this pointless film was a complete disappointment. none of the characters is likeable in the least, so you watch what befalls each without really caring. what was worst was renting this movie at a gay owned establishment only to find that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men engaged in plenty of scenes of straight sex and not one single scene of gay sex.

i watched this last night on sundance. altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever. this show, despite its "star power" is utterly non-compelling, and its political insights--which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with--are shallow and clunky, and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today, despite the fact it's coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario cuomo. the drama, as such, is not very dramatic, and the comedy is not funny. the only points of interest, really, are seeing how new yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988. sometimes it seems like altman's sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once, the effect of which is one feels depressingly like they're a stranger at a wedding.

altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other, because, he says, people do that in life. well, people also cough, burp, go off on tangents, etc. the point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema. that's one issue.the bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. garry trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of republican elected officials is a 60s-style hippie liberal. i mean the guy still trots out zonker in his strip - a character that is a complete anachronism, yet trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of american youth.don't get me wrong. i am a conservative, but i'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent. it could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant, but it's not. it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals (including the odious, repellent ron reagan, jr.). at times it feels unscripted, and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self-importance and "aren't we oh-so-clever?"-ness.someone said that this show insists it has a cult following. i think its cult status is more wished-for than actual. i'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that is the standard, then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree. if tanner didn't have the names altman and trudeau attached, it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s. instead, it's presented as hard-hitting, incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game. the reality, however, is about as far from that as possible. pat paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than tanner ever was, and he's been dead for a decade.

this video has audio that is meant for someone to hear during their sleep. and the same can be said for the video.morgan and his wife pretending to rough it at minimum wage jobs? with a camera rolling? and his little wifey-poo complaining? give me a break. they are both rich. they are sitting in their fake $350/month apartment filming this with their $1,000/month each video crew of 12.i used to respect morgan, but now his "30 days" experience is nothing more than trying to fool any volunteer viewers who are willing to be fooled.c'mon morgan, you are being filmed doing a $6.00 an hour job and you are being paid by naive employers who don't see those big cameras filming the whole thing?? and we aren't to think they aren't paying you under the table?

i have only seen the minimum wage episode yet i have no intention of watching the others, how can that be? morgan starts theatrically complaining about his awful situation living on minimum wage right at the beginning of the episode and the complaining never stops. ever. luckily for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as morgan (if not even more annoying).and then to top it all, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2,50 and after that go to a restaurant to eat out all the while they naturally *drumroll* complain about being poor.i don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this. no one should be forced to watch this crap.

i saw the episode about living on minimum wage. it went as far as an oprah winfrey's appearance for the said episode. it's bad enough people struggle making ends meet week to week. then having this hypocrite exploiting the problem. i didn't appreciate the constant complaining from him or his significant other, throughout. queston is how any people have the power to pay their medical bills from the er? sure he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance(from his own pocket) after-wards from his "harrowing" experience. how many poor people have that type of privilege after 30 days to pay off their bills. instead they are starving and "robbing peter to pay paul". complaining throughout the episode isn't a humbling thing for him. the movie and restaurant scene is appalling. another privilege he has that poor people don't.

an "independant" film that, from the back of the box, promises twists, adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget. this film also fools us into watching it by flaunting rachel lee cook with a starring role. after the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is going to give you nothing. the story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. all three "disturbed" characters have only small grains of back story to force us to care. just as you reach the end, everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up, you are left with no idea, and more importantly, no interest in "why". the director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. the entire piece looks like a college "art" film crafted by a freshman film student trying to hide a lack of true talent.

pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses. rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance, but i would recommend this film only to die-hard fans of the actress.

i usually love these movies. give me a good old b movie any day but this one was simply awful. the acting(?) was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely. i thought i saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with attack of the killer tomatoes! in all honesty - it was the acting that did this film in for me.i found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male/female were extremely dull. this movie had absolutely nothing going for it. i may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene? did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out? i think they were probably right! oh where is price and the tingler when you need them?

this is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad. such a movie that you watch just to see it's shitty craftsmanship. supposedly a horror, i cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug, especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it.even with no budget, a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it, as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it. if i had nothing to make fun of while it was playing, i would have stopped it after 10 minutes, and put on some quality show like spunge bob square pants (har har har).i strongly recommend that brett piper get with quintin terrantino and really pump out some feces.:)

as you can tell from the other comments, this movie is just about the worst film ever made. let me see how many different words i can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, laughable, lousy, stupid, horrible.....i could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point.i would have given this a 0, if possible--bad acting, bad directing, bad production, bad plot.this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965. very low budget, boring plot, horrible acting, really bad special effects, etc...i rarely ever see a sci-fi film i absolutely think is this bad. i mean this is pure garbage. it has nothing going for it either. as far as a "b-movie" this is the very bottom of the lot.i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes. junk like this gives good low-budget "b" movies a bad name. this makes ed wood movies look good.the thing about watching direct-to-video movies is, just when you think you've seen the worst, you see something even worse!dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out.avoid this waste at all costs! oh the humanity!

i watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny. but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art. this is funny at times, but annoying for the most part. and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted. one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit. apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid. very impressive. but this is just one example. and for what its worth, the music sucks, the acting sucks, the two cute girls are annoying, the obnoxious guy is annoying, the so-called handsome lead man is a geek, and the black girl who fall for him is a fool. her father is the worst actor i have ever seen. i am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience.

this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie--gee maybe that's why it is a straight-to-video wanna-be movie!i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions i have ever made). what a waste. i usually like b movies, some of them are actually quite good--but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny.the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film! these so-called movie makers have absolutely no talent!stupid plot, horrible acting (especially the drag queens--what sicko would actually find that sexy?!), lame writing (if there even was a script--seems like the kinda bull**** someone just made up on the spot)what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well-done at all.how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards? i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally, and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results.anyway, avoid this stink bomb at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

it's tempting to view this film as a daring avant-garde experiment. i like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely, utterly, entirely unfunny.the answer, to judge by "from venus", is a resounding 'yes'. this may not be the worst film i've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others. this horrible flick hovers just on the borderline: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not quite so bad that my internal censors have obliterated it from my consciousness.it's difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this, or why they went ahead and released it once they'd made it. i doubt anyone involved with it earned very much, but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the prints and have them burned.this is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it. it's not even enjoyably bad. it's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens. i gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back, which is not something i've ever done before.don't even think about renting (much less buying!) this horrible non-movie!

words cannot express how poor this film is.there is no plot, the acting is appalling, basically the whole film is a joke.with a running time of 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes too long.it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show, but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in.avoid this one, go rent a good movie instead!

this movie was so stupid i couldn't believe what i was seeing as i was watching it, it was like a huge train wreck -- i couldn't look away because it was just so horribly awful! i can honestly say i've never seen anything this bad in my whole entire life. it was so cheesy and the acting was just so deplorable that i just kept thinking "this just has to be some kind of a joke, right? nobody would actually make a movie this crappy on purpose, right?" i really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't actually expect people to watch this with a straight face, and i really hope the people who were in this movie were doing terrible acting on purpose and don't actually believe that they are good actors?! the drag queens are pretty funny to watch, though, and so are the cheesy special effects straight out of a bad 80's sci-fi movie.only watch this if you've already seen every other movie in existence first and there is nothing left to watch at all! i would give this a "0" if it were possible.

to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie! actually, i'm more embarrassed that i sat through the whole thing. it looks like an old 80's sci-fi movie complete with super-fake looking "special effects", queer imagery, and very cheesy dialogue. maybe that's the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to do movies in 80's fashion like it will come back in style. who knows...if you think the promised eye-candy will save the film, you're in for a disappointment--the so-called "babes" are manish and downright ugly. they can't act at all, i don't understand why they couldn't at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent! but i guess when you're making a film this stupid, you don't get very good choices, hot chicks aren't just lining up to do this kind of pitiful crap!

if you want to see how to ruin a film, study this one very closely. in fact, it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone. especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes. realism escapes this movie on every level. the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever. with a formula like that, it just had to be doomed.i rented this once, and i swear i got stupider watching it. if you are a humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie, and burn it-unwatched- as a favor to the world. it has no discernible plot, bad acting, and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off. i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape! seriously. the paint would be better. i wish i could give this negative 10 stars.

36/100. this is not to be confused with the decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie. this one is so bad, it actually does have some entertainment value on that level. there are numerous unintended (i think) laugh out loud scenes. i wasn't expecting much from the film, and it was actually worse than i had imagined it would be.it's a cliché ridden and predictable direct to video mess. fortunately, it doesn't take itself too seriously. the acting, as expected, is not quite oscar caliber. the special effects are poor, worse than i would have thought they would be. poorly edited and the score is intrusive.

i picked this up because, having spent time in the albany region of new york, i knew a couple of people in the movie and i happened upon it by chance. the attempts at comedy are lame, the compulsory girl-on-girl scene is sickening, the plot is nonexistent, the acting is among the worst i've ever seen, and don't even get me started on special effects. i realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company, but if you're going to do a sci-fi horror flick with giant bugs, don't make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. people want to see giant bugs. that's half the fun right there. and if you're going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable, at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue-in-cheek allusion to that fact ("you idiots! these aren't them! you've captured their stunt doubles!"). be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you'll never be able to get back.

in a way, you have to respect arachnia. it's clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesn't feature cgi. however, on the other hand; you can't respect the film too much because it's a load of rubbish. the acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen one giant spider being blown up; you've seen them all, so it gets boring rather quickly. the plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. they go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. coincidently around the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. all the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you. you've got to feel for director brett piper as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film; but that doesn't make arachnia worth a damn, and overall there are better giant bug films than this, and therefore arachnia doesn't get the seal of approval from me.

angels and demons: 3 out of 10: clearly something bad has happened to ron howard. i don't know what exactly, but something has gone very wrong.howard has always been a decent workman director. while he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both cinderella man and apollo 13 were excellent films, parenthood was pretty good and even angels and demons prequel/sequel the da vinci code was a fun romp. in addition none of his films have been downright awful. (note i have seen neither how the grinch stole christmas nor his newest film heidi montag says no to plastic.) whats more howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven oscar bait (a beautiful mind), star driven costume drama (far and away), star driven revenge fantasy (ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (night shift, splash).angels and demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film. scenes are too dark, camera angles are all wrong, the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus. this makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled.dan brown gets picked on a lot but i found the da vinci code a fun readable romp (so sue me). the movie version of the da vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting.angels and demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of vatican city and since howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a cgi back lot. the entire film is as if rick steves did a vatican city special and instead of actually visiting the holy city and pointing his camera, rick had to use lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased.while the da vinci code had what i still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me), demons and angels story consists of a plot by the illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the vatican. their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly. oops my bad; apparently the vatican doesn't need any help on that one.anyway their plan is to infiltrate europe's large hadron collider, kill the head priest, and steal three vials of anti-matter. this begs more than a few questions. can the hadron collider create anti-matter? can you capture the anti-matter once created? why is the eu collecting it? (perhaps they fear a godzilla attack?). why is the head of anti-matter gathering a vatican priest? now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding; unfortunately the illuminati haven't quite grasped that pinky and the brain level of sophistication just yet. instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. the top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the illuminati are killing them one by one seven style. they being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some latin themed riddler. oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time rick steves will have to go straight to venice next year to see decent frescoes. if only there was some latin themed batman to save the day? okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. a true character study (okay you know where this is going). tom hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest israeli actress ayelet zurer has zero chemistry with either hanks or the screen. ewan macgregor plays the pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his lucky charms.on the plus side stellan skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of vatican security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its vatican critics in at least one area.

i had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, i had no expectations.'angels and demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. there was very little character development and i never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, i was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the illuminati are who they are.the film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.the climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.the actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mostly because i found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors, and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and i had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.the most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, i found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess, that i found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.

this critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch angels and demons the movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because "angels and demons is worth it." two of the four had read the book. of those that didn't, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. this was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent angels and demons.the movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. and apparently someone knows about it or something. notice how very confused i am.. i don't get what happened: they were just making the antimatter. vittoria finds her own father dead... what? the illuminati symbol sent to langdon is a printout, not a burn on someone's chest. they take out the x-33 scene. they take out maxmillian kohler. they, pretty much, take out cern and the symbology connected to it. they take out the hassasin and replace him with some religious, british dude. they take out the illuminati diamond. they take out vittoria's near-rape scene. they take out langond's fight with the hassasin (now british dude on crack). they take out the press dude following them around. they take out the death of the fourth cardinal. they take out the fact that the camerlengo becomes pope. they take out the camerlengo's grand scheme. they take out langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. they take out the fact that vittoria's father was a scientific priest. they take out langdon's fun and most unfortunately, they take out vittoria's sexual appeal.other than the movie completely losing focus of the details, the movie is acted horribly. one must admit, though, there were some good things. for example, the sistine chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. the explosion scene was mind-blowing. other than that, screw this movie for ruining the book for the people who didn't read it.

an extremely fast paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich book. its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was tom hanks' mild mannered portrayal or robert langdon laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor irish/italian accent from carmalengo played by ewan mcgregor, made for the worst book to film ever.as a huge fan of a&d the book, i had high hopes for a more lavish, true to book detailed movie, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.all the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.in short - vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to audrey tatou and there were some very nice alfa romeos.i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if ron howard must insist on making another book to film, i would be happy saving my £6.40 for a kfc zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!

maybe the subject was good, but put down to a script it fails in pace. maybe the author was trying to obtain something slow-paced like alien, but instead of being haunting, this movie turned out just boring. technically good, anyway, a pity for the lack of tension.

i just got done watching this movie and i have to say, it was a good film, i loved some of the good guy's and i loved the killer robot but the movie had some hole's in it.the name's of the people in it was kind of..stupid..i think people should of sued the maker's of this movie for how lame it was at the end..the first half hour was good but then it just dragged on and on then i was happy..it was over...but still loved the the killer robot and some of the movie's good guy's in it.i think it was the best two buck's i have ever spent because i do like stupid b-movie's like this one and come on..it is a b-movie everyone.

in a nutshell, skip this movie, it's that bad. in short, this movie is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed. because they make bad things, they aren't popular so to speak. a new female ceo comes in to clear things up, and make sure the reputation of the company will be improved. she does this by leaking company confidential information to the press... do you believe this? furthermore she starts to fire people she has never seen. incredible uh? a pacifistic group tries to destroy the company's mainframe, because there are the blueprint located of those secret weapons. this mainframe is located in the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault. of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot which is the ultimate killer machine, which resembles like an 'alien' from the alien movies. the mad scientist likes the female ceo.the mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, and so protects his job, rise in chain of command, and make the movie interesting. the pacifists team up with the ceo and another person of the board of directors to escape from the robot. further down the line they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe, whilst avoiding the robot. they also discover that the factory was developing a part man, part machine soldier. they can erase a persons memory and replace it by a veteran soldier's one. one of the pacifists is transformed in such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot. i guess the mad scientist also wrote the script of this movie. this super soldier looks and acts much the same as robocop, though not as funny.it boils down to this. people are running, being chased by a killer robot, are hurt by it, but they do not seem to troubled by that, besides limping a bit, and of course the female ceo is the leading character of this movie, and cannot be killed, i.e. survives every attack, explosion, you name it. i won't bother you by the chase, let's skip to the end. they have lots of weapons, yes the pacifist too and they know how to use them. when they're at the roof of the building they empty all there weapons upon the killer robot. they step into an elevator which is used to clean outside windows. and then the female ceo knows some magic as well, at the roof she was complaining about being out of bullets, and like magic the gun is reloaded. this way she can shoot the cables and let the elevator plummet 70 stories or so, and let it stop right above ground surface by pulling the brake. and to top it all off, the police is waiting there for them. the robot jumps after them, and kills the cops. hilarious no? the robot chases them down the vault where the mainframe is, and when finally the robot is so close to her, that he can touch/kill her, it stops. because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed. a better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist. although he is the one who made this movie watchable. at this moment i was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all of, so the movie would end.i cannot believe that this movie rates this high, and this is why i wrote this comment. avoid this movie like the plague. it's a monster, and i'm not talking about the death machine.

this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time, never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island "how convenient!!!!", the acting is beyond poor from the outset, its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5, a complete waste of time, and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work!!! i've never seen him act "i've seen him in lots of films... but i've never seen him act. here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors, apparently petrol lighters still work even when they've been soaked in sea water!!! also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms (i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students)there are plenty more errors but i'm ranting now, besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs

by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. i watch practically every movie that is on at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc). "three" aka "survivor island" keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably. if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie. i must have screamed at a minimum 900 times from the idiotic twists. if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down.in my personal opinion, i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals.

european films may be slower-paced and less plot driven than american films, but this takes it way too far. it also show a whole bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things. it's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad.what's the message here? that people in france are pensive and gaze morosely a lot? that they like to watch other people having sex? they they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck? do not wear a watch when seeing this film, as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time.this is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl, though actually he seems troubled before then. he is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally quite slow, behaving very much like a learning-disabled six-year old child. he stares blankly a lot, walks with arms rigid like a little kid, speaks in meek, simpering, tones, behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care, even when it is supposed to be police business). he's not a troubled cop, more of an outpatient. picture andy kaufman's latka character on taxi, but without the humor. he is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult. that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing -- unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing. the plot is clearly secondary. do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered. this not that important, though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting. the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either. that leaves the long lingering close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces etc. the ending struck me as especially ridiculous -- totally unsupported by the events leading up to it -- unless you think, "what's the worst way this film could end?"there is lots of sex and nudity, which is supposed to mean something. you want vaginas? you'll see vaginas. not to worry, it's art. it has deep meaning, what i am not sure. and the protagonist, despite his innocent weirdness, seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish.finally, the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background -- very hard to read many of them. on the other hand, there isn't much dialogue, so this isn't a big problem. there is also very little sound -- not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear -- in the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. the old woody allen would have had a field day parodying this work.that this is an award-winning film is sad. i would hate to see the losing films.enjoy.

the director infuses this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film. every single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be. you could easily cut out 1.5 hours of this agonizingly long 2.5 hour film without eliminating: one word of dialogue, one image, one event, or bit of movement.this was one of the most gratuitous wastes of film i have ever seen. other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. l'humanite is pseudo-intellectual trash designed to be anti-hollywood so that the cannes judges could assert their independence from the oscars.the imdb reviewer states: "unlike hollywood movies - which usually force the audience into overdrive - this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's tiniest and most mundane features in great detail." you would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters. this isn't real life unless you are heavily medicated.finally, i felt that schotté's portrayal was a sad rip-off of peter sellers' masterful "chauncy gardner." he uses the same facial expressions and postures. he even gardens! in many respects there are parallels between these two movies. the main difference being that "being there" moves along and doesn't rely on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life.

this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at carnegie mellon university (cmu) at a 10 pm show. there was a scheduled 1 am show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3:30 am. the opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. it is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. it is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds, as to say, "what's the message?"). the story resembles dostoyevsky's novel "the karamazov brothers", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. in one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from english system to metric system to "they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour". what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it. this was no film kitchen 8-mm experiment. it was carefully planned, structured, acted, montaged. yet, i got so little out of it. some comments indictated on the excruciating detail, such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a door just opened. okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? some corageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. the rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. there never was. and maybe that's what the film is about. all the movies at the theater are action-packed. this one wants to be different. there is nothing happening.

the premise of the movie had much going for it, however, despite the novelty of models selling off someone else's furniture to live the high life, this movie has nothing going for it. the characters are cardboard. the dialog is so painfully scripted, it's hard to sit through, and if there were any jokes in the movie, i missed them. marilyn monroe's walking into walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable & not funny. grable's stupidity is also too ham-fisted to be believed. bacall's gold-digging is so forced, it's annoying to listen to. why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me.

playmania is extremely boring. this is the basis of the show. mel or shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old could answer at an extremely slow pace. this show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period. people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy, but they're hotness completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoying.during the show they mention that we need more players a million times. the top 5 surveys that they do probably takes about 20 minutes out of the show. this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. one of the reasons they probably don't have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money. the most money i've ever seen them hand out was $210. i wouldn't be surprised if this "game show" is canceled by the end of 2006.

it really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie. the beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. the partisan "af" was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the croat ustashi af deserted, together with their observers, in breguet 19 and potez 33, respectively. the aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but didn't last very long. one crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot being killed later while flying a spitfire vc. the real partisan squadrons were established when raf detached two of its (yugoslav) squadrons of spitfire vc and, hurricane iic , respectively, manned by ex yugoslav royal airforce pilots, and allotted them to tito's forces on the island of vis. even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. so the film was one giant cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, otherwise not at all bad, director. by some quirk of fate i was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie, when dozens of german aircraft were destroyed (yugoslav 522 trainers, used also in the flying sequences) on the mostar military airport. the pyrotechnics were impressive, and the scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better. otherwise, the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience.

throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the "partisans"  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading german forces. hajrudin krvavac, who's generally only known in eastern europe, directed quite a few of these "partisan" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the europe and the united states. "battle of the eagles" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the partisan air force.marshal tito decrees that a partisan air force must be formed to combat the german luftwaffe in the skies over yugoslavia. a group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable  whatever it is, it sure isn't convincing, but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work.the film opens strongly with a well-shot german air raid on defenseless partisans. the nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. then the action starts, and this title quickly becomes yet another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure. all of the characters are familiar clichés: major dragan (played by a well-meaning bekim fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. he blasts away at strafing planes with a machine-gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous klauberg (radko polic), a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome. the rest of the partisans are familiar: ljubisa samardzic ("the battle of neretva") is a zare, a hotshot playboy; bata zivojinovic ("hell river") is voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him; and rados bajic ("the day that shook the world") is dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks, eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot. the characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan, and krvavac doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes. the cast does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional script, every player is engaging and fun to watch. bajic, in particular, has some great moments  when he's going to take his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed. the plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the germans, and subsequent retaliatory acts.krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects. unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and false-looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable. some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just plain pathetic. sometimes smoke puffs from the "machine-guns" are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane. worse, the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage. although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective, they're surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism. all of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by bojan adamic."battle of the eagles" also suffers from a very poorly edited english-language release. to begin with, 28 minutes of footage is missing  cutting the film from 130 minutes to a mere 102. the missing segments were carelessly excised, and the cutting looks very sloppy. music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. in the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some badly-needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. then, there's the dubbing all of the scenes revolving around the partisans are dubbed in english (rather poorly, however), yet several lengthy scenes remain in german, without the benefit of subtitles. the film might have made much more sense had the german-language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the partisans.on the plus side, krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well. there is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a soundstage. in particular, the german luftwaffe bases are expansive, complete with dozens of messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets. the scenery is fresh and green, and krvavac isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek. a german ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out, as does a sequence where zare and dalibor escape from an enemy base.as it exists on home video, "battle of the eagles" is just another of many stories about the yugoslav partisan movement. there is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable. try to avoid this one unless you can find a full-length copy.

in this film gary oldman plays a defense attorney, who was formerly a prosecutor. he is a bit tormented, but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of figurative or literal monster. funny thing is, he doesn't quite pull it off. i guess you can't quite get to normal from there. kevin bacon was sufficiently creepy. the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares. and the odd sex scene with oldman and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie, although the rest of the time miss young did just fine. this film suffers from oddness trying to cover up the predictability. and failing. don't bother.

the breadth & height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me. about a week ago i posted a commentary on the 1926 silent epic maciste in hell referring to it as "staggering". then i encountered the pollonia bros. blood red planet. wow ...it's all about the scale of the thinking behind it. the pollonia bros. and colleague john mcbride were thinking so big that the musings of arthur c. clark & stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odessey is lucky it was released thirty-two years before this sweetheart. as a matter of fact, kubrick had it easy with modelers, a budget, actual actors and major studio backing for his little "star trek" ripoff, and all that arthur c. clarke had to do was write the damn thing. what's so hard about muscling around a typewriter? the pollonia brothers on the other hand had to think radical, outside of the box, and quickly. they recruited a half dozen of their friends & colleagues -- including a hot lookin' chick -- bought a bunch of colored lightbulbs, raided old office supply dumps for every keyboard, monitor and hands-free phone headset they could find, got everybody identical black turtlenecks, made off with every cupcake tin in the county, learned enough 3d modeling & texture skinning to animate a couple of space ship fly-bys, spent a couple hours drumming up a script, executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since that horrible little monster jabba the hut carried around with him was fried by r2d2, spent literally days working with a vhs camera and an amiga to shoot & edit their film, and came up winners. this is the best d.i.y. direct to home video fan movie space epic i've ever seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent & resources at the disposal of the filmmakers dwarfs even logans run or battlestar: galactica (the original series) as being a chilling look at our future, right down to a newscaster wearing a mis-matched, ill-fitting 2nd hand suit. as a species, we are doomed.seriously for a minute, though, it is a vast improvement upon such later epics as the dinosaur chronicals or preyalien: alien predators, which is funny since it was made before either of those masterpieces. somewhere along the lines the pollonia's started taking it easy on themselves: this film is executed with a certain conviction that gets you to believe that you really can breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker squirt bottles. and the scene where the alien beast consumes a miniaturized crew member made me immediately think of where i'd seen that before: godzilla vs. the sea monster, where the giant rampaging monster crab skewers two canoers and eats them on camera. that made me cry when i was a kid.this made me cry as an adult because here i am wasting my time trying to be some sort of critic or writer or writer/critic and these guys get to have all the fun, actually making a real feature length sci-fi epic with lots of cool colored lights, a hot chick and a talking slide projector named kal. one of the flight crew even gets to wear his black space baseball cap backwards & glower with his goatee like that clown from metallica. is this supposed to be a joke? no. it is an epic statement about humanity, from humanity and for humanity that deserves to be seen by anybody who has the capability to not take any of it too seriously. look for it on a 2 disc box set called galaxy of terror in your favorite discount retailer's cutout dvd bins, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "yeah, they have a couple box sets of our movies for sale at best buy." 4/10: anyone lacking in a sense of humor might want to try silent running or maybe tron. but someday an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this movie and decide that we actually are not to be messed with. good work, guys!!

this film is a hodge-podge of various idiotic cliches. for instance, boy-meets-spoilt-rich-girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college (an over-used backdrop in recent indian commercial films). a male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. the climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films). as with many other recent commercial hindi films, the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else.

"stealing time" actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled "rennie's landing". which explains how director marc fusco was able to afford this cast of now established television/movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. about ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago. its recent distribution by franchise pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs. although not a great addition to anyone's resume, young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind.peter facinelli, ethan embry, scott foley and charlotte ayanna play college friends who do an early "big chill" reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams. unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. yes alec (facinelli) dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery, which are then "cheaply and lamely" staged to completely inappropriate music. it is the least suspenseful bank job since w.c. fields was the guard in "the bank dick". if anyone can point to any moment in "stealing time" where something "actually" happens i would like to know about it, because as far as i can tell, not a thing happens in the whole film. perhaps fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it is too late. like "st. elmo's fire" the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time.i felt fusco was going for a kind of howard hawks young professionals in action "only angels have wings" motif. then again, i'm sure i was reading much too much into the film. after all, things actually happen howard hawks films.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

this movie is a waste of time. though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the movie is sub-par, and has a cliché point. "you never know what's going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." that sentence saves you from wasting hours of your life on this movie. people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before finding that the entire movie was a dream sequence. if the most important part of the movie isn't even going to happen, at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivating. there's a reason this project didn't make a theatrical release, and though indy films can turn out very good, this one does not even come close.

i found this film to be a bit too depressing. i don't mind dramas, but this was a bit too much for me. luckily, there does seem to be somewhat a decent outcome. i suppose it was well done. i'd watch it again, but it's nothing to rave about.

as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing, this is *not*: a film. (cue dramatic music) it's just a so-bad-it's good, totally surreal, jackie chan stunt-for-all. the women fighters are totally kick-butt and jackie is definitely put in his place. this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon -- surrounded by munchies, ready to roar with laughter, cheer on the good guys, boo the bad guys, and continually yell, "what?" when something totally bizarre happens. great fun!!

yet another lo wei production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan, to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action, and plain old-school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue.in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend chin chin from the killer bees, a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home, cao lei (jackie chan) pretends to be a heartless cad, driving her away, and thus saving her from danger.during the attack, cao's relatives are all killed, but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang, whose leader, a scar-faced woman, seems to have the hots for him. cao then goes in search of chin chin, whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend chu chuk.during his quest to find his true love, cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'bloody rain' clan. eventually, after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan (a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry), and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced killer bee (who shows her love by burning his face!), cao ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character: his friend, chu chuk, is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'bloody rain' clan, who has plans to marry chin chin himself.cue the drawn out climactic battle, with cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf.even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through, with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film (with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand!), or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero, but, for most, this film will have very limited appeal.

early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know. this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through hong kong taiwan and mainland china. its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult jackie chan to super stardom. its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie. i was watching it, in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film. honestly i don't think the film is really worth bothering with (there are too many other better variations) except if you're interested in seeing where jackie chan started.

director lo wei was known to read the racing papers and take naps on the set - tells us something about his "approach to film-making, huh? the reviews i've read fall into two categories: 1) this is a film so bad it is funny, or 2) this is a film so bad it is boring.so let's get to the point we all agree on - this film is really bad.i vote for category 2). the story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing. yet lo wei was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it, whether we want to or not.maybe lo wei was upset the day (or two) this film was made - he just wanted to make everybody suffer, cast, crew and audiences alike.spare yourself the agony.

i watched part of the first part of this movie, and tiny little bits of other parts. maybe i'm mistaken, but i don't think this movie is really worth watching. the odd characters and happenings does catch your attention and is rather interesting, but there are bad things in it as well, and some gross things. the magic and mythical side of it turned me off, and for most christians this movie would not be very suitable or worthwhile to watch.

this tatty am dram adaptation scrambles soulessly through the plot of dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior locations with drawings. it's not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when there's neither the time nor money to do it justice. michael hordern's scrooge is far too gentle at the outset, making his transformation lack power, and this isn't helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions. the other actors range from acceptable (clive merrison, paul copley), to non-committal (bernard lee) to seeming like they're about to forget their lines (john le mesurier). it doesn't even score points for effort, to be honest.

when i think bollywood. i think of lite feel good musical dance numbers, with gorgeous outfits on the men and women. and catchy tunes. horror, thrillers, mystery and suspense, don't come to mind though. and this, to my western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. i think it would have been a better movie, shorter even, if the writer and the director had made a definite choice. either gone for outright thriller-horror, comedy-mystery, supernatural-suspense or musical-romance, instead of an awkward mixture of them all. i'll have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen "i know what you did last summer" and tried to give it a bollywood twist. my first film was bride & prejudice. which i thought was acted well. this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese fest.the acting was over the top, at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers, but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying, screaming or fear, it felt out of place. the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera. more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified, we could only snicker a the absurdity. i watch a lot of foreign films, and even though i don't know hindi, i have to say they did a poor job subtitling the film. sometimes it was difficult to read the white lettering against the bright background. the villain was particularly amusing, at least to me, because he came with his own mood music. the supposed surprising twist, actually felt like a cop out.the lead couples were handsome/pretty enough, and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee. i'd suggest it to someone as a musical- comedy, but i'd tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie, because it wasn't worth the effort of reading. if you're determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick, then check out the superior romantic drama 'namasteay, london'. but i was not scared..unless that's really what they think is horrifying in india. 1 out of 10 for what it's being touted as. 6 out of 10 for it's unintentional quickness & ability to illicit lots of laughs, and it's musical/dance numbers. enjoy :)

ramsay  the kings of comedy (or was it horror, whatever) wake after years of hibernation. and yes, i did get scared. no not because of the horror element (of course i am not that squeamish) but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmal-chaap theatre (where else do such movies run).so check the plot. a man is repeatedly stabbed, choked to death, stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool. but he still returns to take revenge. now was the film a thriller or a horror? that itself is the suspense for you to discover. and the end turns out to be another mask mystery. remember those trademark ramsay undercover agents  men wearing some stupid horror masks. only here the mask is of a human. i suppose, no more detailing is required to skip this flick.amarr upadhyay tends to get over-dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between cinema and tv soaps. a cheaply and skimpily dressed aditi gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like .. (uh! you know what).the background score is a straight lift from alfred hitchcock's psycho. not a single department of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth commenting. novelty lacks both in story and execution.dhund certainly fogs your senses.

having been a godzilla fan for many years, gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of toho's #1 kaiju star. attack of the monsters was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience.last weekend, i attended the annual godzilla fest, known as g-fest, where carl craig, one of the stars of gamera vs. viras, made an appearance. of course, they featured this movie. it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. of course, you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. in one scene, for example, the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. when they realize they"ve been duped, one of them says, "that's funny...i think those kids lied to us." not even plan nine from outer space can boast that kind of dialog.this may not be godzilla or even gamera 3, but this one is a decent enough time waster, if you watch it in the right frame of mind.however, if you want top quality kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released gamera 3.rating: **1/2 out of *****

chayanne is beautiful enough, vanessa is beautiful enough, i liked the storyline. but i went in with the expectation to see lots of energetic hot salsa dancing, i was disappointed. there needed to be more dancing, especially salsa.

the only good part of this movie was the ending. you know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. no no that may be a little harsh - the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended. as long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well. as for chayanne's debut - not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth. as for going to see the movie wait for the rental or tv. do not make the same mistake i did and pay 8.50

anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film. it's interesting they titled it "the hole"! the production values are good for a short film. the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on. i speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat. many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content.my honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. maybe ishimoto's next film will deliver.

this short film doesn't get there. cliche' and not very funny attempt at dark humor. humor isn't funny enough to get you interested and the protagonist isn't likeable so you really don't care about what happens anyway. producer spent some money on this flop and it shows in the production value which is the only saving grace.

really for a short film that looks high budget this is just a candy coated piece of cr*p. it tries so hard to be hollywood. but even hollywood stories have an okay story (sometimes). money wasted on an effort to be hollywood. waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time. for the short film buff, look elsewhere...

well, i like to watch bad horror b-movies, cause i think it's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. (i always compare this movies to - for example - some spielberg's works and again-and-again don't understand the huge difference in what i see.) i like ed wood's movies cause it's so inept it's very funny. but people!!! "the chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable. there's no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. it's extremely inept amateurish film. it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen (and i had seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). i warned you !!! 1/10

"the chilling" directed by deland nuse and jack a.sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen.why linda blair("the exorcist","witchery")appeared in this stinker is beyond me.the plot is really dumb:the frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies.the characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid,the zombies look horrible and there is no gore.avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague.my rating:1 out of 10.

woof! pretty boring, and they might as well have shot it in black and white, it was so colorless.the movie starts with rolling text explaining cryogenics, and asking whether god or satan is behind it. there are some protests outside a cryogenics lab. some people rob a bank, and many of the robbers and guards get shot. the father of one of the robbers (i think) arranges to have his son frozen. there's a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relate.there's a power outage, and the cannisters containing the frozen people get struck by lightning, and they emerge as zombies. they're all wearing silver mylar-like suits, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (no idea why they look so bad - being frozen evidently didn't preserve their looks), and they have silver eyes. they go around killing people, sometimes lurching like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people.linda blair keeps showing up every once in a while, to what purpose i'm not really sure. i think her character works at the cryogenics lab, but she's not very important to the plot, and her role is very small.the movie ends with some freeze frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters next, which are pretty silly.

as to be expected, there's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always-popular premise of zombies and starring the 80's b-movie queen linda blair, namely: it sucks! "the chilling" is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background, whereas it should have just been a light-headed and gore-packed horror flick about frozen zombies. it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens. there's a lot of drivel about cryogenics, which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. so naturally, in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen. needless to say this is extremely boring, until two dim-witted night watchmen decide, during an electric power failure, that it's a good idea to put the metal-constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm. the coolers are struck by lightening, obviously, and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage. "the chilling" is a boring and surprisingly (for a late 80's effort, at least) gore-free horror film that doesn't even use up a quarter of its potential. all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and i can't think of any reason why the zombie-attacks had to be so bloodless. even in spite of the low budget available, they could have done better. the set pieces, make-up effects and costumes are pitiable. the research lab, for example, looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldn't look less menacing with their green faces and foil-wrapped outfits. how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low-budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery. she's attracted to lousy b-movies like bees are to honey.

i'm all about the walking dead, but my mind is still unsure of the walking, frozen dead. sadly, the chilling didn't help me make up my mind. this is really slow with nothing happening for the first 45 minutes, making me hit the "film enhancement" button several times. by the time the well designed zombies show up, it is too late and the director (two are rumored to have filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. haggerty, blair and donahue all look tired/embarrassed/recovering in some fashion. i will give the film credit as it predates the t2 ending with villains being frozen by liquid nitrogen. the shriek show dvd offers an extended promo reel from back in the day that runs 8 minutes long and i would actually recommend that over watching the flick in its entirety.

before i speak my piece, i would like to make a few things clear: 1)i am a chick who's not into chick flicks ("kate&leopold" and "someone like you" are extreme exceptions- hugh jackman's ass). 2)i only picked this one up because i am a fichtner fangirl who looked forward to see him in a bathtub. 3)i am not a demi fan, though i think her performances in "immortal" and "a few good men" were sublime and have earned places in my vid library- also i think she's a little crazy (no way is she not still sleeping w/brucie).if this is a character study of an unfulfilled woman living dual lives of independence and happiness, then i'd say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. marty: literary agent. makes 6-figure salary. lives in an upscale manhattan penthouse. easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested nocturnal escapism. or perhaps stepping through an interdiemsional portal? she has the career, the looks, a cool car, a great pad, now where are the man and kids? in steps our boy aaron- some real escapism. what are architects? they're artists who can do math, dreamers that make real money. aaron gives marty the dream of security and fills a void where she, obviously has no self confidence.on the other side of the coin, there's marie, still living out her schoolgirl fantasies while she muddles through motherhood. her children are her career and life. but what about marie, does she only exist through her children? in waltzes william, a parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with: herself.a supposed journey of self-discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some resentment to marty/marie's own mother. this gets a 3/10. all i could say is thank god for the bpl multimedia division, i wouldn't waste my $2.99 at blockbuster on this, put it toward a harlequin blaze title.

i went to see "passion of mind" because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances, i.e. "sliding doors," "me, myself, i," etc. but this was the worst one i've ever seen! i had to force myself to sit through it. i didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex; maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work.(originally written 5/28/2000)

i had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently. i had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my return flight as well. obviously demi's attempt to get some "arty" cred, the movie is a shambles because of her lousy acting ability. a better actress might have made this work, but a simple look at the face of moore shows the emptiness within. at least she's not ruining american literature this time out.

this movie defines the word "confused". all the actors stay true to the script. more's the pity, because the acting is fine, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas. the pacing is mind-numbingly slow, and the soft-focus-lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly. i give it 4 out of 10.

enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that i wish it turned out better. everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise, but it's too deep a vision, too involved attempt at disentangling mental delusion to survive a transition to the screen. it is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid -- the result is muddled and slow. i give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 overall.

greyfriars bobby was not a westie - bobby was a skye terrier. a highlight of my childhood day trips to edinburgh was to go to the monument to bobby. i grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog, as every child in my generation did, and i remember lining up with my mum outside the cinema - with many, many other dundee children and their mums - to see the wonderful disney film. how could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a westie, for heaven's sake. that's like making a movie about the life of robert burns, for instance, and portraying him as an englishman. i say,give bobby back his breed!

but like the disney film of two generations ago, this film fails as well in the accuracy department. but at least disney used a skye terrier.is the true story to mundane for movie producers? i don't think so. there is ample documentation to accurately portray they true story instead of the fictionalized accounts we have had to suffer through. some day, a movie will correctly portray bobby's owner, john gray, as the edinburgh policeman that he was, and correctly portray bobby's license a being paid for by the lord provost. when that happens, i'll be at the theaters.

they have taken a story dear to the people of edinburgh's heart, a true story and changed it as hollywood has done before to many a tale. the end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate. the original movie of this tale that walt disney himself oversaw used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that john grey was anything special he was a poor shepard who died in poverty at the inn. if you like the story, watch the disney original for a better heart- warming story. it's a shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale. read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story. and if you really like it, you can visit the real kirkyard in edinburgh.

like another user i got this cheap - i thought. 85 kroners (£8). although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i - like the other users - first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some 20 years after. the story is amazingly thin (which is why it might have worked for kids), but all the radio language and trucker stuff makes up for it. it'll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come. first viewing (1980): 10/10. second viewing (2002): 4/10

the plot: a trucker (kristofferson) battles a corrupt sheriff (borgnine) by getting his fellow truckers to band together and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy.the negative: the film's setup is weak and the ending even weaker. it has all the good-ole-boy/trucker clichés without adding anything new in the process. it ends up making smokey and the bandit look brilliant and inspired. kristofferson is much too laid back for a leading man role and cannot carry the picture. borgnine's character is portrayed awkwardly. at the start he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overacts to a minor contrivance that starts the whole thing rolling. then at the end he is made out to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly siding with kristofferson, which doesn't work at all. in either case jackie gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. the worst part about the movie though is director peckinpah's attempts to throw in a 'serious message' into this silly action flick that does nothing but slow it down and bomb in the process.the positive: the only good scene in the whole film is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant. director peckinpah puts a funny spin to his trademark 'slow motion' violence and the result is amusing. unfortunately he starts putting all the action into slow motion during the rest of the picture until it eventually becomes tiring. mcgraw is always a pleasure to look at, but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do.the lowdown: if you've read the synopsis than you have essentially 'seen' the movie. the song that this movie is based on is pretty good, but the movie adds nothing to it and should never have been made. this is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick director.the rating: 3 out of 10.

this film goes into my "worst films ever made" file. i have a copy of this film which i watch when i want a good laugh, and this isn't even a comedy. i am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. this film is inaccurate (in its portrayal of hockey), offensive (to canadians), and i wasn't even all that impressed with the acting. even the story was a bit weak. if you have never seen this film, you're lucky. if you have, i'm sorry.

the game of hockey i play and watch has something called "speed" which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing. add to that a storyline that is cliché, predictable and stupider than stupid with some of the lamest '80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have "youngblood". oh, keanu as a french canadian, yeah, whatever. gimme dunlop, braden and the hansons anytime... one out of ten.

another awful movie about hockey. i if never watched hockey and saw hollywoods version, i would hate the game. this movie doesn't make canada look that great either. i can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. all the same this movie is awful, with every thing you can put in a 80's movie. in the end don't even watch it on tv. 4/10

give me a break. how can anyone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? i know that movies tend to do a pretty p***-poor job of portraying hockey to the general public. and yes, this was made back when the u.s. hadn't embraced our sport to the extent is has today, but really. i have played hockey all my life and have watched even more, and this my friends is sheer lunacy. the scenes on the ice were stupefyingly bizzare... the particular instance to which i am referring is the "sword fight", er i mean the "stick fight" at the end of the film... during which everyone is just standing around and watching, not with fascination that this is actually happening, but in wonder as to who will win the duel between youngblood and his nemesis rakkie. yes the story off the ice is a little better, i do stress little.i don't know, maybe there is no point in going on... i mean let's face it: the film is right. hockey is just one big battle on ice... oh yeah with a little piece of vulcanized rubber bouncing around- occasionally into what is loosely termed a "goal". youngblood is either appalling or hysterical, i can't figure out which... maybe someone else will have more luck.

i should know better. i've seen too many of rob lowe's early work to expect anything good from this movie, even if it is about hockey.here we have, yet again, another tired sports theme. kid has potential for greatness, has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn't screw things up. and, boom, he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion. is that all that can be said of sports movies? surely, there must be other feats that athletes undertake.nonetheless, this movie has got to be one of the biggest cheeseballs. everybody's interactions are just downright silly, and not in a stupid-funny kind of manner. and i can't think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position. not the actors (certainly not swayze who plays lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music, and very little from the skating sequences. normally, i'm a sucker for 80s movies, even if they do tend to be a little fishy (i.e. north shore, the karate kid), but this doesn't even make for good 80s trash. for a good 80s sports movie, check elsewhere. there's plenty of them out there.

this movie is terrible. a true hockey fan would have to assume that the people that appeared in and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game. i got this hoping that it would be a "guy movie", but the only people that would probably enjoy this movie are females between the ages of 13-17. the hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc. it's so difficult to predict the end of this movie, though!! for those who have seen it, who would have guessed?? for those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!i figured it out less than halfway through the movie. to call this movie a drama is ridiculous!!

"speck" was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck. there is, however, not much killing to be found in this movie, and none of it is explicitly shown. the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub, yet even this is merely implied, and not shown, save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr. speck's leg. the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voice-over, which should be a testament to the mind-numbingly boring nature of this movie. every aspect of this movie is horrible. unless you have a fondness for boredom, don't bother. this movie only clocks in at 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.

where to start with 'speck' the true story of richard speck, a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s. director keith walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies (such as birth rite) and here works from a script by (at the time) full moon regular don adams. unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn't great, perhaps because the real speck's ramblings were not terribly interesting!? despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period (such as 'ed gein'). filmed in a dirty brown, not quite sepia, for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating, the colouring distracting from the story and the crime, though gruesome and upsetting to watch, is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events. there is no examination of the motivation or of speck's life really, just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime. released by full moon there is little evidence of full moon's better output here, charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings (e.g. dolls, monsters and so on) and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality. incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called 'shadow entertainment'. band has said that he regrets the period of full moon output alongside tempe entertainment (whose creator j.r. bookwalter and regular danny draven also speak very badly of charles band). the tempe era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal hand-held camera filming, very much like a home movie. speck retains these qualities and whereas witchouse 3, for example, managed to use these well, speck is merely boring and gross.

i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely, i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story. while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors. 1. speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie. in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. 2. the asian nurse who survived speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. this would have been impossible. in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims. 3. the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. not true. in reality speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them. this is how he was able to tie each of them up. 4. the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be. fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why. speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying, the voice over would be laughable. all in all, doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence. no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known, after all, for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them. beverly ann sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film. she is a very good actress. if you are at all squeamish, do not see this film. it's very graphic and disturbing.

rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck - that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review.it's a movie about the serial killer richard speck, who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties. watching the movie, one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. unfortunately, that doesn't make for a good movie.another problem i had was the near-constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie, and some god-awful narration letting us know what's motivating speck. the acting was average for this type of film; to give credit where credit is due, the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste. your mileage may vary.over all, if you're interested in the subject matter, it may be worth your time.

after matt dillon's phenomenal performance in crash, most will probably rush to pick up a copy of factotum to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script.well, factotum certainly has its moments, but the plainness of ...everything will most likely turn viewers off. however nothing should be taken away from dillon. his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor, proving he's a solid actor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script.the story is about henry "hank" chinaski (dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. he quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes, only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me).skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to jan (lili taylor, the haunting), a loser girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself, hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him. whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation. some may say that he never does, while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity.regardless, there's not much substance to factotum even with matt dillon's fine performance. the story meanders through hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. and that's a shame. dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script.

some twenty or so years ago, charles bukowski was a hero of mine. i blindly accepted the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films. of course, i never got to meet the intellectual types that prescribed bukowski as a hero. they usually could be found safely behind the counter at hipster video stores and record shops. these people hardly talked and when asked a question, usually sneered and nodded in some vague direction. they were useless when it came to locating a specific title, but their shelves were always stocked with strange and unique titles. to be inducted in the secret hipster club, i believed i had to shed my bourgeois up-bringing and espouse the counter-culture.my introduction to bukowski started with the movie barfly, the late 80's film that starred mickey rourke and faye dunnaway. i was a fan of rourke at the time. he also embodied a sort of modern male fantastical anti-hero, a brooding intellectual type. at the time, this appealed to me. barfly's hero scoffed at convention. a mid-30's tramp, who lives life with no ties, answers to no one, --oh--and to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob, icing on the cake. afterwards, i read post-office and hollywood, the later being bukowski's take on his experience with the film.now, allow me to fast-forward to the latest film based on bukowski's book factotum, one which i read and enjoyed. bukowski takes the form of chinaski in this novel. i often wonder where bukowski ended and chinaski began. 20 years after barfly, the fictional movie bukowski is still the same. i have watched about an hour of the movie and i have yet to see signs of the facade cracking. here is why factotum bukowski was my hero. chinaski is handsome (played by matt dillon). he has clean neat hair, styled, but not over the top. when dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. chinaski goes from job to job, ignoring and/or fighting with various bosses. he screws two floozies, one of whom he lives with, walks out on, only to return to with little repercussion. chinaski is his own man and we never see him emote. he's a sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something, james dean archetype. factotum lies to the viewer. it does so by haranguing the idea of a man (a writer) without consequence. a poor man, who's suffering for his art. what could be cooler than that? now, let's say there are some truths to factotum, in that the events took place. what the audience is missing is the pain that shrouds chinaski's existence. maybe the point of this movie, and most movies, is that for 80 mins., we need to escape the world that's filled with consequence and pain and take-up vicariously with an anti-social womanizer, that smokes, talks, drinks with detached coolness. one who rejects conventional behavior of job and family. my hero used to be movie bukowski. long ago, that would have worked. it was easier then. now, i have yet to claim a hero. things are not as easy. hipster logic and movie renditions of counter-culture icons offer no solutions or even ask questions.

a boring movie about a miserable loser...that's factotum in a nutshell. matt dillon plays henry chinaski, alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based. as we meet chinaski he may be a writer but he's certainly not a successful one. he floats through life, getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit. the fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with his not caring. he meets a woman, jan, played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues. chinaski moves into jan's apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else. good times. eventually he's had enough of this relationship so chinaski strikes out on his own. unfortunately he still can't hold down a job so soon enough he's broke. at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character, laura, decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesn't even know. we soon meet some of laura's acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch. soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again we're left with chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life. there's some more time spent with jan but mostly there's just time spent being a drunk, unemployable loser. and then the movie's over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on. nothing happens. nothing ever happens. if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you. if you're looking for a compelling story, well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you've come to the wrong place. dillon's performance actually isn't bad at all. too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad.

doesn't mean this movie is good. i was really frustrated by it on many levels. it's kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski. hey, i've read that guy in college--let's see what matt dillon does with him. and i like matt dillon. i thought he came close to looking a little like hank, but mostly just the ruddy cheeks. i have to care about a character, though, and there just wasn't much here to care about. i think time might be cruel to bukowski, and that bothers me a lot, because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time. hard to sit through, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. i ask for very little, got less.

this movie has some good lines, but watching dillon's less-than-masterful rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original. i like marisa tomei but she's no faye dunaway.also, in my opinion, the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about. you might not love the character, but you should care what happens to him. this is achieved in barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender. the main fight in factotum is when, completely unprovoked, he stalks up to the lily taylor character in a bar, punches her to the floor and calls her a whore.the whole thing just didn't work. again, some great lines -- some laugh-out-loud funny -- but as a movie overall it's a fail. mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant, and you can't get past that. next? let's remake breakfast at tiffany's with kate hudson.

clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowski's work. the autobiographical henry chinaski character in bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987's 'barfly', also starring faye dunaway. anyone who has seen 'factotum' should certainly see 'barfly' to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character. 'factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero. the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood-soaked rourke. rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a place-setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer. dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting, handsome, relatively clean-looking wanna-be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of chinaski's story. dunaway's sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well henry. the women in 'factotum' can't hold a candle to dunaway's 'distressed goddess' and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in 'factotum' proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships. i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'factotum' (marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip-off from 'barfly').if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film, see 'barfly' and 'love is a dog from hell' (which also goes by the title 'crazy love').

i have waited a long time to see this movie. ifc finally ran it one night. i thought it would be something like "barfly" from barbet schroeder. wrong. this film doesn't recreate that underworld of chintzy, dirty, smoke filled, character filled bars you associate with his stories. it also fails to capture that bukowski attitude that mickey rourke did so well in the above mentioned film. that natural smart-ass attitude. fans of charles bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen but those unfamiliar with his books could get the wrong impression about his works. this film looks like just another 'movie of the week" about a drunk and his relationships. if you want to get a better idea about charles bukowski's world watch "barfly".

in los angeles, the alcoholic and lazy hank chinaski (matt dillon) performs a wide range of non-qualified functions just to get enough money to drink and gamble in horse races. his primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women."factotum" is an uninteresting, pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble, being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior. in accordance with imdb, this character would be the fictional alter-ego of the author charles bukowski, and based on this story, i will certainly never read any of his novels. honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, better off watching the touching and heartbreaking hector babenco's "ironweed" or marco ferreri's "storie di ordinaria follia" that is based on the life of the same writer. my vote is four.title (brazil): "factotum  sem destino" ("factotum  without destiny")

perry mason: the case of the glass coffin finds raymond burr defending david copperfield/rick blaine like magician peter scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. a trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of nancy grahn comes a tumbling out.nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. first in a moment of drunken weakness, scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past.billy moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in grahn's home town. a little more action than usual for ken malansky, he almost gets himself killed. one big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. the medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that scolari could not possibly have done the deed. the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer. when you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how the investigating officer james mceachin got it wrong from the start. it kind of spoils this particular mason film.

the idea behind this movie was great. the story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog. the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. also, there is very tedious, almost funny, overuse of metaphors in the voice overs. the high point is the acting of the little girl. nice try, but this one's a stinker.

an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script, inept direction, and some of the worst score that i have ever heard. more tv movie of the week than serious drama. which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real. the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character, it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring. in my opinion, one the most blatant forms of cut and paste film adapting.

i would have given this movie a 1, but i laughed so hard, so many times, that i had to give it a little credit, in the off off off off chance the film was supposed to be funny. a movie so bad you'll think chimps wrote it. you'll wish chimps had written it. dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. the movie exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the original carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. like intersplicing scenes from taxi driver into baby geniuses. do not rent it alone, as you will not enjoy the experience. you will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing. worst actress of the millenium goes to poor poor amy irving as the stone-faced, monotone, disastrously wooden school counselor. worst movie of the year so far (see also _arlington road_). --frink-3

be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving "over sexed jocks". there isn't a thing redeeming about carrie 2. the plot is absurd, the acting terrible, and the ending all too predictable.i wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but i was expecting to be entertained. i wasn't. the only way i could rationalize watching this movie was because i was at a relative's house while waiting for my car to be fixed. unless in the same predicament stay well away from this film.

the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie. the acting was poor and the premise of sexual scorecards was revolting. the effects were marginal at best. there were no stand out performances, amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween h20 audience. the original was much more enjoyable and gratifying. i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years 10 best...so far it is at the bottom of my list. don't bother with this one folks!!

i thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had. this is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week. the original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel. one good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly, because the plot seemed rushed. when rachel's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. another bring down was the involvement of amy irving. all her scenes brought down the movies pace. the dialog in this movie was terrible. it in no way reflected the way kids talk. in conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene.

this is a treat for fans of z-grade movies. here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything ed wood ever produced. veteran bad movie actor cameron mitchell is a former makeup man from "paragon studios" who, after a nasty acid-in-the-face incident at a social gathering, becomes an embittered mad scientist (tm) with a rubber scar on his face who takes revenge by kidnapping paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his secret laboratory (tm) handily located in the local wax museum. or are they zombies who do his bidding? he's not sure. happily, many of your favourite movie clichés are here. check out the villain's lab! are those mysterious steaming vats of liquid? test tubes of coloured water with no explained purpose? yay! and what ho, do we see spare arms and legs arranged kinda casual-like on a wooden rack? you betcha! marvel at the bumbling detectives acting with straight out of plan nine! now, enjoy a stupidly tame car chase, and hear more dizzy bimbo screaming than you could possibly want. raise an eyebrow at the screwy plot line, made even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie. cheesy trash and much fun for the bad movie connoisseur.

definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be. nightmare in wax tells the story of a man, having had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene, wreak his vengeance on those directly responsible and those indirectly for the losses in his life - most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress. cameron mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair, albeit limited flair. actually, i thought he gave one of his better performances. what exactly does that mean? mitchell wears an eye patch, endlessly smokes cigarettes, wears a motley tunic, and talks to his creations in wax. they are not your ordinary wax dummies, but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological function. they become zombies in effect. i thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else. it has some ludicrous explanation, but does serve the plot. this is a film of the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic camera-work by bud townsend and company. the acting is mediocre but mitchell, scott brady, and barry kroeger give interesting turns. the wax figures of hollywood's bygone era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible. the end of the film dissipates into something not quite real - either another example of 60s cultural cinema or the end of the scriptwriter's creativity. i'm banking on the latter. despite its many flaws, i enjoyed the film. the opening scene showing an actor being needled was effectively done as was a police chase on the waterfront.

along with his turn in the super-sleazy 'classic' the toolbox murders (1978), this is considered the ultimate bad cameron mitchell horror effort. it's a little too slow-moving for my tastes, has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end, but mitchell's dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance-minded whack-job vincent rinard is fun. not anthony perkins good, mind you, but definitely fun enough. as a spoof of the shallow conceit that is hollywood, it's only so-so; as a horror movie it's also only fair. and even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture, it's just ok. i'm a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence, so i was also thankful for the appearance of the gazzarri dancers, who just rule. five of them do a crazy hair-thrashin', floor-slidin', hip-shaking' go-go dance routine to "don't cry, look for the rainbow" by the t-bones. watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringe-covered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why i give this a slightly higher rating that usual.former movie make-up man vincent rinard ("the best since lon chaney!") goes after people at paragon studios. a flashback shows how max black (berry kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, flung wine in vinnie's face right when he was about to light a smoke. he's engulfed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). now employed by the "world-famous" movieland wax museum in buena park, california, vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nerve medicine and special "vitamins and minerals"... watch out centrum!) to paralyze victims. they disappear and the dense detectives on the case (headed by scott brady) act baffled as new 'statues' are put on display in the museum. vince talks to himself ("i'm a terribly nice man!"), chain-smokes, mumbles, hisses and describes how he gets "excited" by the sound of a woman's scream.he also has to deal with a bunch of back-stabbing scumbags and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what's coming to them. there is also nick (hollis morrison), a boozy, inept museum tour guide who sees a 'statue' blink, but doesn't go to the cops. aside from max (a real grade-a jerk... who doesn't even die!) and the stupid cops, the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious. marie morgan (anne helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie (!), including vince, max and two of the wax dummies/missing male stars (i guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl). for some reason, she also begs and pleads in her irritating baby-voice for vince to give her a 'replica' of the head he's designing of the newest missing actor (and fiancé number 5) tony deen (phillip baird). she doesn't know that vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck, but i love it when mitchell dryly agrees with her demands "so you can completely retreat for reality." he also wants her to 'pose' for him, which means she's eventually held prisoner in a box. unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her high-pitched whines.the other "woman" is theresa (victoria carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. she's first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm-deficient by jiggling on stage in a lime-green fringe bikini. theresa is tolerable before she talks, but when you realize her grating presence combines the abrasiveness of lorraine bracco with the airhead mentality of the landers sisters, you wish vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible. unfortunately, we're first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid mitchell. she and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic, but function as a way to poke fun at the hollywood system in general, i guess. and i'm probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves. the pluses are few and far between, but include (other than mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell... married to marie!... yikes, now that is scary.also in the cast are director john "bud" cardos (also the production manager) as a police sergeant, james forrest as a film director, virgil frye as a statue, rini martin and kent osborne as a bartender. many of the people who worked on this one (including executive producer and script-writer rex carlton) also worked on the al adamson movie blood of dracula's castle and other atrocities.my score: 4 out of 10

in this horrible attempt at a blair witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to africa to investigate a creature called the half-caste. it's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of, and that everything was improvised. that can work if you have good actors, which this film didn't. this movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. as a result, there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do "quirky african stuff" like eating elephant dung. there is also some pretty good footage of lions eating (from a national geographic perspective) but there's not a single scare in the whole movie. if you've seen cannibal holocaust or the blair witch project, this movie will hold no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion footage on the discovery channel.definitely a half- aste effort. a note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save the "how i spent my african vacation" home movie for your family and close friends. nobody else wants to see it.

this film is what happens when people see like in this particular one blair witch project and say hell people running around with cameras, acting slash documentary themed no problemo i can do it and start out with a lame idea make up a terrible script and get a bunch of talentless actors and start shooting a film. plot is that in africa there a halfcaste a breed of man like animals who hunt and kill humans, the locals think that it's a demon or a evil spirit but our wild bunch are in africa to get some proof of there own. no need for more words on the plot this movie get's a 1 out of 10 and i am trying to find something good to say about this movie but after a long time thinking nothing nada zero null.

aside from the gunfight scene, i felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. robert duvall, kevin costner, and annette bening could have played those roles in their sleep. the dialog was marginally tolerable (and there was plenty of it--no one sat together quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to cram into the story, there was no subtlety at all--foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story (i think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything), and the editing really needed tightening up (each actor's screen time was more quantity than quality--again, too much dialog).the entire story took place over the course of a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions, much like how day-to-day happenings seemed huge to you in high school, but in the grand scheme really weren't that important. yes, the bad guys beat up and killed mose, they beat up button, they killed the dog--all things which would get boss and charley's blood up. but the importance was diluted by all of the "deep, meaningful" conversations which dominated most of the movie. these guys worked together for 10 years and they're just now talking about this stuff? the only time there wasn't much dialog was in the gunfight scene--which is probably why i liked it.finally, someone give annette bening a hairbrush! the wispy strands of hair around her face that were (i suppose) to make her look a bit more romantic actually made her look a little deranged. if she worked outside the home, it would have made more sense. plus, why wasn't she married already? there seemed to be several "kind and gentle" (her words) single men in town aside from the marshal and his cronies. in fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want her either (a usual plot device in other movies). she stayed cooped up in the house most of the time and really didn't seem to have much connection to the people in town. makes you wonder......in all, the movie was entirely too long, too chatty, and too contrived for me. it felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars, but not enough character depth to interest me, despite all of the dialog.

cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term "video nasties". this was a notorious british list containing all the films that could bring 'damage' to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). for gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies (faces of death, cannibal holocaust, driller killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror films (the burning, nightmare city, the toolbox murders). keeping this in mind, it's quite unusual to see "night of the bloody apes" listed among the other "nasties". it sure is gorybut the blood and violence are so poorly presented i can't imagine anyone would be offended by it. and the silly plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla's heart into the chest of his dying son) isn't exactly what you would call disturbingly real, neither. all that remains is a fairly amusing pulp-horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze. the man-ape make up effects are laughable and there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. enjoyable only if you're in the right mood, in other words. the few sequences showing detailed matches of lady-wrestling (which one of the lead-actresses does for a living) are very cool.

acclaimed argentine horror director emilio vierya directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross. cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness. a doctor's son is nearing his early death, until his desperate father transplants an ape's heart into his chest. as expected, things are going to get weird; when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves. when heroin is injected, his beauties become zombies. the monster summons his dazed minions with strange organ music. so bad...well...it's just bad. in the cast: jose e. moreno, alberto caneau, mauricio de ferraris, gloria prat and gina moret.

dr. krellman wants to save his son julio who's dying of heart disease. he decides a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son (no--i'm not kidding). he does the transplant and (somehow) his son changes from a frail guy into a muscle-bound man with a dime store mask that (sort of) resembles an ape! naturally he gets out, kills men, tears the clothes of women and wreaks havoc. this is all inter cut with the boring romance of police lt. arturo martinez and lady wrestler lucy ossorio. we also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot. it all ends by copying the end of "king kong"! this is (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. the plot makes little sense, there's the gratuitous female nudity (a staple of any exploitation film) and very graphic gore that looks laughably fake (except for the open heart transplant). still this does have merit. the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually aren't too bad as actors. also the dubbed in dialogue was (for a film like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. also i saw an excellent dvd print with bright strong color (which helps). we're not talking a classic here but an ok exploitation movie.

this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s. it's not that good, but really not so bad either. there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it (even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired "don't tamper in god's domain" b-movie fare). there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling, but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexico.the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy, but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorilla's heart for his son's to save his life (i don't know, i'm a lawyer not a doctor). the transplant works, but sonny-boy ends up becoming a man-ape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path. there's also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really didn't add too much, but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here's a good reason to do so).the film was kind of cheap, but not too bad for a b-movie of the day. the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't tied in that well. however, this film is kind of fun in its own way (i don't know why, maybe because it's a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet). i guess it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very weird things.watch it if you like cheesy foreign films, nudity, and female wrestlers.

mmmm, a previous summary says "if you like aliens and predator you will enjoy this film" i could not disagree more, this film pays no respect to its weighty lineage and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi strands to little more than a teen horror slasher movie, it has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous alien or predator movies and there is no discernible lead character, i really did not care about any of the characters and i positively yearned to see the stereotypical cast die as soon as possible in the vain hope something better would replace them, it really takes super human incompetence to have two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented positively fail to make a gripping thrilling movie, only watch this if you want to see how not to do it.

if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator- requiem is probably not the way to go. in summary, alien lands in typical american town, predator lands in american town, both have a bit of a fight, us government blows up town, some people get away.....i'm sorry i think i might have spoilt the ending. its easy to criticise someone who's being critical; people cry out, i bet you couldn't do any better! i bet i could ! having made this film,watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done; there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room.

holy crap, the beginning picked up where the first one left off (good start). then it goes downhill from there. you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera, a predator movie, and some crappy detective show. the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don't have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so (the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story).then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city.p.s- what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can't tell what's going on? seriously, movie makers, do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight.

where to start?? i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb, and all of those were positive. as for this..?mind-blowingly, hideously, tragically, embarrassingly, catastrophically, stupidly, irritatingly, completely and utterly beyond awful.i am stunned this got made, never mind given a theatrical release. i think i am literally in shock.i'm no "snob". i didn't expect beautiful film-making or intense character-depth, but this is truly beyond a joke. we simply must demand more from the films we see.avoid. like the black death.

this is the worst movie i've ever seen, and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 (which is made by me), anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie, i mean come on the actors had a bad performance, the story is just crap. i'm really, really disappointed they could have done better stuff, than this piece of junk. i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie. i wish that the production company could give back my money. anyhow i'd high expectations on this movie, and i've got disappointed. i don't recommend anybody to watch this. so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk.

if you are a fan of either of the two origin franchises (aliens & predator...duh...and even if you liked or disliked avp flick in 06) you will hate this movie. the innumerable plot holes, flakey and unbelievable human characters, terrible special effects and even worse directing and fight scenes make this one of worse films i've ever seen.***spolier*** one of the hundred huge plot holes included the pred/alien hybrid going from chest burster, to full-grown bad-ass in seconds (it takes off on an onboard predator-ship killing spree and wipes out a ship of preds before the ship even breaks earth orbit.) as if. in the first avp we saw a ship of sr. pred hunters drop off three juveniles hunters going on an "earning their stripes" hunting party, and then in the end saw them picking up the "honored body" of the juvenile that was left over at the end of the flick. are we expected to believe that the single chest burster hybrid killed all these sr. hunters before the ship even broke orbit? also, (and this was extremely cheap production value on the director/producer's parts) jars and jars and jars of face-huggers somehow magically appeared aboard the pred ship, even though the entire temple complex and queen alien were destroyed in the avp flick. these face-huggers end up playing an intregal part in movie...of course. and how about all these face huggers becoming full-grown aliens in a days time? what a joke. although there were many many more plot holes, i don't think imdb would appreciate me filling up their servers by writing them here.on the flakey and unbelievable characters, well, where should i go boys and girls? where to start...almost all of these goof balls are cliché people from other films or tv shows. the town bad-boy who left to avoid jail time but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day??? where did i see that? oh yeah, last season on jericho!!! then there's the 20-something town sheriff (a former trouble maker himself) who was best-friends at one-time with the bad-boy. where did we see that? oh yeah, jericho and walking tall! then there's the generic soldier (with no rank) coming home from some generic war-front that isn't met like a long-missed loved one and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her own front door by her daughter and husband. and who is this soldier? what did she do in the army/air force/marines/navy/coast guard? we don't know because the movie never tells us. but ... dunh, dunh, dunh...she was some kind of soldier/airman/marine/sailor/coasty that knows how to drive a stryker infantry vehicle and ...magically... a helicopter!!! this character is just a generic copy of every "coming home" service person...except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles to her daughter that cost several hundred dollars. these are things soldiers have to sign for and don't just "bring home." ugh!the special effects and fight scenes are what pi-sed me off the worst though. these are the things i enjoyed the most in the first movie...watching preds and aliens go at it! the way this was filmed though, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close up that you couldn't tell what was going on. you couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on as they were fighting it out. all in all, these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and the fanchise. no one is going to care anymore about seeing their favorite sci-fi movie monsters, and can only guess that the series will go down from here as producers won't like dump millions of dollars more on a sequel.

i am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but imdb does't have zero as rating option... worst movie i have ever watched.. story of the movie 1. predator ship crashes on earth 2. one alien and some face huggers are released and they start killing humans. 3. one predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans. 4. then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human, aliens and predator. 5. some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator. 6. the end directors should consider refunding money back to the viewers. if still you want to watch this movie, download from some torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you money.. all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth, you see just dark shadows even in action scenes.. too much violence.. i didn't expect it from a fox movie

anyone who watched "alien vs predator" must've known that the conventions of the "alien quadrilogy" were not exactly adapted for the film. amongst some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes, aliens with extremely long tails, and so on. however the idea of the predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldn't resist.i had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately i was wrong. for those who forgot how the first film ended, the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both species'.for this film, i'm going to just go through a list of "good" and "bad" traits.the good: lots of gorgeous people, especially the men. the bad: lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant predator/alien, and the predator.the good: an interesting idea of the predator planet. the bad: an inconsistent scale of a town. its a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewer system, and homeless. is it a small town, or a city? the police force is one sheriff and three deputies, or so i counted.the good: um.... the bad: why do these mutant aliens/predators grow so fast? in a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. i mean, c'mon...what are these things...chia pet aliens??? and while we're on this subject, why is it that an alien inside a predator's body mutates, but an alien in a human's body doesn't? does that make sense?the good: still thinking... the bad: why would only one predator come? and why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the "aliens," but it decides to murder a cute deputy, and then skin him and hang him upside down. i mean, so much for being incognito!the good: ah...i'm stuck. i guess there's lots of loud sounds! the bad: how do these mutated alien/predators procreate? apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion, they deposit several offspring into the woman's body. yeah, just what you'd like to see, eh? pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens- as if the previous way wasn't gross enough!!!. i mean, there isn't even an alien queen.the good: did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous? the bad: when a nuclear device blows apart buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast? and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot "i told you not to crash!" i mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he'll have no hair left!!!i could go on and on, but i think you get the message. mutated alien/predator bursts through dead predator's body, grows over the matter of a couple of minutes, kills all the predators and manages to get crashed on earth. more mutant alien/predators are created, while one measly predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. predator kills humans. mutant alien/predators kill humans. humans kill humans. sucks to be a human in this movie, eh?if you're impressed by lots of bangs and bumps, you'll love this movie.if you liked the first, i suggest you skip this sequel.

avp2 is an awful movie. the dialogue was pointless, the acting was pathetic, it had virtually no story line and you can't really tell what the hell is going on half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holes.but! you will love it anyway. because it pushes the boundaries on gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. they even kill children, newborns and unborn babies in this movie. you will be sitting there thinking "oh my god, that is disgusting" and they surprise you by killing the 'sexy chick who always makes it out alive' when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospital.it's like the movie industry has said "we know what we did in the first alien vs. predator movie was was bad, so we're doing it again but this time we're getting help from psychopaths with vivid imaginations" it's predicable, moronic and down right pointless....but you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it.

i loved the blood and gore. the kind of violence is what alien and predator movies are about which is no one is spared. this truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on earth. the answer to that is simple. we are screwed. the effects were beautiful. how ever there are some real problems with it.1) the acting was horrible on the part of the human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. the writers could have done sooooooo much better. the good part was the alien and predator acting which i thought was done very well for the most part.2) the size of the predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first avp movie. this i scratched my head on 3) predators having their mask on while still in the ship. this upset people and i cant understand why. its not a plot hole like most people make it to be. so i say to you people calm the hell down. its no big deal. if it will make you feel better, remember, they did have face-hugger's on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why.4) predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship. i thought that was rather stupid on the predators part. but then i began to think if it was a younger predator that panicked.5)the hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away. at least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min. so be happy about that.6) why did only one predator go? i thought this was odd. but then i thought that it was because he thought it was only one predalien that he was dealing with and not an outbreak.7) why didn't the predators in the ship self destruct? well if people were paying attention one did, but he was killed before he could completely activate it.8) the unlimited blue melting goo. i thought that was rather dumb.9) predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop. that was also dumb.10) the black out. well come on people, an alien and pred did fight it out at a power station.11) predalien being half face-hugger/queen. this really ticked me off. i am an alien and pred fanatic. i know for a fact that aliens do not do that!! just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in alien4!! out of all the comics, games, books, and the movies 1,2, and 3, clearly shows their behavior. they need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into face-hugger's, face-hugger's infect host, the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a predalien with a predator, and runner with any kind of four legged animal. and then after living for years upon years then they molt into a preatorian (a mini me queen that does not lay eggs) i can go on and on but i wont. but that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me. if the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women.any way if you are going to see this movie, just go see it for the aliens and predators. and when the scene comes up where the predalin infects that pregnant women... close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the alien and pred universe.

this movie made me watch paul w.s. anderson's avp1 and enjoy it! i am not even going to dream of comparing requiem to any of the alien or predator series' movies,this is a horrible teenage b-horror footage set in an american small town no one cares about.avp1 at least had heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie sets,it had bags of eye-candy not previously seen in any of the original movies - but was ruined by unconvincing characters/acting.requiem takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable level,and it also lacks in every other department just as much...it's a sacrilege to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish.

ed wood is rolling over in his grave. he could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste-hole. the worst script in memory (it makes "x-men 3" sparkle like "citizen kane"); the most amateur directing; pre-k cinematography; the cheesiest "special effects" (i'm talking about "friday the 13th" sequel territory); and throw in a pointless, revolting, deeply disturbed, maternity ward sequence. the lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on-screen is astounding. that the "industry" might reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess-pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm.

my qualifications for this review? i own all the alien and predator movies & i have and have read almost all the books i can find that are related to this series.i can safely say, this movie is a stinker. save your money & don't waste your time. if you like mindless action, mindless gore, no plot to speak of & like being taken by hollywood, see the movie.if you are a serious alien series fan, send a message to the over stuffed, over paid suits in hollywood & 20th century fox & don't give them a penny.this movie has so many plot holes in it you could sieve pasta through it. read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, it has all be said accurately, so i don't have to repeat them.the characters in this movie are cardboard. you want them all dead. and, the movie doesn't disappoint, almost all of them die. even the hot, bubble headed blond. do you feel sorry for her? nope. no plot, no character development....who cares. the predators are now idiots too. they scan everything but their own dead warrior. they are suppose to be a high technology society, right? in the predator movie, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. trophy kills. in avp, they scanned charles weyland and let him go because he had cancer. major plot hole!also, the r rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face hugger, lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is injected with chest bursters. she is implanted by the hybrid alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love scene-orgy and they all hatch in, say, 30 seconds. sensational gore a plenty, nothing more. these scenes are laughable, not serious. it is almost like the violence happens and the alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumbs up or a nod of some sort.the aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancing drugs. they develop fast and spread quickly all over the town, tons of them, everywhere in record spawn time. pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the aliens, aliens predator continuity.i have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore. laughable. as a movie, as a continuation of the aliens franchise and the development of the aliens vs predator franchise, this movie is a cheesecake cliché at best. if you have faithfully followed this series, all the rules are broken and the aliens and predators are reduced to comic book characters.there is not one fantastic, memorable action scene. there are almost no special effects worth remembering. there are no brand name actors. the plot is as thin as onion paper that ultimately ends with a, "we have two choices to get out of this mess...the hospital or the center of town!". i just about wet myself. the center of town means everyone is going to get nuked by big brother who somehow knows the town has been infested because they have an awac in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects red spots. i just about fell out of my chair. special effects red spot alien radar on an awac over middle america. i am splitting my gut laughing.having to get to the helicopter pad made me choke on my popcorn. has anyone played a game called zombies!? you have to get your playing pieces to the helicopter pad to win. i almost wet myself laughing.the ending is enough to make you shake your head in wonderment. who did 20th century fox hire to write this script!? oh, oh, ask me.... a grade 5 student. there really can't be any other answer. oh, yes there can be another answer... low budget cheesecake sci-fi.the ending? "col. stevens takes the predator pulse rifle to ms. yutani (francoise yip). she tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents. col. stevens knows yutani doesn't want the technology to use on earth." you are kidding me, right? ms. yutani? who is ms yutani? (forshadow:weyland-yutani: the corporation) she is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite far east wisdom, she says the world is not ready for the technology. seriously??!! the brothers dweebs (strause) as directors? who is responsible for this hemorrhage-abortion of a movie? they are the doug and bob mckenzie of directors and yet fox entrusted the flailing alien franchise to them. they are touted as special effects experts and yet the movie is all low budget special effects. hmmm, i see a pattern. laughable.this movie is only made to empty your wallet. it serves no other purpose. it has no plot. it has no main characters worth mentioning. it is disjointed. it does not adhere to any of the character principles established in previous movies. it does nothing to advance the franchise. the special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. and, it has no ending to speak of. it is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. nothing more.save your money. either watch it on tv where it will very quickly end up. buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding ulcer altogether. there is a reason why fox did not preview this movie to the critics. the critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it. jr giger, the original creator, is at this very moment, leaning over a toilet spilling his lunch.20th century fox, this movie is a stinker. it is as bad or worse than alien 3. you insult us. flush now...

when i saw alien vs. predator a few years ago, i have to say as stupid as a sequel it was, it was still somewhat enjoyable. now, there are unfortunately a shortage of good movies out in the theater lately, so my boyfriend and i decided to just go ahead and see what avpr: aliens vs predator - requiem was about. so we saw it a couple nights ago and i have to say that there was absolutely nothing thrilling about this horror sequel. it took a completely different turn from the first avp movie, it's not a bad idea that they took alien and predator and put them in the up class suburbs, but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing, this was just an average and predictable horror sequel. not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where i wasn't sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why, so i couldn't really keep up with the story.from what i've gathered, of course the predator and the alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors, they're just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not? go ahead and take it out on some earthlings. so they crash and alien is taking over the suburbia utopia. but teenagers, including a troubled couple who look like ken and barbie, a female marine and her daughter, among others, are going to make sure to kick some space butt, that is if the predator doesn't get there first. because he is ticked off at the alien, i guess for starting the party without him, lol, just kidding, actually for killing some of his friends.avpr: aliens vs predator - requiem isn't the worst movie by any standards, it's still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between alien and predator are so cool to watch. like the first sequel of alien vs. predator, the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed, i know it's horror, but the original alien and predator films had characters, that you cared about and wanted to win. but it was a semi-decent sequel that i would say is worth a look for some fun, especially for ken and barbie's sake.4/10

turd pie:* take x2 franchises * par-boil for 5 mins * stir in mixed cardboard characters (non actors work best) * add 2 tons of clichés then bake in your plot-hole microwave until bored. * serve with a sprinkling of dawson's crack (not a typo)voila! - money spinning brain rot for the emo/world of warcraft generation looking for the keys in drain was the best bit (?) aside from the first 5 mins, its one of the worst films ever made. utter, utter, nonsense.

this film and the 1st avp film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise.they are awful films, badly acted, badly scripted and terribly directed. they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out, quality production, they came up with the predaturd.the original alien/aliens/predator/predator 2 films were great, they redefined the horror/thriller genre by inventing these insane (and yet still believable) creatures who took the role of the 'serial killer', as opposed to a human. these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name.the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story. they were true to the alien/predator mythology, didn't crap all over the original stories etc... why didn't they make the comic book into a great film? because hollywood are idiots, thats why.

if only i had read the review by alex sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration. alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw 'alien versus predator'. it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you.right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun/not overrun by aliens. ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien/predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. from then on it gets really ridiculous. i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. i couldn't here.a father and son are hunting in the woods. the damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) i would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet.an edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. a slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty jock type (american sportsman not a scottish man). oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con's brother by the way. yes they're clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc, ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.guess what happens next? i won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien-ridden universe.the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late. the aliens are boring. the predator-alien is ridiculous. the action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! oh i was shocked alright. shocked at how low some people will go to get what? a scare? some shock? to titillate the perverse? what? if you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien/predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? the characters have no depth and neither does the plot. it's filmed and paced badly. it's acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them. it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you. if you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision.ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?

starting where the last avp left off, an alien "chestburster" emerges from a dead predator on a predator spaceship, and causes the predator space ship to crash into modern day gunnison colorado, where it breeds several more aliens which start to cause havoc. the predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed predator to "clean up the mess". our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. this movie moves along way too fast. the opening credits have only just rolled and already the predator ship crashes into the earth after the alien grows to full hight, a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed, then we see the predator home-world and the lead predator flies off to fight the alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. this unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie; the national guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face, the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. one moment our main characters are at home, the next running around town, the next in a gun store , the next in an apc, and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws.another problem is the settings and time frame. the movie is set in modern day gunnison colorado. every other alien and predator movie was shot in enthralling settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforest's, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. now comes along avp-r, set in a small modern day american town, with set "highlights" including a sporting goods store, parking lots, pizza shops, and little girl's bedrooms. i mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull, drab and uninteresting as possible?! it's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms.continuity is a big issue with this film. the alien series was set in the future, no human had even heard of an alien before the first film, and the aliens not only had never been to earth, but if they ever did reach earth, humanity would be destroyed. this movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day, with average joes seeing the aliens all over the place, and by the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. it pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies. attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive deus ex machina's. the predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes.also, for a "verses" movie, it has unrelenting bias in favor of the predators. for the majority of the film, a lone predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of aliens, all at mêlée range while barely gaining a single scratch, while the aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons, merely waiting their turn to be killed by the predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves. this movie should not be called "alien vs. predator", as much as it should be "predator massacres aliens". i mean, how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension, when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other? the characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws. not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous alien and predator movies, but even as a stand alone movie they are bland, dreary, and even at times cringe worthy. the characters in this movie consist of i kid you not, horny couples wanting to get laid, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, children, and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off ripley and newt; the worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters. not only that, but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers. while the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences, its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasher-porn movie, with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance, with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog. not only this, but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever, such as using predator guns, commenting the powers out when it has been for hours, following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly, and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration.in the end this movie is just a horrible b movie, something deserving of the direct to dvd category. the fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me, as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work.

with this movie i was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first avp, and yet to my horror: requiem is far worse than i could have imagined.my hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the predator ship, and i almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the predator home world (a throwaway digital matte painting, but still nice to finally see it) and then of course, the humans (if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such) are introduced...one must wonder why it seems to be impossible for fox to make a good film out of aliens and predators. at the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework.characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst friday the 13th sequel. the pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it. bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a real film, they make for a cheap flick, and alien 1-3 and the predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st alien is a "b" movie done as an "a" movie) the strause brothers really missed an opportunity, that could have been rectified by simply knowing their alien+predator roots: in both the alien and predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group (alien: refinery workers, aliens: marines, alien 3: convicts and in the predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit; predator, arnold--special forces, predator 2: danny glover, police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong: in alien ressurrection we have pirates...or something, avp we have...explorers?...with guns?? and of course in avp-r we have teen slasher clichés. what is there to identify with here? in concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a first blood type of action hero, but like many things it was never paid off.the film-making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. there is no sense of forward momentum to the action, just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting...taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. the action scenes themselves, though much ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit, it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur. basically, the movie is hindered from many levels. bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay (which as a screenwriter myself i noticed, seemed to hit every wrong note and cliché that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together) the writing, if it can be called that, is not even direct to video quality, nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series. why does the predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters? more than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first avp: as quickly as possible. why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks (meaning the supposed characters)substitute for real character development? (remember a character is defined by what they do, not say). why is the sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns? (isn't he an officer of the law?) how does the bimbo of all people know where they are? why does the predalien wait for the predator to very slowly remove his mask before it attacks? why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series-post-alien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run? how on earth did this series devolve to a character saying "people are dying...we need guns!" (how this writer even works is beyond me, and reflects badly on fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. it's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the film-making process. the effects are pretty lousy this time around. the aliens look like men in suits and adi is just getting lazy with their creature design. the aliens look like modified leftovers from alien resurrection, with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design, nor a good one to recycle. again, everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. and just like in avp, stan winston is sorely missed when the fake looking predator face is revealed.there are too many faults to list so i will just say this: do not waste your money on this movie. fox is beyond caring about the fans, as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of. i felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her profusely after. this is one die-hard fan who is done with the franchise.note to fox: what we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick, it was a film adaptation of the original darkhorse comicbook, which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993.signing off.

i was only fourteen when i first saw the alien movies and i immediately came to like it. original, terrifying and classic. sigourney weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her act. in 1979 something everlasting was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first. alien3 was a different point of view but i think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favourite. unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. it was strained, illogical with full of meaningless massacres. i didn't like it at all, but i never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future. well as it turned out in 2004 i was wrong. alien vs. predator was a bad break, and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all. but when i saw alien vs predator requiem i was totally shocked moreover devastated. when i sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt, even than i had never thought that such a bad movie could be made. without a screenplay, without a director and without actors i don't understand how can a film be made. because this film misses these three terms. what you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues. waste of money and waste of time. this movie is rather impudence, than honor to the fans of the both sides (alien/predator). shame!

i'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. the sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute, and the action was contrived and far from the heart pounding brilliance of each monsters original films. the best part of avp-requiem is in fact the trailer, which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about. i gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude. the movie played out like a color-by-number sci-fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you'd seen it a thousand times before. the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us. but what drew people in when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the alien trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief. this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from. because to be honest, seeing a waitress killed by the alien we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us. lets take the series back to its roots. learn from the former masters and don't mess with a winning formula by trying to make a 'bold new vision' we liked the originals for a reason, we want to see that again. lastly, the ending is the real wtf moment of the whole film, *spoiler* after the big climax, the survivors are ambushed by special-ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying 'we were following orders' and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into saviors. then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking ominously into the heavens, we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger i've ever seen, with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (save the government dude) then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci-fi channel original movie blush and turn up its nose. so, in summation, if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.

there was a time when the alien series was a success with even the third installment, alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young david fincher. the first predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story, "in peak" star arnold schwarzenegger and director john mctiernan (die hard). the films alien, aliens, alien 3 and predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. arguably predator 2 and alien resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises, but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. step in paul w.s anderson, alien vs predator, and now the brothers strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). the problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the sci-fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity, epitomised by incompetence. upon witnessing alien vs predator requiem (avpr) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.one example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. the film begins with an alien making its way onto the predator ship, spurting from the predators chest, growing in to a full grown predalien and bringing down the predator craft (which now seems to have far less predators on it than it did at the end of alien vs predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in earths atmosphere. once the ship has crashed avpr quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. the wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace, punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of alien and predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. avpr is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. this is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. independently the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. this is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first alien. because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.on a cinematic note the film is close to being dire, i felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen, the lighting was so bad. through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. as with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable, in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original alien by literalizing it. the directing is poor, performances weak and the script rotten. avpr is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. this is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. avpr was purely a business venture and nothing more.

susan slept here turned out to be dick powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen. of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died. it's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in the bad and the beautiful.frank tashlin has done so many better films, i'm still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one. the premise is absolutely laughable. dick powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he's been writing. he had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in herb vigran and horace mcmahon deposit 17 year old debbie reynolds on his doorstep. she's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system. so they give her to dick powell at christmas time.i mean is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem? the term jailbait comes immediately to mind. additionally powell has a girlfriend, the young and sexy anne francis. why debbie reynolds is any competition here is beyond me.susan slept here got one oscar nomination. the song hold my hand, sung by don cornell in the background, was nominated for best song, but lost to secret love. powell and reynolds do have some funny moments together and alvy moore as powell's factotum and les tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs. but it's not enough.

this movie is simply rubbish. i have to say i am an expert of rubbish movies. i reserve the "1" rating for movies that are rubbish but funny, but this film is just tedious and certainly not crappy in a funny way but crappy in a crappy way. it gets a "2" so those of you out there can distinguish between the ones that will make you laugh and the ones that will make you fall asleep. there are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something, their expressions are of amazement and there wide eyes and slack jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly amazing, this simply isn't it's just a cupboard or even more desert. it has to be pretty god damn awful for me to walk out, let me tell you, i walked out and so did quite a few people.

if you suffer from insomnia then radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7-year coma. the film is so preposterously overwrought and mundane that it's hard to imagine that director steve mahone could overlook such obvious dullness.the story has an exiled doctor (who we never get to see) move out into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts full of antibodies that can combat any infection (yes, just like that episode of futurama). the vaccines don't work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours.not wanting to be caught by the government guys in masks the group head into the desert for cover, hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus. all of this is narrated by michael, the only one of the quartet immune to the infection. and it's the most boring narration ever. they could have cast someone with an interesting voice but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than clive owen.on top of this the editor insists on fade-cutting more than half the movie, giving it a weird dream-like feel and increasing the audiences desire to go to sleep. it's no surprise that half of the audience walked out of this, i was not one of them for some reason. but i bloody well should have.the ending is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding. but it's plain and simply not. a relief yes, but not dramatic in the slightest.the utter cheapness of this production and muffled sound that renders a lot of the dialogue unintelligible cripples what could have been an interesting sci-fi story if it had better actors, cooler locations and a sense of urgency. as it is, radiant is a snoozefest.

well........how and where do i start to describe this utter nonsense? imagine the morals of a cheesy hollywood western, throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline, and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something 'contemporary'. this film is all package and absolutely no substance.it starts with promise......young men dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive hero-worship everyone can laugh at. after that, it all goes downhill.....quicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes. the scene involving the first gig with steel dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of 'cine kitsch' i have seen in a long time. the singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs.....will he get up and sing???......or will he stay there on the floor and not sing......who cares by now?? it gets worse, but i don't want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail. if you watch it after this review, its your own fault!

this is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of rob halford from british metal gods 'judas priest' and how the band replaced him with ripper owens, who used to front a priest tribute band. originally titled metal god this movie could have been something great. instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. from the title change of metal god to the 'safe' middle of the road 'rock star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. having spent most of my life in a professional metal band i was really looking forward to seeing this, i was very let down by several points of the film. the soundtrack is very not metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. the movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)a movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)there is nothing metal about marky mark or jennifer aniston. if bon jovi, warrant, def leppard and poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. if iron maiden, judas priest, dio & black sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.

i don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliché not used in this movie. ouffcourz , rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. say it to stupid young boys. the filmmakers seemed to have read too much guns'n'roses or motley crue stories. i have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie. if you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. just sleep. because you must be fresh, sober and clean in evenings. after live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement. then you have a bit time to have fun. but its not any luxury or dream. artistically this film was zero. stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. the ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! yeah, what a moral. real 90s.

no emotion. bad music (and i am a reformed eighties metal guy, so i would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) everything is half done. the brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next. the tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time. wahlberg is okay and aniston is slumming. we know she didn't need the money. is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on vh1--which is only slightly less often than ozzy does. it barely qualifies as a tv movie. it's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.

here is another great film critics will love. the problem is that it is not a very good movie.the films premise is simple. nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.the first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.the two halves simply don't mix. individual scenes do work very well (the guys crashing a friends house who has a new filipino bride is hilarious while a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) they simply don't mesh with each other.the movie as well is missing entire set-ups. one scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. the very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. where did they get the dresses and wigs? (the crew includes both the big guy and a midget) how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? and most puzzling is why are they in drag? they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (in fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) the movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. as we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. it is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.9 souls is a big disappointment, the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.

the idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. especially because it's meant to be funny and i guess heart-warming in some weird way. the problem is, the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross. it was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff. also, the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end. and as far as being gross goes, i just didn't need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!all in all, i really hated this movie. and it's a shame, as i almost always love japanese films--just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one.

critics love this movie. i personally found it senseless and tasteless. this is the millionth time i've fallen into the "critics love it" trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. there are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. a warning to animal lovers: don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested.if you want to see a good asian film, see afrika. if you want to see a film about escaped convicts, see the gene wilder/richard pryor classic stir crazy. avoid 9 souls like the plague.

you have to acknowledge cimino's contribution to cinema. he gave us both the most over-rated film in history (the deer hunter) and the worst film in history (heaven's gate). and before you start with the 'it's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. for 20+ years i listened to the critics and avoided "heaven's gate"-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. then a few days after seeing the 'final cut: the making and unmaking of heaven's gate' documentary i stumbled on a used $9.99 dvd of the long version. my advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. then you will have an idea of just how big a mess cimino made.while pretty much everything is wrong with this film, what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to johnson county and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. on the morning of april 9, 1892, nick ray and nate champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and texas hired guns who had come to johnson county to clean out "rustlers." the citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the army. women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from ray and champion there were minimal casualties. after all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the indians). and weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of johnson county residents were hanged without trial including jim averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife ella watson (who cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows averell living to a ripe old age). there is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. perhaps it is harsh to blame cimino for his distortion of history. he could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. if cimino was insane during the production of heaven's gate it would explain a lot of things. but my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.there are some good things about heaven's gate. you can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. isabelle huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). the dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.but don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. this implies that there was a method to cimino madness. 'experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. the simple fact is that there is no evidence cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. what it looks like is that he just turned his dp loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. the final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'fiddler on the roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. after you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'the grapes of wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. this is probably what cimino's mother did after writing that review.so believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. it is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the american west.

i can't give it less than a star, i tried. at this moment, im not sure if im halfway through it or not, but i stopped actively paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream. or not. or maybe it was. i think viewers who posted a comment that didn't include the descriptions "horrible" or "awful" or "made me want to swallow a bullet" are probably being nice because it is an indie film. don't listen to them, listen to me- there is no nudity in the movie, skip it. i needed ten lines to submit this warning, so i will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as "hot" is fat. she has fat elephant legs.

do not be misled. this is not a zombie movie. take it from a guy who loves zombie movies, and who rents them all: the good, and the horrendous. yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it's basically an artsy-fartsy exercise in existentialist dread, which is a long way of saying it's boring. if you've worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained, rent something else."rise of the undead" has cheap special effects, mediocre acting, and crummy dialogue. all of that is understandable in an indie, low-budget film, and i can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell. unfortunately, "rise of the undead" hardly has any story at all. moreover, the acting is not laughably bad so much as non-existent. all of the actors seem to have studied at the buster keaton school of wooden faces. would it have killed them to show some emotion? (and no, yelling does not equate with emoting). the one character who actually had some pizazz was killed off first. granted, there was another character who briefly held my interest. he looked and acted like kyle mclachlan channeling norman bates, but it was too little, too late.the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail: film is a visual medium. that means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view what's going on. and all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time, but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing. there is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple, clear fashion -- just look at george romero's low-budget "night of the living dead" to see how it's done superbly. and i know these folks had a small budget, but if you can't hire the equipment and technicians necessary to actually make the dialogue audible, then just go ahead and make a silent movie (then those buster keaton wooden faces might actually work).i will say this for the film: the zombies were creepy. unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory, the grosser the better, the zombies here were just shuffling, bloody-faced people. it actually worked to make them more like us, and therefore, scarier. that's the reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.the sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws, "rise of the undead" does not insult your intelligence. the filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart, scary, original movie, and it's a shame that they failed so miserably. if they could just forego the too-fancy editing, buy a few extra lightbulbs, crank up the dialogue, and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere, then i think they have the talent to make something really good.trust me: do not waste your time on "rise of the undead."

hey, i'm a fan of so-bad-so-good movies but there's nothing so-bad-so-good about rise of the undead. it's just so-bad and that's it. no redeeming cheese, no unintentional humor, nothing! - boring apocalyptic zombie (the "undead" : a few people with hardly any make up) nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call those effects), dumb plot and annoying actors. they also have the nerve to rip off and quote from other (better) movies (resident evil, dawn of the dead & night of the comet) and managed to put me to sleep on the side. however, it was rise of my eyelids once the end credits rolled though. my advice: save your money. it's not even worth a rental, unless you want to p*ss off and/or put some people to sleep then go ahead and give it a spin. you've been warned ;)

so, you've seen the romero movies, yes? and you've seen jacob's ladder, right? and the later hellraiser movies? okay, now let's make a movie out of all three, only let's just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it, sounds like a good idea?this movie is terrible. absolutely god-awful. yeah, it's an indie flick, who gives a crap? is that a pass to make filmic excrement? the film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction, that much is evident. unfortunately for the writers, they're not good at character interaction. this isn't night of the living dead; the characters are nonentities shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set. the dialogue is never interesting. for a movie that focuses so much on character interaction, you'd think the characters would have something more to say than "what are we going to do" "i don't know" "well we've got to do something" "well what are we going to do?" "i don't know." "we should leave." "let's just accept our fate." "no, we've got to leave." "well let's leave then." "no, maybe we should stay."this isn't exaggeration, there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanity.the worst thing about this movie? half of it is a dream, and it really has zero purpose. nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie. the writers couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both. it's patently ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and it's maddeningly insulting, especially since i'm pretty sure they ripped off the idea from jacob's ladder, which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these jokers could ever hope to do.and then there's the editing. years of watching mtv and playing horror-themed video games must have inspired the filmmakers, but it's surely a sad thing they didn't realize what made the choppy editing and obfuscation in those pieces of media effective in the first place. in this film, you will be confused often, and not in the good, david lynch way, but in the bad "wait i thought she just got killed, no? then who the hell was that? wait, who is that guy? where did he come from? how did they get here?" kind of way. it's constant and consistently bad.this movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get trashed with a few friends and laugh at it.and as a final note: as for the "comedy" people in other reviews are talking about, it's all unintentional. there isn't a single intentional piece of comedy in this film. it's all supposed to be a big serious character study, because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horror-concept. sadly, their pretensions don't match up to their ability.

i watched this last nite with an open mind. sorry to say it is still bad. first, the movie is too noisey and you can't hear what people are saying. the accents are bad especially richard masur. what is the french chick doing in this film ??? miscasting at its worst. walken's makeup is strange. the harvard scene is useless and not needed. kristoferson's character is unlikeable and i wanted him to get killed and go away. meanwhile, the walken character gets killed too early and easily ( despite the makeup). the settlers are all stupid. get organized you bunch of hicks, people are coming to kill you !!!!! john hurts character provides some humor buts thats all.i have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap. the only good thing is it ruined the director's career and killed united artists.still crap after all these years.

i have just recently seen heaven's gate. after i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western, i read the book by steven bach. after considering all events and the movie itself, i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. i believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. if for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie, i have to ask why. though this isn't a reason to hate it, it is historically way off. it pretends to be about a situation that happened in wyoming called the johnson county war. simply, the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. you find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then, something would happen. everybody in the movie talks about things that happen, and it is never shown. after you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens. oh and by the way the johnson county war was not a war, it never happened. the johnson county war, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in actual fact, 2 people died. i can't warn you enough off this movie. however, if you're like me the, the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put united artists on the "for sale" lot, sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means, watch this terrible, narsisistic, movie with no sub-text, and a lot of photography.(which is lovely sometimes)

the film, heaven's gate, was a good view, although still tedious at over 4 hours. but the film took great license - as usual with hollywood. james averill (chris christopherson), and "elle" were actually married in real life. their main contribution to the johnson county war, was to start it by being hanged. well, by starting it, i mean it came at the beginning, not the end. here's the real scenario: james averill and ellen watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. by filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. they chose homesites on crazy woman creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the cattleman's association. he offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused.although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (cattle kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. it is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the cattleman's association of receiving the cattle in trade for "lewd acts'. in the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. so much for this part of the myth of the "american west", which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years.in real life, she and jim averill were surprised one day by several members of the cattleman's association, taken in hand, and promptly hanged. those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. but that was the first link that led to the murder of nate champion, and the start of the johnson county war.quite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end. other than that, i think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing.

the operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been "never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene." this was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the harvard class of 1870. the point of that scene, i suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in johnson county, wyoming, but it just keeps going and going, and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness, made even worse by the fact that i found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. in the end, i couldn't even watch this in one sitting. i got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before i could drag myself back to see how it turned out.my reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame, because there are positives here. the performances are generally of a high calibre, especially from kris kristofersson as averill, christopher walken as champion and isabelle huppert as ella. the basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in johnson county and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. there's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. having said that, the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. in the end, all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around. seriously - 2/10.

the director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. too bad the producers and writer/director, michael cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about. a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. the cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. the entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.the worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. the peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies. the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william (red) angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the ta ranch. i doubt any women took part in the siege. ellen (ella also known as cattle kate) watson and her second husband, james averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion. ella was never a prostitute. this was a canard spread by the wyoming stock growers association (wsga) in order to discredit her. the fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the wsga.i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. there is no fact in the events, time lines, or backgrounds of the characters. why michael cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.the movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the federal government intervention in a state government's affairs and what happened after the wsga gunmen were saved by the calvary. some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible by the johnson county attorney. but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the governor of wyoming, amos w. barber, backed the wsga, the charges were eventually dropped.overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the dvd version.

now infamous western that was (at its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in hollywood history. i was "lucky" enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. it was truly staggering how bad the film was!they had a great cast, a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and americans in the 1800s), magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? three words--director michael cimino. he was so full of himself after "the deer hunter" he went out and made this god awful western. he's not totally to blame. his previous film "the deer hunter" was considered a masterpiece and united artists gave him free reign to do anything. they let him all alone...and everything went wrong. the cost went barreling out of control and cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect.first off, the sound is horrible. entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. for instance, jeff bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence, but i still have no idea who he was! the dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! that's the director's fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. the story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--cimino turns it into a massacre. there is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that way.this garbage effectively closed down united artists and was the end of cimino's career. a textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. jeff bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. this is from a guy who made "tron"! a definite must-miss.there is a pretty good book called "the final cut" which details the whole disaster. this gets a 1. i wish imdb had negative numbers--this deserves it!

this is the movie that, pretty much, sounded the death knell for the auteur in hollywood. at over 40 million bucks, heaven's gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure. what really galls me the most about it is that technically it's very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it. john hurt's commencement speech at harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard masur at the train station. some people seem to think cimino intended this as a "style". he didn't. it's just bad sound recording. the characters are not particularly well-drawn, except for the four or five leads; in the climactic battle scene, it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys. even on that level, it's impossible to enjoy the movie. the casting of isabelle huppert as the town madam is a joke, her french accent renders the whole character a fraud. the acting is generally stiff, without any range or depth of feeling; even christopher walken is bad. john hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality (although hurt, in his 40s, playing a fresh-faced harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous).  i guess to say that it's overlong is overkill. the roller-skating sequence could have been easily cut, the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche, and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone. having rod serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale. actually, those scenes in and of themselves are not bad, but cimino has not earned the right to include them, because what he's given us as the "meat" of the picture is so incompetently bad. the editing is poor, especially in the grand battle climax. at one point, the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times. i wish could i say something- anything- nice about this movie: a great scene, a great performance, even one memorable line of dialogue, but i can't. it is all just one big unholy mess. about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations, which are stunning. even cimino couldn't screw that up. this is a long, boring, bad movie by all standards. and the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves. 1/2 * out of 4

let's see. what annoyed me most? the extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much i got dizzy... without even showing where the music was coming from... all part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. what a drag this film is. and the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders. "these people are bad... these people are good". whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve i am beside myself. there's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place. long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. john hurt's character, who is part of the overlong beginning scene, drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. his death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. and i hear everyone, even the haters of this film, talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is. i think it looks washed-out. watch "days of heaven" if you want to see gorgeous backyards. this movie is even worse than the anti- hype. it's pointless. the epilogue, showing the main character in a yacht, was almost as dumb as the prologue. the battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. this movie is really bad. avoid it unless you love bad movies, because this is the king of them.

bank heist / cop thriller sounds ok right?chaos looks good: nicely framed, good production values, high concept action heist... but...the plot has the unique achievement of being both smart and incredidly, blatantly implausible in the "how we actually got the money" mode and overcomplicated in the "who done it and why" section at the same time...in addtion, ryan philippe shouting is not, seriously not either tough or scary...and he is especially not tough or scary when throwing a tizzy fit. honestly, his great outburst is the only really funny scene in the whole film. must make him thrilled that he turned down the role of anakin skywalker and is now doing this.... stratham is normally good as the tough but silent hard nut with the self-deprecating humor, but here, the extra relationship lines are so laughably bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the clichéd mush required. more silent seems best? snipes is actually ok in a typecast way, but another nail in a talented actor's coffin: he needs an actor's role not an action hero rehash. perhaps that business with his taxes will allow him to break that mold and the public and critics will let him on the sympathy vote. it would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time.the lines these guys speak when they're not doing the plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word.... pheeeuuuh.the film feels all out of whack and it never gels: i found it irritating for the first 45 minutes, and the tighter last part was passable. it should /could have been good but it just can't redeem the awful lines, the overwhelming score, and the general level of irritation with the levels of plausibility. overall i nearly didn't make it through: incredibly irritating, and ryan.... please, please, please get rid of the goldilocks....

the film "chaos" takes its name from gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie "chaos"? nothing. the film makers seem to have skimmed the book (obviously without understanding a thing about it) looking for a "theme" to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film. in this respect, the movie "choas" resembles the canadian effort "cube," in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed: in "cube" a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes: the same approach is taken in "chaos": disconnected extracts from gleick's books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever. this, of course, is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience, and any literate viewer of "chaos" who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered. how could a film so bad be made? rewritten as a novel, the story in "chaos" would probably not even make it past a literary agent's secretary's desk. how could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film? regarding what's in the movie, every performance is phoned in. save for technical glitches, it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene. the story is uniformly senseless: the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight-year-old. among other massive shortcomings are the following: the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow. he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints. police officers do not carry or use radios. dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy. let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film. if there is any other movie you like (or even simply do not hate) watch that instead.

i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. in other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. howsoever, at the end i realized that mr. tony giglio was earnest about this movie. it's a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! poor ryan phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! what to say for jason statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... for this reasons i vote: 3/10

obvious tailored vehicle for ryan philippe. it seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like he's eternally 16 (he can't).heavyweights jason statham and welsey snipes serve as bookends to phillippe, but when they're not on the screen phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.the script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s tv cop shows, such as "the streets of san francisco." snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain, playing a slightly less crazed madman than his demolition man role. however, there wasn't much for snipes and statham to chew on. statham's character announces he'd given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.truly forgettable moment: ryan phillippe expounding on buddhist dogma: galloway: are you a buddhist? dekker: no. it's just something i picked up along the way.

i went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, chaos is terrible. this movie has absolutely nothing going for it - it should not have been made.don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers, cause i'm going to address a lot of plot-holes here.first of all - the opening scene. it's the great big event that made the two semi-lead characters (statham and snipes) turn crooked. but it's boring and mundane. only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you won't care anymore. also - this whole event, where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as referred to in the movie.then the bank job - it doesn't get off the ground for any second. the bank robber makes some un-needed references to chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story, by the way). the way statham gets summoned is very 'die hard with a vengeance', but more boring. then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless. -what's with the safety deposit box. there seems to be some plot unfolding there, but then, it doesn't. -why go through the trouble of stringing up two people, when it leads to nothing? it involves a lot of preparation and it's used for nothing at all! -why doesn't the swat leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down?and this is only the first 10 minutes. it keeps getting worse and worse. -the whole romantic / love interest story (with the 'he wasn't just a better cop, he was a better man' remark to finish it of) is painful to watch. it's just pointless -why would statham's character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank. this essentially leads to finding the 'virus' that will get him all the money. -why go through the trouble of forging some guys signature and killing him, but then not kill the guy that can identify you.i could go on for ages (really), but it's like this movie is... pointless. the whole script is a mess. the 'smart' references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic. the plot 'twists' can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time. it is really painful to watch a movie like this, where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn crunching people, of which the director hopes they won't see all the plot holes and the over-all ridiculous script. the 'explanation scene' at the end only adds to insult. it is really, really not a good movie. in any way.people who come to see an action film don't get what they come for. people who come to see a cop-buddy movie don't get it. people who come to see a smart thriller don't get that. in essence, everyone gets the same - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. do yourself a favor and skip this one.

the recent death of stephen bach, one of the producers of heaven's gate, has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. moreover the original release, the "long version" was recently shown on tcm exposing the film, in ail probability, to its largest audience ever. i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd avenue cinema across the street from bloomingdales. i think it was released on a friday and withdrawn on the following wednesday. maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to articulate why.first there is the dreaded phrase "mise-en-scene" whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. for example, a crowd extra will be given a piece of action, say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. if there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on "action". all of the extras do this. then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. this is mise-en-scene. in the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.the importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene, even more derogatorily referred to as a "traffic cop". an auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. the metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. it is the difference between say john ford and sam wood.the second point is how the director, michael cimino, got into the position of directing films. cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar tv commercial. this depicted a chevrolet floating down the grand canal in venice. this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. so cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.his first film, thunderbolt and lightfoot (1974) has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. i had the feeling that if the producer, eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.which brings us to heaven's gate. i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. this is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. there is the opening 40 minutes, which takes place at harvard. brilliantly photographed at oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _"now i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna tell you" of most films. however the whole preface adds up to only one line- kris kristofferson and john hurt went to harvard together. now twenty years later all of that time, money and effort, not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.then there's the scene in the street between kristofferson and masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. it's just so exhausting. there is just one scene after another like this. it's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, witless dialogue, which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. but don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. "that's symbolic," he said, "of he doesn't know which way to go." that is basically, at its kernel, the basis of every pro- heaven's gate critique.watch it, if you must, but be forewarned, this is not a film whose time has come, this is a stinker which will smell for all time. heaven's gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme. i recommend the book banditti of the plains by asa mercer on the johnson county war.

**warning - this review may contain spoilers ** the idea behind the character of danny (jet li) is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck.however, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability.he has danny meeting a blind pianist, sam (morgan freeman), who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive step-daughter, victoria (kerry condon). i was stunned, by the way, when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me.amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoria.when danny turns up again, wounded, what does sam do but take him straight home. danny is out for 2 days, but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital? nooooo. i don't know if they even called in a doctor.now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the get-go, yet sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange, young man.why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i can't even begin to guess. surely mr. freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck.then we have bob hoskins as bart, the gangster who "owns" danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill. the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and clyde's demise. we think he's dead, but no.then we have another car accident - and yet again, ol' bart escapes unscathed.in addition to that, we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more. i don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight, when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die, i think anyone would fight.as i said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it. it's not just a case of suspending belief - it's completely beyond that.furthermore i never did understand why danny's mother who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is, became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot. maybe that was my fault, i got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths.4 stars out of 10 - and that's being generous.

apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger, this film is not worth seeing.the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what is going on at any given time, and just when you think you're following then the direction changes again, like a lost bi-polar puppy dog.the musical score is awful, relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way, as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet  'feel sad here'; 'feel shocked here'; 'feel scared here'. on top of that, the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter.gone are the days of silent film, where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice  but you wouldn't think so while watching river queen.the voice-over was so over-utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery. it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story.and the stolen ideas from jane campion's the piano are too obvious to overlook. not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano  perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollinger's camera work on the latter  but the voice-over feeling and levels too are strikingly close. and who could forget when holly hunter's character has her wings clipped, in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill. does it remind you of when wiremu has his 'trigger finger' amputated, and surprisingly too with an axe? i thought so.all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing, unless you wear some ear-muffs and just go with the scenery in mind.

river queen's sound recordist should have been fired, in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. mumbling voices was the end result, and the cinematography was average to fair at best. the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming. its obvious that the movie was suffering from el cheapo budget syndrome, and the scene where temuera is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words. i noticed a few shortcuts taken on the maori protocol side of things, but this was probably due to movie length time restraints etc. all in all i wasn't impressed with this movie, the whanganui river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold, drab and claustrophobic image, with none of the beauty. the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less on screen confusion, better sound recording, and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen. hats off to all involved though for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo. i have the utmost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, sadly i did not enjoy this one.

wow, i just got one watching this.how crappy post production is on this movie.i kid you not, i literally could've done a better job myself.all of post production is flawed, all of it. whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry.that aside, the script was a trainwreck. absolute rubish.not to mention jack bauer and his patchy the pirate in spongebob accent. wtf is his character doing there? but to me, the biggest flaw of all was character development, intereaction, dynamics, dialogue. wow. i cant believe how bad it was.i give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for samantha, who is a great actress, too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there.the other 1 goes to cinematography, which was indeed good.other then that my friend, this is one bad movie.i don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this, it was just horrible production. poor actors, didn't know what they were getting into...

i watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar-for-dollar, it it probably one of the worst films ever. now i am not saying it's the worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it, this is a very, very bad film.i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer/director, michael cimino. rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person. had he not been so self-indulgent, a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at harvard. the scene is huge but completely without context. you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular, john hurt) are behaving so boorishly. i find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970. this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening, who the characters are or their motivations. the next scene is 20 years later. inexplicably, the two harvard grads (hurt and kris kristofferson) are in wyoming. so, they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....well, what is john hurt in the film?!?! he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? his entire character made no sense. they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. as for kristofferson, his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable, though having him move to wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all.this brings up the worst aspect of heaven's gate. while the scenes are way too long and needed trimming, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. john hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. in fact, other than kristofferson, isabelle huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps christopher walken, everyone is completely one-dimensional. it's hard to imagine a movie this long where you don't know or understand the characters. much of the film also seems anachronistic. who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very, very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of food. maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink, the farmers could have afforded to buy food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! and what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? what did this have to do with a land war? the most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very, very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. there are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. so much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs, many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.as for the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. first, this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the d-day invasion!! second, while details of the actual events of the so-called "johnson county war" are a tad sketchy, we do know that the characters played by huppert and kristofferson never actually were there, as they'd both been hung before the battle. third, i can't believe that cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve cimino's "vision" for the film is very sad.finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. while it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. we see kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that harvard education to work for himself. we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.overall, to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a "minor tiff". well, i've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you factor in the cost of production, i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.finally, when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents. however, as no child could sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.

this is by far one the most boring movies i've ever seen! and if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself.the movie starts of slow, the storyline makes no sense at all. people fighting doesn't make any sense. i could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie (in most cases i didn't even bother) it does nothing to keep you watching the movie, the only plus point would be the cinematography. new zealand looks awesome. everything else just plain sucks.the actors try their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead.do us all a favor, even if this gets on "on demand", don't watch it!

for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards. in my opinion, the only good thing 'river queen' had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds. the story line was all over the place, samantha's character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for? it brought absolutely nothing to the story-if there was one at all!a better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected, to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes.overall, a real shame as it could have been such a good movie.

wait... wait... wait... wait... wait... wait..... what!? this movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans, only to have their hearts broken. he kills one guy, gets shot, and dies before half the movie is over, not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died...why put him on the cover if his character blows. 2. where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. it was way too confusing, i mean whats up with the girl? she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention, she failed! 4. if kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. now i am going to go watch 24..... this movie fails!

i was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation.a good movie has the audience identifying/empathising/sympathising with the main actor. unfortunately this was very hard to do with samantha morton.the storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should/could have done.keifer sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. beautiful scenery and the acting of tem morrison and cliff curtis was about the only plus.maybe by being a kiwi i set the bar higher for locally made films. maybe the change of director/ supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion.maybe i'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great.a lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special.it could have been great, it wasn't.

a good example of reversed, politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless brutes who're only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes, superior both in their appearance and abilities. apart from making the story overally dull, this also prevents the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side - it's just too simplifying. the repetitive score is incredibly annoying (as is the voice-over), the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell is that supposed to mean". photography is wonderful, though, and on the whole there's a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone don't save this movie. the dvd box uses kiefer sutherland as an eye-catcher. in fact, his character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically just an empty shell (like most non-maori characters), and disappears anyway around halfway the film. but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a kilt, that's your kind of movie...

this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time. i'm in my late 40s, and watched it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). the scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. we watched about an hour of it and turned it off. i spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie. i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; otherwise i would have given it a 1. i'm sure there are people who are really into the "art" of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? i couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a "chick flick" where the focus was on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys, with the focus on battle and adventure. in my opinion, it didn't succeed in either.

with an interesting premise (in the conflicts between europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), this should have been a good film. but the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script.yes, the natural setting is beautiful and, yes, the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. but the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again, adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over, to the soundtrack, that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and, by calling attention to themselves, take away from the story.to me, it was clear the director, with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of "danny boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio leone film, something on the order of once upon a time in the west. but given the earnestness of the story (most of leone's westerns were tongue-in-cheek), not to mention that it's no longer 1968, he succeeds in making a parody of one.too bad.

the nest is really just another 'nature run amock' horror flick that fails because of the low budget. the acting is ok, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me. the gore effects are not the best i've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way. the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs. if you liked the nest then slugs is a must-see as it's ten times better. also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called deadly eyes (aka the rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory.

worst movie ever!! its not clever or funny or thought provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script.acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing.maybe the writer/director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something (you know make a movie about nothing still cool) but failed miserably.i hope the writer never makes another movie ever!! not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever.please don't watch this movie, even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful 84 mins.

honestly, people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction. this is the level that we are dealing with here.the movie isn't bad but no way is it like "omg, the best movie since pulp fiction!". some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie variety. personally, i found my interest in the movie waned after the half-hour mark. the plot defies logic and belief. you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order "to save her husband". yeah, right. i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking, "hmm, now that doesn't make sense at all." this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief.those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their mp3 players. it absolutely killed the movie in some parts.in conclusion, watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do. i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent.

i should've realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored me.having watched several "indie" films on the strength of the reviews on here, and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers, i began wondering if it's possible i am watching completely different films from these people, or are they perhaps friends/family etc of the film makers trying to 'big up' their work? hmmm.are you interested in seeing an amateur's homage to pulp fiction and 11:14, except done with worse actors, a silly score (undermines various scenes) and unbelievable jumps in logic? if not, then skip this film.here is my open letter to two of the players in this film.alfonso morgan, please, please, please, stop trying to 'be' samuel l jackon a la pulp fiction. no-one can do what he does as well as he does.director, please come up with something original. it does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantino.simply dire, and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film. it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8.5 on this, the same as films like pulp fiction or goodfellas. it is no-where near these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, i give it a 3.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. thank god i saw it for free. i would have hated to waste my money on it.first off, there isn't a character in the movie that is in any way likable. michael caine comes close, but even he is pretty flawed. the rest of the "commandos" are made up of disgusting ex-cons. there are the two gay arabs, and three guys who try to rape a red cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no trouble sending his men off to get killed so he can escape.the "mission" is anything from suspenseful. they are to blow up a fuel dump. sounds exciting, right? well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and fixing flat tires. yes, you read that right. the "suspense" is whether they will run out of spare tires. we actually watch them change something like 12 flats on the way. that's how incredibly exciting this movie is.they get to the fuel dump to find that it is a decoy. so, nothing to blow up. and at this time, for some very convoluted reason, the british army decides that they don't need these guys anymore, and radios their whereabouts to the germans to kill them.so, now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom? nope, instead, they decide to blow up a different fuel dump, to create a diversion. but, when they get into the place, they set off a trip wire, and the germans come to get them -- calling out their names over a loudspeaker.really weird. if the germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them get all the way into the dump before springing the "trap?" instead, they wait until they get into the fuel depot, and set all of their charges. yeah. right. that would happen.so, they blow the dump, the leader sells out all of his men -- except for michael caine, since he's been offered $2000 to bring him back alive.ok... so, the men are all betrayed and killed, and michael caine and nigel davenport survive. the british troops come in with tanks, and they decide to go get rescued. since they are wearing german uniforms (they wore them to blow up the dump) they tie a white flag around a stick and walk out into the road.some british guy walks up behinds them and machine guns them to death. credits roll.yep. the two "heroes" of the movie die due to a random act of violence.it's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided: "that's a wrap. kill them off and we'll go home." i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a gracefulness of a bomb.

it's great to hear the 3 or so comments, that point out what 'footballers wives' signifies for women. the title alone, washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society, reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave . it is a post modern moronic farce. it might as well be called, 'footballers wifey who stays at home and knows her place'.on one hand, it could actually be some sort of parody on the u.k.'s, gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire. nah, that would be to ironic and clever. i also sound like i should be praising it.zoe lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously. just like an even cheaper cruella de ville. she just needs some maniacal, condescending, yet at the same time, self appraising laugh to show off her true acting range. oh she does? right. anyway, it just about sums up whom this is aimed at. either 'clever clever' journo's, who think its an up-roaring send-up of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think its 'real'. "finest actors"? omg!! stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a life.its utterly sexist and is of such low quality, that maybe those who enjoy it think they are "in" on the "joke". do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? its so demeaning to women and men. they are not all self centred, selfish, football loving materialistic jerks, who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public. it's so humiliating. i am sure ms lucker would easily stand up to them in her "real" life, and twist them round her finger as so easily done in 'footballers wives' .but of course, its doesn't really matter. i mean its only a t.v. programme after all. so please let it stay axed. it's dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that 'prisoner cell block h' was so fondly remembered for.how did it come to exist? it sure ain't subtle or complex. it could only come from the same mind set who read fhm magazine, and think its "alright" to look at soft-porn, and "do" as many women who bow to their "will" and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever "their" football team losses/wins. it's totally crass.

what was the aim here...i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim...poor acting...no action and no story..i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david beckham's $250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract. do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go.war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama...this film pales in comparison to any that i've seen before.i must say that iam truly disappointed at this film..

about 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie, i realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who're always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things, because they think it's funny and are trying to entertain everyone. this film is billed as starring traci lords, she's not that bad of an actress, but her lines aren't funny and she's not the starthe acting is some of the most god-awful i've ever seen, except for lords, the girl who plays casey, and maybe the colonel-who seems oddly out of place. i can't imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a snowboarding academy. do those even exist?the budget would've been better spent coaxing these women into doing a full length porn feature. "freddy got fingered" currently has a 3.5 score, "frostbite" has a 2.7. i'm baffled these two movies are within a 1.0 to each other, fgf is "the godfather" compared to this garbage.1/10 stars

the movie starts out with its most intelligent joke, and goes downhill from there (pun intended). after that there's lots of potty humor and sexual situations. the beautiful women were the best part of the movie. swear-word puns are not meant to be central idea jokes, but they try it here. the battle between the two groups in the local town (richies and poories) is an old tried and true setup, so how could it go wrong? well, there is no reason to envy the "richies" nor any reason to feel sorry for the poories, so we can forget the central plot. the situational humor is all toilet or sexual aimed at teenagers, but only garners giggles, no true belly-laughs.the only thing that salvages the comedy for this movie is the character humor, with the blind man providing some rehashed, but seldom used setups, and the black bar owner providing the formulaic "street" or "hood" humor. ok, forget the jokes, there has to be some killer snowboarding shots since this was a commercial enterprise. unfortunately, there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring. the rest was all "b" grade tricks or worse. the big moment, where the main character rides "the goat", a man-killer ski run, did provide one shot where a small avalanche eats the stuntman. this was the best of the boarding in this movie. any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. as for the technical aspects of the movie, the soundtrack was average, which surprises, as those snowboarding documentaries are regularly filled with quality tunes. you can catch a lot of editing mistakes and even though it was shot on a ski mountain, the majority of "scenery" shots failed to convey any sense of true size. overall, it might be worth watching if you have managed to turn your brain completely off and you like silicon breasts. even then, you wont remember a thing from this one two days later. snowboarding is still waiting for it's definitive comedy, you'd do better to watch a snowboarding documentary for sure.

ewe, the opening screams zero budget. the titles whooshing in look like my grandson was let loose with imovie. the dvd box gives the impression that you'll be treated to the old days of '80s boobie movies. nope! hardly any nudity from a flick that stars traci lords! this movie really did need the nudity too. instead you get a lot of lords perkies pointing through a shirt, however they seem to be activated by hot steam. that's odd, in my world the headlights go on in the cold.the plot is pathetic, the blind guy is just is a joke, and not a funny one. his antics are so forced and predictable. he trips over stuff and you see him bracing for the fall. he needs to work on his physical comedy.most of frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that looks like it was shot months later and inserted in to get a distributor. and the nudity is not worth it.namoibucks; it's just a matter of time before starbucks sues over that. not even funny. as billy arrives in town for the first time they come across namoi bucks, he comments "wow they have these everywhere." this leads you to believe it's a parody on starbucks, but surprise, behind the counter of this location is namoi herself. apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain decided to work in a tiny cold town.the only thing this movie has going for it is the warren miller snowboarding footage. yep this is all warren's stuff, so if you want to see great action, get a warren miller flick. leave frostbite alone.there is nothing good about this movie. there is no reason to rent it or buy it, and if a friend offers to loan you a copy for free. hit him and end the friendship.

i saw this film 2 weeks prior to going on a snowboarding holiday, so for me it was really just to get my mind in mode for my holiday. the film boasts some sweet snowboarding skills, throughout the films in the action scenes. these moments were great, a bit like watching extreme sports channel. sadly the story was quite honestly awful, the acting was generally alright, with a fairly small cast. this film is apparently comedy, at least it tries to be comical, but it seems like the comedy and the storyline was written by a teenager. the story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be anything more than a small snigger a few times during the movie. it might be worth renting just to see the snowboarding action, but then again there are plenty of movies out there that are totally devoted to snowboarding stunts and don't feature a un-funny badly written story.

while the film has one redeeming feature, namely some striking shots e.g. the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the raft, or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed influenced by the scene when the warships approach in the fantastic "fellini satyricon"), these were more photographic than cinematographic, and would have been better appreciated hung on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in a painfully slow-paced film that comes in at a whopping 162 minutes and suffers from terrible dialogue, extremely poor character development, over-acting, uninspired symbolism and heavy stylisation. this is the first film i have seen by angelopoulos, and his reputation having preceded him, i expected a lot better, but can honestly say that this is one of the worst films i've ever seen, and i won't go out of my way to watch any of the director's other work in the future. the four friends i went to see it with agree.

i can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or mr. angelopoulos. but i know greece and i love her people. in july my 14 year old son and i traveled to cappadocia, turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather iordanis lived until the great exodus of anatolian greeks in 1923. reading the summary of the film (refugees from odessa) i thought that perhaps i might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern greeks. if i did not have a home in rhodes, had i not been to greece 28 times in as many years, were i not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in greece and if i had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient, life-intoxicated people, i might have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern greece. as a professor at a new jersey state college, let me assure you that i am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film. indeed, my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power. my mother-in-law lived through the italian invasion and german occupation...barely. these characters on the screen speak greek, they listen to greek music but who are they? no, they are not even vaguely greek. of course they are not people at all but simply allegories. they are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been. all represent some aspect of post wwi greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they didn't deserve. as we joked in the late 70's in america: "the revolution didn't happen." for an ideologue/artist, this is no joke. it's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment. and it's all because the various powers (eleni's soliloquy of "guards" in different colored uniforms) didn't allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of nikos and his fellow musicians, i.e., the movement, the cause). this dark, surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century, to achieve more than any of their balkan neighbors, to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated.

had i known to what i was submitting myself, i would have fled from the theater. the film is dreadful, in the literal sense of the word. despite striking images, intriguing locales, and a subject matter that might have been fascinating, the film is dead.i was unfamiliar with this period of greek history, and prepared to experience a great film. the filmmakers's hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a train going by; we must watch it from afar, we must watch it car by car, we must see the smoke, we must see it slow down, and we must see it stop. the director's approach is didactic. likewise, the characters that he creates never develop, they never change. they are so stereotypic that we wonder, are they meant to be everyman? everygirl? everyoldmusician? is there some point to this allegory? it is the most pretentious film that i have seen in a long while.

this must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, poser films i've ever seen. what a waste of budget and actors. angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. it is clear there is virtually no plot, even if this part of greek history is material for great movies. he simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. a totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. there is no character development at all, nada, zilch. i'm usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. this is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. he even managed to make one of my favourite greek actors, giorgos armenis, seem wooden. and going to the core of angelopoulos film-making: no we're not idiots. we do not want chewed food. please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle. theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you're simply incompetent? personally, i think he tried to make a greek "underground". no matter how he tries, he can't reach kusturica.only saving grace: photography, costumes and the music.

i feel conflicted about this film - it is one of the most beautiful films i've seen, and provides insightful looks into a lost culture. there was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion playing, that brought tears to my eyes, just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today. it presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably bound up with the life of the village, another lost concept in today's world. symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated. the fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive, and a total lack of humor. i never felt like i knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving over the loss of a loved one, etc. the people were stick figures in the director's tableaux involving natural disasters, war, etc. the film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another, with no involving narrative thread and no humanity. as a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. in the end, i was too bored to finish watching it.

yes, dumb is the word for this actress. i know many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her bleached hair, lip gloss, and not so perfect body. watch her walk away in those jeans, showing a rather large butt. her butt spreads beyond her shoulders. what does that tell you? as for the leading man, played by gorgeous mark humphrey, he was perfectly cast. a charmer. however, he and lancaster just didn't match. she was out of place opposite this good looking guy. good acting by susan glover as the sister. angela galuppo had a small role and was okay. but the film's director philippe gagnon, wasted too much footage on lancaster. after a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability. and what a bitch of a wife she was. snooping on her husband, being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat. was happy to see her hit with the dart gun. i thought it might be the end of her. but alas, the script tells us otherwise. after torturing myself and watching this loser again, i still came up with the same criticism. lancaster is boring to watch. this time around her hair, folks. her hair constantly in her face, constantly tossing it back, became annoying. i question the writer, alexandra komisaruk's reason why a good looking wealthy man like philippe would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like allison. when there were so many attractive intelligent women, with class, to choose. he picks this nothing. is this the rochester/jane eyre thing? oh well, it's all a matter of taste, i guess. this sarah lancaster is not my cup of tea, folks.

i was pleasantly pleased with the ending. i just saw this movie yesterday, and was going to turn it off, but changed my mind. it was not at all the direction i thought the story would end on. thats about all positive i can say about this film. all of the actors are nobodys, especially the lead. while she is an attractive young woman, she'll never make it big. the writing, direction, and acting are wooded, sort of like what you would see on daytime soaps. the filming locations were very clever in making you think it could be anywhere, instead of blatantly tipping off it was in canada. as this was shot entirely in canada, i'm assuming the entire lot was canadien, which is not entirely bad as some recent canadien tv productions: "cold squad", "stone; underover" are quite well done.

since i am required to write minimum of 10 lines, and this garbage deserves not only a single one, i'll start with the following: 1. i voted awful for this dreadful so called "movie".2. let me explain why these turkeys mr. david varod produces are shot mainly in my beautiful homeland, bulgaria (just in btw, for the illiterate people around - this country is in europe, based north to greece and has absolutely nothing to do with mexico and uruguay) some years ago, nu image has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly direct-to-video releases. why here? because here they pay derisively low fees to the bulgarian crew and to the bulgarian actors (most of them distinguished ones) which are, in many ways, better than most of their american colleagues. personally i am ashamed of that fact. the reason is, of course, the greediness of the americans involved and their wish to get most, if not all of the profit. actually it would't be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale. there hasn't been a good picture shot here for years. at present nu image is being sued here over the very questionably purchasing of our national cinema production centre called boyana films. no doubt about it there has been corruption, there has been deceit, there has been a lies in this recent purchase. the bulgarian cinema is dead. long live the bulgarian cinema!

proof if ever more was needed, that an action movie, irregardless of its budget, can look better with more setups (or cameras), closer shots, and many more cuts. the 'martini' generation has moved on to john woo. deep fault could be better for a work over in the cutting room. ray

i know i loved this movie when i was 12-14 years old. now that i am 24 i watched it again, and i wished i hadn't. because all the things i laughed at when i was younger, is no longer funny. so this is an hour and a half without fun. for me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid, is now the things i don't like about it. besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all. the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is. and the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on... but if you are young you will probably love it. i rate this movie 4/10

writer-director emilio estevez shows a definite lack of talent here with this un-redeemable, supposed comedy. the script is completely hopeless, let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked. the comedy just does not work. when estevez isn't using poor taste sex jokes, he is borrowing used gags and re-doing them very poorly. you would think the teaming of estevez and brother charlie sheen would be cool...but...it isn't.the entire cast is uninspired and unfunny, never managing to raise a laugh, and barely coaxing a smile from their audience. do yourself a favour and leave this one on the video shelf.thursday, june 25, 1992 - video

i was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. boy, are they way off mark! to give this 9 to 10 points and call it "one of the best movies of the 1990ies" is just unjustifiable. the big problem here is lack of pace and a paper-thin plot. it's like slapstick on prozac. everything trundles along predictably and listlessly. the plot is weak to begin with -- two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour, witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy -- and the movie never manages to go much further. there are some amusing situations and decent acting, but that's not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie.it's simply a comedy that doesn't get its fat ass off the ground, so why waste your time?

this is one of those movies that i watch every time it's on not because i like it, but because it's so bad i can't take my eyes off it (like "battlefield earth" or "3000 miles to graceland"). the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance until about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position. beyond that, the jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't funny, their mishaps and missteps aren't funny...add it up, it's not a very funny movie! not even at a slapstick level! and what's with the reggae soundtrack? it's a movie about two white garbagemen and the music is all reggae. seems out of place, don't it? if you like a good trainwreck, this is for you. if you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.

this movie is bad as we all knew it would be. most times i usually love the bad 80s / early 90s trash-can comedy (haha no pun intended). i list ski school, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and many more made around this time. this even has the classic yet forgotten comedy of dean cameron (aka.. ski school section 8 instructor and party maniac for summer school). but this movie is just to slow. it takes almost 30 min to get going and we have to sit through pointless dialog between to half-wits the sheen boys (e&c). and yes i can hear the bloggers dieing to trash me with "obviously you don't watch 2 and 1/2 men). well charlie was not at the level he is now during this flick...not that he's anything worth watching now. charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and emilio isn't anymore than an overused wonder bra offering little support. actually, this movie was written by emilio and it shows. it has no real ending (come on emilio, even the ski school 2 writers barfed out an ending). no idea how any issue brought is solved, no hot babes, no swearing to lighten the bad plot, characters, acting... i'm now tired of this tirade. just save your time and watch the movies i listed above. you'll enjoy them much more.

this 'documentary' sheds absolutely no light on what it would be like to be backstage during the hard knock life tour. granted, i wasn't there, but watching this film didn't make me feel like i was. and for a film like this, that's not exactly a compliment. the whole time i watched it, all i could think was, "what are they leaving out?" when it's all over, the only rapper you feel like you have some insight into is dmx, and that's mainly because he just talks about his dogs. a waste of time.3/10

try not to see this one. i thought it was going to be good because i'm a fan of cheesy 80's films and i've enjoyed quite a bit of linnea quigley's work. i was wrong. i should have said "no" and watched gigli instead, which is probably a far better film. i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor. nothing about it was funny or even close to funny. the acting is bad, even for the queen of cheesy 80's films. there is no story, just random clips. i guess i shouldn't hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didn't have any fun and i wasn't entertained once. i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap. i'm sorry, but i don't find zombies doing aerobics funny.

so many great actors, so little worth watching. but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, i don't hold it against anyone on screen. though flawed, the book was one of grisham's only that i truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. i also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. in the movie characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so stilted. the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. but as with so much of joel schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. so preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.

regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable, i was more insulted by mcconaughey's closing statement. in a courtroom drama, the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film, and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one, the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury. this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl. i for one find this very insulting. as for the rest, i found the acting reasonable, with the exception of sandra bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self (doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one. it tells you that vigilante justice is fine, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.

this movie endorses self-justice! it grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of scat-free! despicable enough as this may be, there is also adultery in this film. the connaughey character has the hots for the bullock character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films (like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time)that make every aesthetically demanding film-goer such as me sick! i really cannot believe that someone liked this junk. it is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that i am unable to put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way. when will the american people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24/7 by films like these that turn reality into some bs where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands. this cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with america!

i have not read "a time to kill" by john grisham, and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better. but perhaps not. i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet, and if that is true, i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first work."a time to kill" is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. it wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. let's face it, those two types of films do not go together in hollywood, which is why "dead man walking" had to be made independently.the story involves a young lawyer named jake (matthew mcconaughy) out to defend a black man named carl (samuel l. jackson) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. the day before the rapists' trial, carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building, he charged out and shot both of them dead. to help out with the defense, jack accepts the help of a former law student (sandra bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary, and put in the film only for marketing purposes.meanwhile, one of the rapist's kid brother (kiefer sutherland) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot. i'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film, in addition to the courtroom scenes. what i later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.the main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. this film, however, doesn't seem to think so. besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. for example, there is an unknown character called mickey mouse, who is a member of the klan, and, for reasons unknown, is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan. after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company, and left for dead in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her---and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.and speaking of the sutherland character's reign of terror, it's amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. there's a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out, shooting one of the guards instead. now you'd think since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. no such luck. from what we could see, no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. even after bullock, was rescued by mickey mouse, she never, ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it even questioned. why was this? simple. the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense, although logically, he should have been out of the picture.besides bullock's character, there another thankless character. he is jake's assistant played by oliver platt. there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience. in my opinion, one-liners show a major weakness in "serious" films when used. it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.but enough of the film's many minor problems. what about the film's message here? it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder. we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc that caused him to kill. in desperation, jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. after describing everything that took place, he adds on one final line..."the girl is white". we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.in the very next scene, a girl comes out yelling "he's free! he's free!". wait a minute! do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? most of all, why weren't there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. i'll tell you why. they couldn't show the delibertion because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. what is the message? that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation, because in reality, there would not be an acquittal. but since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. if people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this film should be held responsible. what a socially irresponsible film this is!

first things first - though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here) downright bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on.set at an undetermined point in time (the 50s? the 70s? now?), the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that "at least we're not that bad" cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father, samuel l jackson, fearful they will get off on some technicality, guns them down in cold blood before the trial. the setting is a 'deep south' that probably never existed - the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton, the dyed-in-the-wool racists (kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman) are laughable in their villainy. the set-piece is the trial: for the defence, are the "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma, his assistant played by sandra bullock's breasts (she doesn't seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk-lawyer-who-sobers-up-to-fight-the-good-fight. for the prosecution, kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn, while in the town at large, crosses are burned, witness are intimidated and the local citizens don't seem to care some of the reviews here claim the film immoral, since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart-tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey. to be honest, objectionable though the underlying message "vigilante justice is good" might be, everything about the movie stinks: the characterizations are pitiful, the acting leaden, the direction plodding, the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody. peter menzies lush, 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative. and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours!! what's left to say? this is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone's life, it is tedious, vacuous and hammy, and, almost as an afterthought, it is morally repugnant.

there are other reviews here expressing similar views, but i still feel impelled to add my comments. the film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, apart from possibly being too long. the acting is mostly very good, although kevin spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and sandra bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy, which she admittedly manages very well.at a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism, and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. however, it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew (i haven't read the book, so i don't know how much of that is down to grisham). the biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. aside from the fact that i don't agree with that position, i don't think that such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause at all - it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. at the end the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. it's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea (and indeed he doesn't, when push comes to shove). we're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter, although if you blink you might miss it. why not take it, given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? or if he wants to make a stand in court, why plead insanity?there are less serious flaws too. the medical experts, on whose testimony the case supposedly rests, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say, and shouldn't be believed. the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and what if he had died?) i find it hard to believe that the kkk would march down the street in broad daylight. other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. and the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.my final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty - as though i must be a racist because i disagree with the resolution. it may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide, but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. the film did make me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level maybe it succeeded - but i worry that it may have re-inforced highly illiberal views in some people, which i hope is the opposite of what it intended.final thought - try watching law and order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!

a time to kill is based on john grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame. (that would be accomplished by "the firm"). that's why this movie didn't get made until much later, after grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. it had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.but it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. namely, "a time to kill" sets you up.here we have a black man (jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. we have an underdog lawyer (mcconaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. and oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in mississippi, complete with hooded kkk men burning crosses.in other words, we're supposed to sympathize with carl lee hailey. we're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. we're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. we're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting "free carl lee".but the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. carl lee hailey was a vigilante. yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent. this would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.and what's so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist. the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.this isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. as a movie, a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn't half bad. but it played the hand it had been dealt, really. even a good cast can't elevate bad source material.

this is the worst kind of film.the plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s "good boys" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? are black people universally inspiring? do the ku klux klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting "kill him"? do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the klan waiting to hear the verdict? do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands? and if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of sandra bullock? and the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? seems like the director didn't feel that strongly about sex crime after all.this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. shame on them.

normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. it is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies. and i really did my best to enjoy the movie. but i just couldn't. the jokes aren't funny enough! (i've seen my share of japanese movies. and most of the times i like and understand the humor used in those movies. "red shadow" is just silly!)the characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn't a serious movie and show that all is about the fun. look at the characters from parodies like "hot shots" or "scary movie". everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character! and because of this, certain scenes become funny and hilarious. in "red shadow" the actors never achieve that. the shadow ninja's supposed to be very skilled and deadly. sadly the actors don't do their best in convincing us of their talents. they don't do things with a straight face. the jokes would have worked better if they did! the bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me. i like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "red shadow" just fails in that department. so what is left to be enjoyed. well,the music (techno) was uplifting. it had to be as the action it self never is exciting. and there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. the use of humor,lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children. but i do wonder if children actually would like this movie. waste of time!

what can you say after watching this movie? that is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end. i was left speechless, due to the amazingly dull story, annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more iraqis, and boring dialogue. i think that if this movie has something to teach, it probably goes like "don't screw with us, or we'll come and kick your butts". plus, this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners, in the name of war. i got the image of tackling chess pieces out of the playing board. except, now it's fast and there's not so much thinking. and on top of that.. no character there has any spirit; then, how can you care at all what happens to any of them. excluding war movie fans with no taste, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. there should always be something more interesting to do.

bad sequels.....this one's a real one! when the first movie was very very bad, you have to be fool to make a sequel.....worse actors, worse scenario,worse special effects,worse movie!!! this is history! bad history! i give it 0 and a half (for laughs) out of *****.

can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie, and when he does, it is supposed to be a very emotional scene, yet when the operation delta force team kills hundreds of russians, in slow-motion action scenes, or thousands of arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you are supposed to cheer and say "take that, you non-american monsters!". i know i used "slow-motion action scenes" a lot, but that is because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, slow-motion. every last one of them... and this squad should be called "invincible slow-motion bullet-dodging force", since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets. and if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the complete non-american army that stands between them and victory. by this point, nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow-motion action scene... that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting, cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story. which is what i did... the cast is made of unknown actors, which will probably remain unknown since they don't even play characters. they are just playing guys with guns(and, lets not forget, superpowers)... the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad(although they are in slow-motion) for a tv movie... but it still sucks... and at the same time is so bad it's good... ok, maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive...25%

let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts, and i do indeed know they exist. i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this. people forget there is more than one "bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible. not everyone believes in god, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. religion does not make everything fact, one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is ok, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. none of this, "oh that was the old testament, and now we have the new testament." if the bible is the word of god, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, "is no other way." the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher. but anyhow, onto the review. i am a decent fan of "ghost hunters" and when i heard this show was coming soon, i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. as much as i like watching "ghost hunters", i do not like some of their members, and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. i am glad they are skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. if ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. it's more of a "right place at the right time" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it's going to "perform" for you? this show is kind of silly. it's usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. the main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as i believe very few of them are actually gifted. silvia brown is one i definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe.i really wanted to like this show, but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed.

this show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when it came back from commercial, the noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse) this is a pure rip-off of ghost hunters and it attempts to go "beyond" them, and fails miserably. also, what is with the directors log thing? is this star trek? it just ruins the novelty of this show, which wore off quick. the only reason it's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti-climatic nature of it. they never find anything, and most likely never will. funnily enough, they always point out something that is the thing they are "hunting" and guess what?! it's the local radio station's tower light that is blinking red!

i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes. but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots. they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it. but beyond that, the show's whole format is incredibly annoying. even though a lot of it seems scripted, the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use "big" words they obviously don't understand. and head investigator ryan's ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window. (and he looks stoned all the time). in short, this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists!

even if ryan wasn't such of an annoying person, this would still be bad, i said even if, where do we begin? "directors log" you will have the urge to snatch his tape recorder and pound it with a hammer or punt it into a lake, a haunted lake of course. oh how i wish "dead time" was more literal as opposed to what they refer to it as, but alas, no death, maybe a pillow out of place or a "humming noise" oh wait thats the cat. i actually expected to see some sort of evidence or at least something to verify their escapades, don't worry you wont see anything you that you would not see on a normal day.an entire season and what do they have to show for it, um nothing. no in fact they have less than nothing, they have a waste of time. they took my challenge, the do something for the paranormal challenge. now in this you actually do something for the paranormal, you could say go on camera and say "i love the paranormal so much i'll draw stick figures of ghosts" or " i love the paranormal so much i'll film hot co-eds pretending to be ghost hunters" you would be wasting film, but wasting it for the paranormal. or you could say "i'll mess with a demon" but don't say it's name you might get hurt, and you know god doesn't like that, that would be quite a thing for god but he wouldn't like that so don't do that. so i asked them to waste time for the paranormal and they followed suit, they went into an old building looking for "mothman", it was a waste of time, it made no real difference at all, it had no effect, we learned nothing new, it was a waste of time and film.there amazing detective work is just so uncanny, "well we found your problem" a cat died here so were going to psychically communicate with that cat and tell it to move on, kind of throw some catnip at it, and it'll be ok......directors log...." captain log star date 541.2 ...oh i mean " directors log, i just brought on a few new investigators, a couple 8's and 9's but this chic is a 10....um yeah....we have a new case... strange things happening.... .......focusing on one of the children.....were going to investigate.." now we will bring is a psychic, we haven't told them anything this is tv trust us,

i am a fan of the paranormal and i love ghost hunters so when this show first came out i decided to give it a try. i could barely sit through one episode. the show is so obviously staged. i mean come on, every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything. when i watch ghost hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence. on this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. this completely ruins their credibility unlike taps and ghost hunters who actually know what they're doing. honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch ghost hunters.

i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a&e. i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence. the production value looked good and i really love the logo. then, after about few episodes in, i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda.it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can't even make a teacup move on camera, yet everyone is terrified. then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone.also, there is very little focus on other members of the team. the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street.has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity, scaring people to convert? really, this should be on a christian network. i was very disappointed.

i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on a&e. i've been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid, and love catching "ghost hunters" when it's on (scifi channel). i've tried to watch three episodes of "paranormal state" and only use up my time commenting on it because it's so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak. "paranormal state" is beyond cheesy. cheesy "director's log" voice-overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk. cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context. everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... like in "poltergeist" you almost expect the team to leave and say "this house is clear." i very much appreciate the "ghost hunters" approach, where they go in to disprove claims, then take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring to the client (if they find anything) that haunted does not equal evil. "paranormal state" is not "so bad it's good" ... it's just plain bad. didn't a&e used to stand for "arts & entertainment"? the art part has long been gone, and the entertainment factor is now waning as well.

there really are no redeeming factors about this show. to put it simply, its just terrible. absolutely dreadful. it's just a dreadful "reality" show. not only that, it's dreadful fiction.imagine this: a bunch of overly-imaginative teenagers get together one night and go "hey! let's make a paranormal show just like "ghost hunters" and whatnot!" so they grab a camera, harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully "trying-to-be-dramatic-yet-failing-misreably" monologue. this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers. a wasted budget and terrible writers.oh, the problems, how do i count thee? well, first off, let's talk about this from a personal level. i am not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. i am willing to believe in whats paranormal and whats not, and i'm sure there are a lot of people who feel the same. so, if you're going to do a show about the paranormal, you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they're seeing is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. i hate to compare, but i don't see why not at this point. take "ghost hunters" for example. in "ghost hunters" you can tell that the cast is leveled with the audience. they're not totally skeptical, yet they're still willing to keep the possibility of any paranormal anomalies in mind. they have to look at something and be willing to say "this is possible that its simply nothing". and, with that in mind, they set out to try and prove themselves wrong. they use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with bearing the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind. not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. that element of doubt is not present in "paranormal state". strike one.in "paranormal state", the cast simply says "there's this spooky place, and its haunted, so we're going to find some spirits!" and immediately you know and saying to yourself "okay, convince me otherwise". the cast is not professional in their interviews. in fact, sometimes it seems like they're just harassing local residents of these so-called "haunted" areas. they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides assumptions and theories, and the best they can must up is somebody who "claims" they can contact the dead, with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are. they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said "pretend you can contact spirits for our show" and went at it. in the "mothman" episode, this just happens. without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show, they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random, painfully scripted "reading" of a supposed area of how something is "haunted" in order to convince its audience. very, very poor effort. i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted. during one of the episodes, the cast gets attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" at times in an attempt to be dramatic. these sort of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what they're watching is just a bunch of tabloid-esquire trash. if the show's aim was to try and convince their audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they're doing a horrifically poor job at doing so. strike two.however, there is always the counter. just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something. what if the show isn't trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction? it even fails on that level as well. if the show's creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience, the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level, it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full, horrifying glory. the writing is simply not compelling and even, dare i say, boring. strike three.so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera, a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary. thats all the show is at this point. there is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there's no reason to care about it. to be blunt, its lame. there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show.

the atmosphere in this show is great. there's plenty of excellent buildup, but thats where this show fails. there's way to much build up for nothing. you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then....nothing. over and over again nothing. you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none. they show up at these peoples doors, talk about their deep and emotional pasts, set up lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything paranormal. i laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" that we as an audience have seen nothing of. they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package. a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing...nothing!

"paranormal state" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. i enjoy watching what the "team" has to say and what they "find", however, i know that the entire show along with it's build ups and story lines are completely set up. they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses. i commonly feel as i watch it that i am not watching non-fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality. i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker. interesting show. stick to "ghost hunters"

this show, paranormal state, has an almost "blairwitch project" feel to it. as in, you're watching a 'documentary' that's actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary.my biggest problem with the show, is their 'go to' outside advisers of the warren's, who were made famous for their 'investigations' of the amityville murders, which were shown to be completely fraudulent, just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths! (such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) then there's the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything. not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. they don't want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases, that will get them the most press and attention.they're complete frauds, plain and simple.

this show is absolutely ridiculous. yes, of course its fake. but it is agonizing to watch. i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could "make" this seem real. the young lead male couldn't be more unconvincing. he line-reads everything he says. are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about? there is a plethora of ways to blair-witch this show up. fear does not breed from what seems "cool" and computer generated. nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as "what was that? did you hear that?" also, there are real convincing psychics out there that don't just "want to be on screen". another duh-factor is... how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days (if we are lucky) they film. i don't think so. a 2 + week at one site would be more convincing. it is also disarming that they think including "nasa radar checks" and computer's that show fancy bs really make us scared. and ie: exorcisms should not be staged like the film "the exorcist". when are they going to get it right? possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. they don't just snarl and lower their voice like linda blair or fallel around like courtney love on a drug binge. as stated better concentrations on "psychic ability" would aid this show greatly. we want to see and hear everything that supposingly flashes before them. not cut-away to other story bs. on a final note- shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of ufo's ahead of time. might i stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely down-right awful. avoid this show. for fright: watch old unsolved mystery episodes... not the new ones (the recreation got it oh-so wrong). but that is for a different blog.

the director has no clue. i know ... that is the obvious comment. maybe, we should delve into the story ... the relationships ... how about the quality of the actors?the story is ... well, idiotic would be a simple yet honest answer.the actors are ... they tried very hard. can they be faulted for the director's choices?all i can say is ...why was this made? well, isn't this an embarrassment to the korean-american film industry? should we be selective about who we support? am i being too harsh? check it out for yourself.

i agree that this film wasted my time and my money. the poster mislead me to thinking it was a different type of movie. i should have known given the unprofessional look of the poster. someone should sue for false advertising.

i enjoy films of various kinds and qualities. whether it's your typical standard hollywood action movie or your oscar season tear-jerker, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me.in soap girl, i received nothing but confusion. first, we meet maya, a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the customers in the parlor. a virgin poet named harry comes in one day and they fall in love. after that, there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which seem to lead nowhere.although many have commented on the controversial issue of an asian prostitute being exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was made by an asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue. but whether he succeeds or not does not matter, for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not.for me, soap girl fails to meet the standard i expect from movies. it was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie, given the loose plot and the mediocre acting. worse, it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama, when the tone falls more towards comedy.a movie such as soap girl which fails to trap me into the magic of cinema will always leave me bored. throughout the movie, i couldn't help but think, "what is this really about?" a movie has to answer that question before it is made. if not, what you'll end up with is an empty push to captivate the audience.grade: d+

from an artistic standpoint, the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution. the plot is hard to follow, if there is one at all. the acting is tough to stomach. the dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doesn't know english. only the cinematography was worth watching in this movie, although you can still see flaws in the picture.as an asian-american female, the movie angered me because it proved how narrow minded people can be. politically speaking, putting asian women in such disgraceful roles should be outlawed. perpetuating stereotypes of asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self-esteem of asian women, but also to the country as a whole. i feel for the lead actress who played maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role.as americans, please avoid this movie. art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another, not hold it back.

i recently went to a free screening of soap girl where the filmmakers were present. before the movie they strutted around, laughing, taking pictures. i was excited to see them dressed up in real life, and couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen.during the movie, the audience errupted with laughter. it was clear to me then that they weren't laughing with the picture, but at the picture. this is purely a grade b movie with no logic behind it. throw in some nudity, some blood and whala! you have a movie!after the movie i approached a bunch of the filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie. they all acted so serious, like they were serious filmmakers. they each told me something different: to make a controversial movie, a funny movie, an uplifting movie, a socially responsible movie. everybody mentioned something different. it was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making, and they were now trying to recoup their money by publicizing this movie any way they could to get people to see it.let me warn you: don't buy into the hype! unless you seriously have nothing else to do, it might be worth a film student's time to study how a film should not be made. otherwise you are better off saving two hours of your life.

"you got any beans? beans is good. you just eat them and you go." i couldn't help but laugh at that bit of dialog. beans are the musical fruit, you know. the more you eat them, the more you go toot, toot, toot.hmmmm... ok, i can understand why the actors were in this because they needed paychecks to pay their bills with, but i'm not really too sure what the intentions of the director and the writer were. even after watching the making-of documentary in the dvd extras.mike rooker gave this a performance it really didn't deserve. i've seen him in other movies much better than this one. what would have vastly improved this movie was to throw everything out, keep rooker and instead made another entry into "the substitute" franchise. rooker would have made for a terrific substitute teacher who instructs naughty and morally-impaired youth regarding the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society.casper, you really shouldn't be just pushing through the undergrowth like that as you could get poison oak. whoops. never mind. i guess poison oak is the least of your worries now. well, at least this time your croaking wasn't done by the tail of giant python. there are few things more embarrassing than being skewered through the chest by a giant snake. at least the death scene in this movie had a bit more dignity to it. as well as a more liberal smearing of karo syrup and red food dye. nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye!first time i've seen a monster wear a shiny rayon cape with a fur collar ruff. first time for everything, i guess. just to be nitpicky, though, if this was an indian ghost, how come it looked exactly like a monster out of european culture and folklore? wouldn't the monster have been more sort of more indianish?while i did watch this all the way to the end credits, i don't realistically believe that i could in good faith recommend it to others.

this may contain ***spoilers***where to start on this particular empty wasteland? well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot. acting talent, decent dialog, suspense, humor, hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick. unfortunately there was only a lot of gore, (even that wasn't done well), shooting automatic weapons and missing.there seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise, a native american cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, with his being tracked down by a federal special ops team who dressed in civvies(?). most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie, separating from the group so you can be picked off one by one. you'd think this team would know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappearing without a trace. when they finally realize they're being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot. tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money.when they're not shooting trees they're tracking this spirit who leaves no trail, (who knows how they're tracking it), and spouting a lot of macho bs. by the way, did i mention that most of this team are women? interesting listening to them talk tough. not very entertaining, but interesting.all in all, you can find better movies in the bargain bin at kmart.

was this supposed to be a comedy? the black cape and skeleton mask are hilarious. there is like zero plot. the movie starts out with an archaeologist and his assistant. they make a small mention of their dig site being cursed. and then, lo and behold......in drops halloween costume man, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask face, holding an axe. so, he kills off these two people. then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of predator, only the commandos are being hunted down by halloween costume man who is now riding a horse! more commandos show up, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a hiking group. yeah, production probably ran out of commando costumes. can you say, low budget? anyway, they come upon a lone old indian guy sitting in the woods. he's just too funny. and he starts babbling about something, but you really don't know what he's mumbling about, so they flashback to some indians getting killed. none of it really makes sense. and then we go back to our commandos where more of them get killed. and that's really basically the plot. it's so laughably bad, you just can't really look away because you want to see just how low it sinks. you could make the same movie with a camcorder, a halloween costume and a bunch of your friends with fake guns. don't see this thing if you want a horror movie. if you want a comedy, maybe? or just skip it and get something like the real predator.

a delta force army unit, assigned to find a batch of missing green beret bad-asses not known for going completely missing, will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an ancient indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave. the skeleton man rides a horse and has the ability to propel to and fro using a type of dimensional portal, and seems unaffected by bullet-fire and explosives. the skeleton man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride from behind and around his prey silently. the film's point-of-view through the skeleton man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color. in other words, he's not seemingly human, so how can captain leary(michael rooker, as grizzled and intense as ever)and his gang of would-be commandos stop this menace? for some reason, the skeleton man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant. what are the skeleton man's motives for slaughtering endless human beings? and, why is a blind indian living in the forest our commandos inhabit spared if the skeleton man, as a human, slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself? as completely stupid as it sounds. just unbelievable horrible. this is the kind of film that can deaden brain cells. casper van dien gets second billing in the credits just under rooker, yet is saddled with a ridiculously underwritten character who exits the film quite early. rooker deserves better than this. if i were an actor, i wouldn't want this movie in my resume. the skeleton man is a reject templer knight from a de ossorio film. he has a spear which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact. an arrow shot from the skeleton man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane. for nearly 99 % of the film, bullets are shot at the skeleton man and he can go in and out of that portal thingee yet, at the end, all of a sudden, he becomes vulnerable to attack. oh, and the horses also change as the skeleton man freely moves through the forest from that portal.the film is written and edited by clowns. the attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced pros, make really bad decisions throughout this film. the mind boggles with this film. good for some laughs, and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie.

i saw this on sci fi, and in retrospect, i'm not sure how i actually managed to watch it all the way through. this is utter trash. it's not a b movie, it's a "d movie" at best.basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse (and sometimes not on one) goes killing everything in it's path somewhere in the mid west of america. a load of people are missing (infact murdered) and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them. the best part of this movie, i'll tell it now, is there's some really cute girls. let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off, slashed apart, or hit so hard with a mêlée weapon that the head explodes off. that's no spoiler... the gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque. it serves no real purpose, either.here's what's good: the sets look ok, the actors sometimes act ok, the outfits and props, some of them, are decent.everything else that you can think of, sucks. a lot of the badness is in the editing. some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene. sometimes the characters do non-understandable things, and they're always splitting up, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that they're splitting up all the time and are ok with it even tho they're in a really dangerous situation and there's bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left. nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and i don't really get how this immortal, indestructible bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end, and frankly, i don't care. too much stupid, hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and i don't really care to list it all here. and they're all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when it's almost laughably bad... just awful.this movie is a complete waste of time. there's no excuse for watching this, unless the only channel you happen to receive is scifi and you're bound to a chair in front of the tv. but if you're not bound, you're better off doing a crossword, throwing a frisbee, or even just thinking. there's lots of much better b movies that you can watch.my senior year in high school my friend and i, in visual communication and deign class, made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie (there was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere. it was better work than this movie. that really says something about this and i'm puzzled and troubled as to why sci fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can show.the only movie that i've ever endured that was worse than this is raptor island (another brilliant scifi work)-though it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie- but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of worst movies i've ever seen.

a whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused, obviously. the original title of "cottonmouth joe" would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience. i have personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender) and it is indeed a lot like the movie skeleton man -- a dry, scummy film that provokes regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower.it is unfortunate that the choice of "skeleton man" for the title was finalized by the distributor (probably the work of some meddling hollywood no nothing studio exec who just didn't get it) and not "cottonmouth joe." those of us who have seen the film know that the skeleton man is actually cottonmouth joe (a skeletal-manish apparition, not a true skeleton man). the deception of the folks marketing this film is unforgivable, and for that alone, i cannot give this film a high rating. imagine this: when future filmmakers get together to create the true definitive skeleton man movie and need a title, they will be totally screwed and we are all, as serious fans of the genre, diminished for that.cottonmouth joe could've become a horror movie icon right up there alongside madman marz, black claw, mansquito, humongous, "nature boy" billy conners, morty the wooden doll, the boogen, eegah, the moon beast, bloody bill, the driller killer, mickey rooney, and so forth, but he will always be remembered as a sword wielding-caped-tackle dummy skull face-tied to the side of a horse-skeleton man wannabe.that's too bad.

as a helpful warning for others, i believe "skeleton man" is actually worse than "raptor island." i have been using ri as an example of the worst original movie presented on the sci-fi channel, but sm is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie i have yet seen. yes, i did watch almost the whole thing, coming into it about 35 minutes into it. it drew me in with its pure ineptitude. what was sci-fi thinking? once skeleton man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was--i'm not good on military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing. i had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole.

i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear! this movie is awful! beyond awful... in fact, so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is "skeleton man". in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible. sure, loads of people are getting killed by this skeleton-puppet wearing a ridiculous cape, but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is, where he comes from or why he's so angry with the world. he looks like a crossover between skeletor from "masters of the universe" and the horseman from "sleepy hollow" and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness. the setting of "skeleton man" is another totally retarded aspect! for nearly half an hour, i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island, but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods! huh? why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes? anyway, after a couple of totally random killings, a special commando squad, led by poor washed-up michael rooker, arrives to come and hunt a monster they don't know anything about. really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him/herself as the expert in a certain field (we have a sniper-specialist, a tracking genius, a drill instructor...), yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills! the horror gods must really hate casper van dien, as he's present again as well, portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there. right, that makes sense... furthermore the characters steal cool one-liners from "predator", the bonehead's horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are brought down with bow& arrows, ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael rooker. i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top 100 asap!

the scientist charles and his wife (or assistant) marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being, the skeleton man. then, a military squad commanded by captain leary (michael rooker) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle. they face the skeleton man, shooting him while he kills each soldier. then the skeleton man goes to a power plant, and captain leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being.i bought "skeleton man" on dvd expecting to see a funny trash, but i found an awfully boring, annoying and senseless crap, with shoots and explosions. the imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense, and the military team is composed of imbeciles, insisting in shooting the supernatural skeleton man until they are totally slaughtered. their leader is also the most stupid, with the blow-up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the extraterrestrial warrior predator. on dvd, it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. my vote is two.title (brazil): "skeleton man"

as i write this, no user reviews are in yet, but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. i didn't notice any, and even if i had i don't think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them.a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment. i tend to fall into the "yes, that's a reasonable reaction" camp -- especially when the mistakes are central to the plot. with this movie, i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of b movies, that is.) in short, i can't think of any non-trivial thing they got right.any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, able to disappear into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (they don't make ghosts like they used to.) combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.

this ranks up there as the worst movies of all time. no research or thought at all went into this movie. action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie. items appeared and disappeared at random, etc. it's obvious that this was directed by a "stunt coordinator", who should go back to his old job. the skeleton man rode a horse throughout the movie, which amazingly, could change color at will. either that, or someone thought the audience would all be colorblind and not notice. blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next, miraculously disappear and then reappear. seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies.

although casper van dien and michael rooker are generally relegated to b movies, even they are above this movie. it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear, or dread -- unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage. the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks. and what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. i liked him better when he was fighting he-man. this is one of the laziest jobs of character design i've ever seen. i mean, it's skeletor! and he's on a horse! this is supposed to be some scary, supernatural creature? how are we supposed to take this seriously? all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse -- which he can barely stay on -- interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods, thinking they can shoot a ghost. occasionally, skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone, revealing how corny the effects really are. i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level, but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment. where's dolph lundgren when you need him???

if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women, there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film. if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed "action" scenes, there are plenty. if you are both blind and deaf, i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence. it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen. and it does appear that there was some money spent on it. talk about throwing money away! as an editor, i would hope that the "editor(s?)" of this "movie" never again be allowed to edit a film, book, or even a post-it note. as a writer, i would hope that the author(s?) never again be allowed near even a broken crayon. you would think that i am not recommending that you view this movie. not so. tape it (so you may stop your pain when you need to) and educate yourself as to how bad a movie can be.

my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies. some movies are so bad they are good. mansquito was one of those. that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities. it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like "hey! mansquito!"this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad. it isn't just a bad movie, it really stinks. there was the coed strike force, the "indian" that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud. he shot down a helicopter with an arrow!! we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didn't rise above pitiful. we couldn't come up with any redeeming features except for one. those were the words "the end"there seemed to be no plot, no character development, and no point to the movie. someone in hollywood needs to be fired.

to be honest, the movie was so horrible that i loved it. never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie. i was in shock. i mean, i don't even know what to say.the characters couldn't even keep their own guns, one minute a guy had an m16 and his friend had an mp5, then in the next scene they switched guns. (don't ask, trust me i know my guns)and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam, to an arizona highway, to my backyard, and then to a chemical plant in california, that is what i took from it.why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you? how is that frightening? i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie. i love how the "skeleton man" randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day. but hey, whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants.good day.

thank god for dvr and the high speed of it's fast forward. even with that i couldn't sit through any more of that travesty. when they came across the old indian asking for beans i gave up and erased it. is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights? how about some old classics instead? the idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough. it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods. what more can i say? it was so awful that i don't think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it. but, it looks like one more line will do it. save your time, let alone your money on this dog of a film.

a group of people goes deep into the jungle for various reasons, and finally find a lost city (where apparently king solomon's diamonds are) and a race of super-gorilla's... now, you know you're in trouble when you put fine actors like linney and curry in one movie that stars... a talking gorilla, and that is just the beginning. okay, what else...?for an action/adventure movie the film is... well, lacking just that. the first hour (!) of the movie they aren't even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with subplot after subplot (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do... it's just no fun anymore.the effects of the movie are only so-and-so (and really bad compared to the earlier jurassic park movie).now, the ending... the father not caring for the death of his son, but just interested in the diamonds? uh-huh... only in the movies folks, only in the movies.a complete waste of talent, this chricton (jurassic park, twister, er) adaptation. 2/10.

as an avid cinema go-er i felt that whilst i was ranking my favourite movies i felt it only fair to rank my most hated films.i'm afraid i really have nothing positive to say about this movie. it is in fact one of only two films that i have ever walked out on. in fairness i went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and sat through it only to wish that i should have stayed away.the sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crew...but then even the brightest stars in hollywood cant bring a dead duck of a script to life.stay away...save yourself from this truly woeful 'film' 1/10

what a lousy movie, took me 3 times to finish it. the thing i disliked the most was the infantile sense of humor. jokes made by a 10 years old child. not funny. pretty annoying actually, for example when the detective cant get a place at the bar he yells "she's taking it all off" and then they all run "fast foreward" slapstick kinda' rush. so stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar smashing fruit to work out his post traumatic stress disorder. on the bar! and the bartender is supplying him with more and more fresh fruit. thats supposed to be funny? and i mean ... i love good ol' exploitation gore flicks, and saw a lot of terrible movies, but his one is plain bad. and also the "gore" is not that exciting. don't bother. i wouldn't recommend it.

some might remember if having seen the film juno a scene where ellen page has a moment of praise for dario argento's suspiria, her favorite horror film. jason bateman's character then asks if she's ever seen a herschel gordon lewis film, and to wit he has a copy of a movie (i forget which at the moment) and shows it to her. at the time i saw juno i had seen suspiria and a few argento films but not lewis. now i can see that it's not just another one of diablo cody's pop-culture "in" references, but something that actually is an indicator on the tastes of the characters and, maybe more subjectively, how to judge them based on their tastes. in other words, herschel gordon lewis's reputation is maintained some many years after he ended making his gore films - and it's that of a schlock-meister, no more no less. actually, less.it's interesting then to take argento as a basis of comparison, because both filmmakers approach, at least in the case of the gore gore girls and, well, any given argento picture, similar material. where argento is extraordinarily conscious about his craft, getting an audience wrapped up in whatever little story there is by the power of the movement of camera and music and style, lewis takes the easy route to get at an audience, which is with an immature script and (putting it lightly) lackluster direction. the gore gore girls reveals a filmmaker who isn't interested in entertaining his audience in an actual compelling way as a horror film, but as a side-show or a brothel. he can't direct actors worth a damn, he lights like it's a porno movie, and for every one possibly clever or funny one-liner there's ten that either totally stink or are too clever by half or not clever nearly enough.that being said, perhaps as the best substantive thing to say about the gore gore girls, a mystery movie about a detective (2nd rate sherlock holmes guy played by somewhat amusing frank kress) and a newspaper reporter (dummie amy farrell) investigating a series of murders of go-go dancers, is that it serves as the template for countless more troma-style pictures. perhaps this is faint praise, however, and really the best thing that can truly be said is that henny youngman- "take my wife, please!"- has a few scenes and steals every one of them without having to try much. it's sad, since it could be the kind of picture that could entertain on an awesomely-bad level. but even on that score one may laugh more out of embarrassment for the production, some of the actors (i.e. that guy who plays the cop, my god) than out of some guilty pleasure enjoyment.even the gore itself is somewhat of a letdown. at first one thinks that lewis is at least delivering on this end, showing these women being murdered in crazy and vicious and exaggerated ways. but with the killings it all goes on longer than necessary; i don't mean this in terms of shock value, for that it's fine. but there needs to be something else to really make it "stick", that showing women's faces dissected and eyes gouged is fine if you're 12 and seeing this as one of you're first 'horror' films. it becomes, dare i say it, dull. dangerously dull for such a "daring" so-called movie.this was lewis's last film until 30 years later an apparently worthy swan song came with a sequel to a film he made earlier brought him out of his retirement from movies and job in writing books on how to make it in business. however, whatever experience he had coming up to this one doesn't show. it's not a failure, but it could have been, and it's just simply... schlock. take it or leave it.

i won't say the show is all bad, because there are some funny parts, like spencer, and a few random incidents. but other than that, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom that kids are buying into.miranda cosgrove was cute and funny as megan on drake and josh. honestly, she is mediocre in icarly and is just not as funny as she tries to be. the actress who plays sam seems to be half-asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clichéd that i would think of them. they're not funny, just annoying. and freddie is okay, but not that interesting.of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. some are bothersome, though. here are a few: 1. the girls are 14, and have a web show that gives away too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000(wtf), with little to no advertising, and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people 2.their web show gets too much praise ($100,000 yearly to advertise sneakers, a free trip to japan, plain white ts performance, and so on). honestly, anyone over the age of 6 would not find their "comedy" entertaining.3. how is it that they are so "average", yet they own a three story loft, spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxuries, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. all of the adults are idiots. all of them.5. no 5 foot high girl, no matter how obnoxious and tenacious, can take down trained cops, unless she's muscular. sam is skinny and petite.6. no one can fall down 9 stories in an elevator and live.7. kids can handle finding out about criminals better than cops.the show is stupid. really, it seems harmless, but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders, live alone in seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible moron, and give out personal information is just wrong.i'm disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. what happened to the cartoons when i was her age?

return to frogtown was a hard film to track down. well, i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while. wish it was kept that way! first, sam hell is of course not roddy piper. he is replaced by a dude with a large face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft-spoken for the part! sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. here, he gets captured three times! what kind of a hero is that?! spangle is replaced as well here by another actress. why did we not get different characters here? this was stupid! lou ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero. common sense says let lou be the hero of the film! bad effects, poor acting, and just a forgettable film. funny as they take shots at ninja turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. at least ninja turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! i really wanted to like return to frogtown, but i just cringed when the fight scenes would commence. this film makes turtles 3 look like gold! avoid this or you will be the one singing "meaner, greener, talking turtle tv dinner!"

the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like "miner's massacre" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and a couple of embarrassing performances. somebody forgot to tell the writers that "fool's gold" refers to the genuineness of the gold, not the people who are looking for it. 3/10

director and fx man john carl buechler doesn't have to do much in order to terrify me; the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart.his lamentable straight-to-video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop; twenty years later, and his dvds occupy the same space. it seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. you can rely on old jcb to serve up dreck, whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie-making technology.in this contemptible offering, a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of jeremiah stone, aka the forty-nineran evil, claim-jumping, cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid-1800s. before his death, jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold, and it's not long before the pick-axe wielding killer is back, bumping off the hapless treasure seekers.with its dreadful script, unimpressive make-up effects and scooby-doo style villain, 'the curse of the forty-niner' is par for the course for buechler. only genre stalwarts keren black, richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever, with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful (although i'll forgive alexandra ford, who is a complete hottie).even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on, and a lot of the deaths occur off-screen (which is probably not such a bad thing since the on-screen deaths are pathetic).'the curse of the forty-niner' is another in a long list of duds for john carl.

this was bad enough. i really hope that there is no sequel. maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility, but no, it really isn't.there is really not at all special about this movie. well, the special effect were fairly good, but nothing to write home about.there were some hot babes in her, especially elina madison and alexandra ford, but nothing to see folks. pg-13, definitely not an r. that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual.tame scare fare.

a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of suttersville. despite warnings by the local sheriff, murphy(john phillip law), old man prichard(richard lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible wanted posters, and kooky superstitious aunt nelly(karen black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(jeff conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. finding the gold of jeremiah stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. but, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. jeremiah stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. this hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. another failed attempt to retreat has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. aunt nelly informs those still alive about the forty-niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. will anybody survive? or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?make-up effects artist and monster creator, john carl buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. he provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, karen black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. the story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the suttersville authorities warn against such an action. startling enough, stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan. retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. they are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. what is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. the ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. one thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. at least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. martin cove has a minor cameo as black's former husband, caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. vernon wells(..of the road warrior and commando fame)has the back story role of jeremiah stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially elina madison as easy-lay roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, hayden(rick majeske). stephen wastell(the ghosts of edendale) is axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his "dump in the woods" scene and current unemployment status.

seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible. after the credits i thought: "hey with this cast it'll probably be pretty good". didn't at all turn out that way. lame predictable groaners, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except a little ms. lara's) and an ending one could foresee 10 minutes into the movie. and worst of all, it misused a delicate theme (handicapped persons) for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue. the handicapped person the film sympathises with the most is the one who is just faking it. what kind of message is that? and the film doesn't have a thought through ending at all, it basically comes down to: "i love you, doesn't matter that you acted like a prick."to sum it up: great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick.

alexandra maria lara: a very beautiful and enticing woman, but not a good actress. in all the films i've seen her in, she appears to me as the exact same character. whether it be in the downfall, nackt, vom suchen und finden der liebe and now wo ist fred! she always is (plays?) the young, good-hearted woman, who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle the things happening to her. she disposes of a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly. i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isn't in here. so she's typecast as the nice girl next door, which she is, but, once again, she ain't up to snuff when it comes to acting. til schweiger: same thing! the film: downright stupid. as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i don't like either. i wasn't offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it, i just thought that the jokes resulting from this weren't funny at all. i chuckled twice or three times but when i was halfway through it, i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end.

be very afraid of anyone who likes this film. they probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child. its so awful i refuse to relive a plot. o yeah, there wasn't one! this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre. do the bad guys win? do the good guys win? who cares!

this movie is absolutely terrible... definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies.the special effects are 'a-team'-standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood.of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-die evil americans'.unless braindead movies are you game, don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. pick up 'the platoon' or 'apocalypse now' instead.

this movie made my face hurt. i don't understand it...things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number. i don't understand how people can laud this film with praise. there are b-movies, and then there are b-musicals, and then there is rockula.the songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video, which eases the pain, yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist. the most frightening section of the film is toni basil's creep-dance that accompanies her weird song. but on the bright side, she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for, unlike pop music sensations rockula (aka rapula) and mona...wow, can we say tone deaf. so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, see this film. if you hate your life, then buy it.

if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love bug' was daft, wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel. dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally; this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race, a lancia driven by julie sommars. by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'herbie rides again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast's frantic mugging.

even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease, after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968, the house of mouse cashed in with herbie rides again, herbie goes to monte carlo, and herbie goes bananas. neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of the love bug back in 68, in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick wheely applegate, entering herbie in the monte carlo rally. naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and herbie falls in love with another car!. the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. still you get to see herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4/10.

in the last few years of ron miller's (son-in-law of walt disney cum producer) reign he churned out live-action crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones, whose entire career was based on that kind of light, empty-headed fare. other horrible films from that same period include pete's dragon, the last flight of noah's ark, unidentified flying oddball and the dreaded condorman. i'll not mention tron because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it, so he had little to do with the actual production. however he was in full force when this god-awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity. herbie goes to monte carlo. second sequel to much- loved love bug tale finds herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. there's a race, some lame bad guys, a diamond and barney fife. shot in france, the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely. but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france. the rest of film is a wreck. prat falls, bumbling thieves, wicked german racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. the biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop herbie's lover personality via shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old, disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little vw. then again i would think it'd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing.

sadly, this movie did have potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud, as it did here. also, i don't think i've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh, but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery. the last time i was this stunned at how un-funny a comedy can be was with the awful "big momma's house." scene after scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly. silly and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer. an absolute, rock-bottom dud.

if a movie has an unimaginative, hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really, really funny. you can get away with a lot if you're funny. but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in grandma's boy, they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance.the movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone. when alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does. the movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them.the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. the game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy. but don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games.the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of j.p. j.p. is i think more-or-less conspired by the creator of doom, john carmack. at least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games.in the movie, j.p. is a weird, obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers. that makes no sense at all. if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as j.p. is supposed to be) then even if you're quirky and obnoxious, people will still admire and respect you on some level. if stephen hawking is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make jun of him to his face.also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as j.p., but in the movie they are basically frat boys. it's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie. and while that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a game company. if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one. unless you're a hack.about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up. something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. and i realized i hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. so i stopped (although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clichés, which they did).normally if a movie's bad i just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe.shame on the movie for luring a good actress like linda cardellini into it, then surrounding her with talentless nobodies. i'll give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the anti-shirley partridge though.

i can laugh at just about anything, but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb!!!!i honestly watched this movie from beginning to end, and did not even crack a smile. i am shocked that sandler, schneider, spade etc., would put their names on this piece of crap. worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players. what more can i say? how could such tasteless, extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent!! maybe i have lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time. what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back.

i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler "happy madison" production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. i realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. the acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. overall i was very unimpressed with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it.

this movie has no plot. it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big pot party at grandma's house. the climax of the movie didn't even relate to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end. i can see how it could have related to the supposed story - that grandma's vg skills redeem him - but that just wasn't there. however, the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes. "her pussy smells like the great depression" "he just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours" "it's for you...i think it's the devil"

alright, how someone can actually think this movie is awesome, is so beyond me... i can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character it has going for it, is the evil super nerd game designer, and that gets old after a while. this movie is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny they're forced, you see better acting at the red light district, and the story sucks it's so predictable, you know exactly what's going to happen. even the characters do not react like they should, try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're banging 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time, her response wouldn't be (smile) "ok let's get back to work". i didn't laugh once during this movie, and i wish i had never seen it or spent 3$ to rent it because that's not even worth it. adam sandler produced this movie, i have lost all respect for him. all his movies are the same, his comedy style got old ever since the waterboy came out, if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented it...there's no way i would have wasted my time on it. this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect... ace ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie, it didn't have a killer plot...but it was original and it was hilarious. i'm not knocking the movie because it has 'low-level' humor, i'm knocking it because it sucks, it's a piece of hollywood crap. if this movie was presented to a production company and din't have "adam sandler" behind it, it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom. if you want a good movie about pot-culture watch cheech and chong, or whitecastle. if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14-17 year olds, with loud rock music at every possible cut, acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn, and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. don't do it.... for the love of god...this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind it.....hercules in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen, but it's actually so bad it's good. this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much, if not more.

first of all, i'd like to say that i really enjoyed this movie. however, that said, i can't say that it was a "good" movie. i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations (something i've learned to do). i'm glad i did, because the plot and development wasn't stellar. the jokes were low-grade humor. but, i was in the right mindset to enjoy them.i wasn't the only one. in fact, the entire theatre was laughing out loud. i didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close. i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing! but again, i have to warn you, grandma's boy is not a top-quality film. it is a funny (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. oh, and don't take kids to it.

call me old fashioned, but i like movies with plots. i thought "stoner comedy" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high. "grandma's boy," however, has decided this is a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached. apparently, allen covert (star and producer) and the happy madison gang were right, but that doesn't make "grandma's boy" any less boring and unfunny. they might be completely stoned -- but the characters are mostly half-baked.alex (covert, a longtime supporting player for adam sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted. he could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. after trying a couple friends, he ends up living with good ole grandma lilly (doris roberts of "everybody loves raymond"). she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline.like most people, alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both. his friends/co-workers all do the same thing. most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games. they're all awkward and all with the exception of nick swardson and joel moore (only at times) their characters aren't funny. funny if you're blazed ... sure, i suppose, but i can't say from experience.maybe all we loser guys like is getting high, playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film. neither should old women getting high on accident (saw that one coming) or being the but of gross-out sex jokes -- but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything. no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot, alex trying to get the hot girl (linda cardellini) to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline.characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but aside from a lovable doris roberts, the aforementioned swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moore's skill at making robot noises, there's little character ingenuity. covert is a run-of-the-mill main character with no comedic dimensions, his dealer friend dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and jonah hill and kevin nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter.if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness, "grandma's boy" will likely be just what you're looking for. those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected. the most i can say for "grandma's boy" is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness. it won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half.~steven cvisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com

there's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, don't take it seriously. chillax dude!!! well that's one point of view. the other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these "comedies".what you get is a slacker who, through some totally unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always a he), overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you won't believe it maaann. this guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. then he shines his shoes with it". hilarious.most of the usual names turn up. david spade and rob schneider do unfunny shtick but they're crrrazzeee characters - a russian and, i'm holding my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. adam sandler, the king of the brainless unfunny, illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called dante shows up, yet again. the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy dante is famous for cos we are clueless. allen covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. he was 42 and looked years older.did i laugh? yes, but no more than i would at a tv sit-com and i don't have to pay a penny to watch them. please stop making these movies.

positively ridiculous film.if doris roberts, shirley jones and shirley knight persist in these kinds of films, they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full-time.while the idea that a 35 year old swinger, who works on video games, loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight, this is foolishly dealt with. imagine the 3 bags getting high on stuff that grandson alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson!the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film. the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others.terrible best describes this miserable film.

what could be expected from any adam sandler-produced comedy, grandma's boy is predictable and so dumb it is sickening. allen covert stars as alex in the film, a 35 year old pothead who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandma and her two roommates after losing his apartment. some usual plot turns occur: he has trouble adjusting to his new living situation, which in turn makes him have trouble at work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the office's new consultants. throw a weird boss, almost alien company star, really nerdy best friend, a few scenes at burnt-out pot dealer's place, a really big party scene, and an original video game alex is trying to finish by himself into the mix you have grandma's boy in its entirety. allen covert does make a marginally good lead, linda cardellini is cute enough for her role as the just-one-of-the-nerds office consultant samantha, and a few scenes do manage to squirt out a chuckle or two but none of that makes grandma's boy worth much of anyone's time. most of the supposed funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them are nothing but "humor" that would make anyone at national lampoons embarrassed to watch, joel moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video game mastermind j.p., and the entire film actually manages to be boring on top of not funny or substantial. well, at least grandma's boy did something for someone: adam sandler was able to get a few paychecks to his out-of-work friends david spade, kevin nealon, and rob schneider.

honestly, this may be the worst movie i've ever seen. and i've seen spider baby, and not of this earth. heck i've even seen 200 motels. having just discovered the freaks and geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda cardellini i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try. that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb. i didn't realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio. this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state. seriously. watch this movie if you think will farrel is really really really funny, if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius. watch this movie but please don't breed!

creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. it either works, or it does not. grandma's boy is one of those movies that does not work. it may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films (sans sandler himself, he's just a producer).alex (allen covert) is a game tester. he's 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid-filled workplace. he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just been spending the rent money on philipino hookers and not paying the landlord). desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, lilly (doris roberts of everybody loves raymond) and her two roommates.that's the basic plot of the film, thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha (linda cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as velma in scooby doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can, a robot-like game creating prodigy j.p. (joel moore) who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix, and of course, all sorts of sex and drug related jokes. that's it.the problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it just is not funny. it is totally mind-numbingly boring, and only sparingly funny. nothing really happens at all. no emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense swearing. you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, wishing you had not even bothered with the film. how this film was greenlit and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me.there's just no entertainment value to come from it. none of the actors are actually putting in good performances, they are just acting like idiots for the camera, and hoping for the best. stoner comedy has been done before multiple times, and on occasion, actually works (harold and kumar go to white castle and dazed and confused come to mind). here, it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already. the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either.other than a few funny one-liners, this movie should just be out-right missed altogether. it's not very funny, the entire plot is silly, it's boring, and it just makes for one horrendous film. avoid it like the plague.1.5/10.

this movie is on the level with "welcome home roxy carmichael" for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. if these guys weren't adam sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. i hate this movie, it makes me want to injure people. i will admit that i have high standards, but honestly i'd rather watch step up 2. the ultra sad part was when i logged onto imdb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. this is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. after seeing this rating, i would like to suggest "tyler perry's house of pain" to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination.

it's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film. the story is predictable when not completely laughable. it's all a matter of "dutiful gestures" which, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. yes, the mgm "production values" are gorgeous, and yes, ms. lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective... it's my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released; the passage of time has not improved it.

i fully agree with the previous reviewer. there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. hedy lamarr isn't at her best, and spencer tracy appears to be naive, simple and overly-hopeful -- both in love and life; an idealist role that played out best in 'boys town'. if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station...whoa...it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast. not the best acting on anybody's part. miscast and mismatched. story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent. hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself, which is truly the best part of the film. spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason.

hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress, is again the kept mistress of kent taylor, society playboy and general all around rat. on a boat from the yucatan after taylor's given her the brush she tries suicide. but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean.tracy's quite the all around medical fellow. i guess he never heard the word specialist. he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research. lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern. of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens.watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracy's oscar winning boys town. unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker ain't a patch on what he did as father flanagan. maybe they were trying to give father flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak.tracy and lamarr did not get along too well. in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film, presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did. she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions. and a whole new supporting cast was brought in.fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them.

i adore hedy lamarr. i think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s. she was the nastassja kinski of that era, and critics didn't take her seriously. having said all that...this film is a bore. when i watched it for the first time, i was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in story, but in makeup and costumes. hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. so does hair length and style. reason: this thing had so many writers and underwent so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all. her "lady of the tropics" began filming after this one began, yet it was released before "i take this woman." in fact, at the time, it was known in hollywood as "i re-take this woman." that should tell you something. i'm a spencer tracy fan as well, but he is awful here. i've read in various film histories that he absolutely despised hedy lamarr, and that looks perfectly obvious on film. no chemisty whatsoever. the story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely. i can't recommend this one at all.

i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are exchanged among various rental outlets. 'the man who skied down everest'. hmm... never heard about it. the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to ski down everest and actually did it. sounds interesting. i rented it. as expected it was documentary style. the first part can be summarized so: "i always wanted to ski down mount everest". this is followed by some footage of preparation for the event. lots of preparation footage. ok, i suppose it takes a lot of preparation. then we are treated to a protracted piece on the skier, yuichiro miura's philosophy on life etc. more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the skiing fits in to this show. more preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain. more philosophy is shown. at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin' thing. lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow miuras' speed on the steep slope. finally he straps on the skis and gets ready to go.he's off... he skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot out from under him, he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and that's that. end of story. what the heck was that?ok i can buy that he always wanted to ski down everest, made extensive preparations and actually tried it with camera crew in tow. it didn't work and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself, so what egregious hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it skiing down everest? perhaps the title,"the man who's feet shot out from under him and he slid on his ass down everest" was just too long for the tape box.

i saw this film when it came out. let me see now--this guy who had earlier skied down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act---to ski down the world's highest peak. well--and here comes the spoiler--what happens, see, after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top--and a life is lost in the bargain--he gets on his skis, manages to make it down a very very short way, at which point his parachute opens...and that's that. and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got. another spoiler--oh yes, one of the sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse. the narrator, who is quoting the "daredevil skier, casually remarks that, according to the sherpa religion, since this man's body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest. is it worth it, the narrator muses. yes he answers--because it served the purpose of letting this clown "ski down everest." i can't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid. this is one to miss at all costs.

if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of mount everest, then you may enjoy this movie. just skip ahead to the views of the mountain.(spoiler alert) however, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 sherpas and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down mount everest.the question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives, and he answers an emphatic "yes".the part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. he skis for a short time, then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow.

i'm a huge lover of really bad b movies. and i especially love alien/scifi movies. i say the cheaper, cheesier, and campier the better. a low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad b movies, but this movie is so bad that i really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad-lib actors. first off, there's no real plot, it's all sort of situation "comedy" (if it can be called that). the "comedy" in this movie is more about characters saying, in essence, "look at me, i'm in this crazy situation! isn't this funny?", but it's only pathetic because nothing anyone's doing is that funny. there's no comedic acting skill, nor any kooky plot to carry all the very un-imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd.the bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad ad-lib acting, actors saying really stupid things over and over again (perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases, perhaps just b/c everyone in this is so bad), really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks, and people barfing and passing out in bathrooms.there was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who i could tell had some acting chops and was kinda' convincing in his role. he was as out of place as a solid bm in a weekend detox unit's bathroom. corey feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (thankfully we didn't have to put up with him any longer), and he was filmed off site -- probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere. he said a few really un-funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance.if you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) you'll lose by watching this garbage, avoid it. if you do a lot of drugs, like adam sandler's comedy stylings (and thus have no standards whatsoever), and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie. p.s. i think the people who raved about this must work for troma or something, b/c i can't believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie. (do drugs really ruin your judgment that much?)

this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - which prove why actors - even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not!i'll say this though - the better moments show some basis for being really funny (not just wacky), to keep trying, maybe taking some classes, and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie. ("dude, where's my car" and the "scary movie" sequence have it all over this ... college attempt.)the lighting wasn't; the production wasn't; and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice try unconvincingly executed). (this reminded me of "dark star" - which is about being "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.)the talent was the bartender (he said 'dog' so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting... wasn't he? ... now that's acting!), the mark hammond guy, and marty. i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them... 3/10.-ld______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this show makes absolutely no sense. every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police? you know, the people who can actually do something about it... but every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. all the evidence has been sabotaged. and you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? yay! we've solved the murder! now like every other week, let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.

thank god this has not been renewed by itv.this series, while popular (god knows why) has a very simple - 'look i've found another body behind the flowers/bushes/trees/wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time this series' plot. the dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children - talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point.they just 'happen' to be around when someone does something out the ordinary - and no-one notices them.every time they look into and investigate someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else - messing up the lives of all - including those completely innocent.they break and enter into people's homes, stealing items and evidence (even firearms) being nosey and getting into people's lives, spying on them and going through their stuff. they never apologise, never get caught or arrested (and if they do they can talk their way out of it, even though another character who does the same gets put in prison!!!).they always come up trumps. now i know that this is an easy going series, but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes! put simply, it's unrealistic.i think that they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where they are every other week), so i do hope it never comes back.itv should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - 'someone's been murdered at the village fair - again' type series.

i saw this film at our crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavored to portray. how did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? which of the two were f***ing the girl under the tree? it was unclear. and, there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, "this must be how they sound, just soften the "r"" approach to dialogue, so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether. aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during "emotional" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. walt goggins' character was supposed to have been from morgan city, louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. the other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. before i start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia, i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably "punks" "when love comes" and "b monkey". but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. well, tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. so, i wonder, if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in minnesota and in mississippi, why can't anyone else? what a waste of my time.

only saw this movie late last night. i remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn't have been so generous. i hate hype, it can ruin a movie. i think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody. he was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. it never went too deep. redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. to me he should have been more confrontational with demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. after all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that's not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet demi fell for him? the passages giving an insight to demi and woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. there was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of john gages character. he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded i think the movies draw-card was redford and they didn't want tarnish his "image". i say what the hell robert was old in this movie! woody and demi's characters were naive in a sense, but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. but the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? las vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. i found their naivety when redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on late night tv - it was enjoyable and i if you don't think too much - also palatable

demi and woody are married, but they're poor. they meet robert redford, and he's really rich. he takes a fancy to demi, and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" one million dollars for a night with the little woman.at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep. of course demi is going to accept the offer. if she doesn't there's no first half of the movie. of course it will affect demi and woody's marriage. if it doesn't there's no second half of the movie. and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll. if it doesn't, there's no happy ending for the sake of box office.the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress. as for the rest... the script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligible. i suspect redford, moore, and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. unless some one offers you a million... miss it!gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

spoilers throughout:not good. the movie differed completely from the book(not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good.)i guess demi moore was ok. actually, i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other. however the big disappointment wasn't with ms. moore.why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart? (i'm referring to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version-just another change.)people who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall. he is also fascinating. the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot. it was almost like seeing a completely different movie.i know many movies vary widely from the books. but i also thought redford's character was a bit of a wimp. this isn't redford's fault(he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well) but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another cliché love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. that wasn't really the point of the book.this could have been a lot better. even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much, but changing so much around definitely takes it, for me, a few points down.

this movie received a great write up in blockbusters 'coming attraction' i was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02. the plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.this will never become a comedy classic, and i'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of john cleese. rowan atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a rowan atkinson sort of way!

if you are a fan of slap-stick that has terrible writing, awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you. there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks. in a brief synopsis, people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars. and yes they are all apparently super heroes, as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80+ mph, survive numerous car crashes, and endless instances of outright cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics. if you are a teen, or dont want to think for a movie, this one is for you.. not one actor outside of lovitz is believeable at all.. lovitz saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit. 2/10 (save yourself the 2 hours of pain and $4)

the commercials for rat race made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy, but since my boyfriend adores this movie (and the soundtrack), i finally relented and watched it with him tonight. i make him watch david lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff (i recently forced urbania on him), so i felt i owed him an innocuous hollywood product.i didn't want to hurt his feelings, so i saved my bitching for y'alls. yeah, rat race has its moments, but a great deal of it irritated me. let's start at the beginning. rat race was marketed as a "family film," so i was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie. (i can hear it now: "mommy, what does afro whores mean?") this scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a pg-13 movie.and while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play, within the same time frame, the slots that held the gold coins. what would have happened if they didn't? would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait? and how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place?but i'm belaboring a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist, so i'll press on. about whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they're meeting for the very first time, yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves. why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one? couldn't they have just been, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together? why the business concerning a long-ago adoption? and why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business? did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait?this illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits. and another thing - the events aren't plausible. oh, sure, the characters can do some quirky things, but the characters themselves have to be believable. take the naked gun (another jerry zucker movie) for example. frank drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of funny, which makes all the difference.) a character in rat race defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have; these clearly aren't real people, so why should i care about them?another problem i have with rat race is a moral one. the characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft. i know, i know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when i saw million dollar mystery, but there's a lot of lawbreaking in rat race, and it bothers me now. and i won't delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real-life implications of such an action; was that scene funny before 9/11?i'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart, the drugging of one's family and the nazis (whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of "seinfeld"), and move on to complain about the acting. rowan atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable; i don't know when i liked a comical character less. and the three oscar winners need new agents. whoopi came off best, but she didn't have much to work with (loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though); kathy bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief; cuba, was...oh, man. cuba, babe, please fire your agent! following instinct and chill factor, this is your third strike (be glad i haven't seen pearl harbor or snow dogs) - it's time to give your '97 best supporting actor oscar back to its rightful owner (edward norton, for primal fear). an actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite lucille ball impersonator. do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore, or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random?there's other small points that bother me (how did grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast?), but, basically, rat race amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending. they give the money to charity? what kind of ending is that?!? yeah, it's the "noble" thing to do. never mind the probability of cross-promotion/licensing whores smash mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the new mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing? yes, they say it's the journey, not the destination, that makes a trip worthwhile, but there's no journey without a destination. if there was ever an example of a "wrong happy ending," this would be it. what a bummer end to a movie that, despite my nitpicking here, i did enjoy parts of (i confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first i thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall, but he grew to be my favorite).but as far as my boyfriend knows, i found rat race quite funny and charming.

i don't know if i'm wrong or everybody els'es that says this movie is good are, sincerely i just wanna do a favor to people that has doubts about seeing it, renting it or even worse buying it(don't do it really!).the trailers and very early previews might seem fun in some way or another but its not funny at all, it gets to fall in a series of you're-supposed-to-laugh-here scenes that tend to get in really bad jokes, bad very very bad acting, tasteless scenes, cheesy effects; this movie has it all, all wrong that is.as final comment the movie would have been funny due to the basic concept, but believe me is really way far from that.

michael allred's comic book stories, particularly his work on madman, usually are a great deal of fun. "astroesque," allred's no-budget indy film, is the opposite of fun.worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience. pretty certain allred understands wtf's going on, but he's the only one. daring you to watch the entire mess isn't enough...defying you to watch the entire mess is more on target."astroesque" is some kind of movie tie-in to allred's "red rocket 7" comic book, which, ironically, is mostly unreadable. so if your "astroesque" experience isn't terrible enough definitely track down the over-sized comics and continue the fun.felt sorry for allred, who was totally out of his depth attempting a film. also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money. please buy my vhs copy, which is available right now on ebay. hurry up.

astroesque (2 outta 5 stars)i have no idea what the title is supposed... even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time... yet, it still kept me sort of interested. this is low, low budget film-making along the lines of "el mariachi", filmed in 16mm... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well-composed and visually stylish. directed, written by and starring comic book writer/artist michael allred... i guess it's no surprise that the film looks good. unfortunately, some of the acting is beyond bad... and the rest is competent at best. allred himself comes off the best... but only because he doesn't actually speak much. he just strides around looking cool most of the time... or running from crazed rednecks who are trying to kill him. the sound is also pretty bad... almost as if it was unfinished in places... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they'd planned to use? strange, vaguely science-fictiony plot... similar in tone to "the man who fell to earth"... but most of the film boils down to a standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kill-them-before-they-kill-you plot. ultimately too oblique to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers.

this film coincides with mike allred's comic book mini-series, "red rocket seven" and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for "astroesque" which ties into the book of revelations and the apocylpse. this is only part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read "rr7" too). you can easily tell that allred is used to telling stories with pictures. the direction is very good and the effects aren't bad for a $500 budget. unfortunately, mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say that they couldn't act. also, mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie. his dialouge spoon-feeds the plot to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters. this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books. 4 out of 10.

this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven. the filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is simply sickening. the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. the brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious, and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian, it was just an accident which happened like that. if you want to see a parody of reality tv, watch celebrity deathmatch - it's funnier and wittier, and most importantly shorter. i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. to be avoided like a rabid rabbit.

i saw this film last night, a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment.what can i say. i absolutely hated it. about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments.maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows, but if this had been a video/dvd or if i'd been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutes.

the people who came up with this are sick and twisted freaks how the hell can you exploit people like this? tricking people into thinking that this is real? which i probably don't doubt that it is... i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up. i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you should all be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!!!!!! i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a "real" pregnant woman in so much fricken danger! you people are bloody animals and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t.v. if this so called "reallity show" is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it. you all deserve to be friggen hunted down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i turned this off about 50 minutes into it! whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of koushun takami's book(battle royal), & make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario, deserves to be shot!it has done the film industry a good turn though. now directors like william malone(fear dot com) can say "well at least it's better than series 7" this piece of crap & dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made! be warned this is not a 'so bad it's good'flick!this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere! never see this movie!

despite the potentially fascinating premise, series 7 is weak attempt at attacking reality television. aside from its bargain basement production values, which present an eyesore 10 minutes in, the overall tone of the film is misguided. several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film, but i think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce. aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), it doesn't gel with the overall tone of the film. had the makers actually made series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality tv-colorful yet hollow edits, lame sound effects, sweeping camera motions-maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more palatable. instead series 7 meanders through the already harried world of death and game show. you can just imagine the director slapping himself on the back for stating the obvious

eddie murphy and richard pryor team up in this would-be comedy about nightclub owners being squeezed by organized crime. eddie murphy wrote and directed this obnoxious ego trip, and therefore has no one to blame but himself for its failure. this is a genuinely bad film, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as a example of murphy's contempt for his audience. it would be remarkably easy to continue beating up on this movie, but i will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now.

i wasn`t expecting much with harlem nights but i wasn`t expecting it to be as bad as it was . without doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language , it really is awful the amount there is in this film and before anyone accuses me of being a wimp let me point out two things...1 ) amongst my fave films i would include goodfellahs , platoon , raging bull while my favourite movie of all time is apocalypse now2 ) my all time favourite american television show is the hbo prison drama oz so you see films and television shows with massive amounts of swearing don`t normally bother me but the problem i had with harlem nights is to do with the fact it`s supposed to be a comedy but it seems the production team came to the conclusion that an audience laugh everytime someone ( especially if that someone is black ) says a rude word and decided to subsitute funny situations with swearing all the way through the film hoping to get a laugh. well i thought i`d never start laughing and i didn`t

just read through the other comments here, and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot.richard pryor and eddie murphy can both deliver an amazing stand-up comedy show. great actors they are not. enough about that.as for the plot? oh man. every time the movie tries to "fool" you into believing the good-guys are going to lose, you know those scenes: "what? the good-guys loses? oh.. i see, it was just a trick", it's done so terribly bad, you can spot it a mile away.it had 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day.it's a little silly that these comments has to be 10 lines now. a lot of people will fill it up with crap, for it to be eligible. being brief is an art.

1989 was already a year in where eddie murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten. funnily enough, it was also the year in where murphy directed his first film, but it also would be the first and last experiment. "harlem nights" wasn't exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely murphy and richard pryor. don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do, even if you have to face (again) the typical murphy-laugh. the worst thing from "harlem nights" are both the scenario and its terrible decors. everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs. sugar ray (pryor) and his adopted son quickie (murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie. sugar and quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. you can watch "harlem nights" that's for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.

this is truly one of the worst movies ever made--and i don't mean in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. eddie murphy is a great comic, and it is a testament to how bad this movie is that it nearly killed his career. the writing and direction are inept, the sets and staging about as imaginative as a brady bunch episode, and the acting shows just how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with. if it weren't for the costumes--which, aside from eddie murphy's ego, seem to account for the major part of the budget--you would swear this thing was slapped together by a bunch of high schoolers wasted on peppermint schnapps. that anyone could find this travesty in any way funny or entertaining is mind-boggling. it's probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are praising this stinker are barely literate. but if your idea of hilarity is della reese getting her "pinkie toe" shot off, then by all means, put aside your drool cup and go rent this movie.

by dane youssefi was kind of looking forward to this one. i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star hand-makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut. but when the star's head gets too big for the rest of his body, there's always a danger of a big-budgeted hollywood vanity production.will the filmmaker keep it real or will he just waste amounts of money (the studio's, ours) and time (the studio's, ours & his own) patting himself on the back for an hour in a half? sadly, it's the latter here.another thing i really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried-out genre. none of that here. the warring nightclub movies have become so worn-through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death. murphy does neither. he does the most clichéd: he plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were "the godfather." it's like a script where the next draft, they put in the jokes and the new ideas. but it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went: "no this is fine."probably murphy. he is credited all over this. in the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets, his name headlines across the credits about five times.the plot: a young orphan saves pryor's life and pryor adopts the little ragamuffin. 20 years later, pryor's dump has become a first-class hot spot. they're pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action. he's even got a dirty cop in his employ. but pryor comes up with a scheme, a la "the sting." murphy's screenplay plays like an unfinished first-draft that nobody had the pair to call him on. the actors aren't really allowed to stand-out much, if at all. even the almighty murphy seems to be on auto-pilot. pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as sugar ray (perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar rayfurther evidence that this one needed a polish), but everyone here is basically just on vacation. the oscar-nomination the movie received is richly deserved (joe i. tompkins' best costume design), but the production values are the only part that makes the '30's feel authentic. some sets look somewhat fake, but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts. it's rare one movie gets nominated for both a razzie and an oscar (unless it's one of lucas' new "star wars" chapters).it's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988, particularly the comedians. this is a prehistoric white man's formula. and with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it. nope. murphy is pretty much just coasting here.the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review: "murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938." jasmine guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and michael lerner has all the looks, evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat. and there are moments where pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like. he gives every scene he's in a feeling of dignity.would it have been too much to ask that della resse sing? or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her "kiss my ass talk?" and the late redd foxx doesn't get to leave much of a swan song here. he has some back-and-forth with resse which could have been some great stuff. nope. murphy wastes another opportunity again here.murphy's quick is charismatic and likable. but those moments are few and far between for sure. murphy has never looked better and never been duller. his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie.stan shaw's boxer with a horrible speech impediment isn't just painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. there's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant. you have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation. watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphy.can murphy write a screenplay? well there was "raw," but that was really stand-up material. he wrote the outline for "boomerang" and "coming to america" for sure. but her didn't have the last word there. maybe a team of er-like script doctors could've revived this one.murphy's direction is so slow and quiet, you'd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time. he has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release suspense. on some level, i think quick is the real eddie murphy. angry, young, hot-headed and ambitious. but occasionally charming. now if he were only funny sometime.there's a scene in which murphy has a femme fa-tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him. you can probably guess how it turns out. like everything else in the movie, this could have been better, but "surprisingly," murphy has not directed another movie since (he got a razzie nomination). and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either (he won the razzie for writing this!) it's great to look at and the music is beautiful, and there are a few really nice scenes. but that just falls under the category of "gems among all the junk." not enough of them.couldv'e been. shouldv'e been. wasn't. oh, well.by dane youssef

produced at a point in his career, where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted, eddie murphy took on the task of producing, directing, co-writing and starring in harlem nights, an expensive-looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners/gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930's, headed by a wisecracking hot shot (eddie murphy)and his adopted father (richard pryor) and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that, it seems, they think is rightfully theirs, simply by virtue of their color. this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation. this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here. admittedly, it was a pleasure seeing murphy and pryor together on screen, but the rest of the large supporting cast, including arsenio hall, redd foxx, della reese, michael lerner, danny aiello, jasmine guy, thomas mikal ford, stan shaw, and eddie's brother, are really given precious little to do (though i will admit murphy's fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably, the movie's best scene). murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen. the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar, but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats.

this takes place in 1920s harlem. a black owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen.terrible vanity project for eddie murphy. it tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both. the comedy simply isn't funny and the drama is boring and badly acted. you think a film with three comedy legends--eddie murphy, redd foxx and richard pryor--would be great but it isn't. there's nonstop swearing and the opening scene has a young boy shooting a man to death (this is shown as being ok). also we have the beautiful della reese degraded into playing a madam. one of the "comedic" highlights has a long, unfunny and terribly vicious fight between her and murphy. a boring, offensive and stupid mess. not the worst murphy movie but pretty close. a 1 all the way.

in the 1930s, hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy, charley chase and the little rascals. most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time. however, a lesser-known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and zasu pitts (later, todd was paired with the equally untalented patsy kelly). try as i might, i just can't stand these pictures--they just aren't funny. plus, unlike laurel and hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co-stars. before you just think i am a crank, understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies, so i am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre, this team is among the worst. part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at roach, they were given all the scripts no one else wanted. if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea, it was often given to todd and pitts/kelly--and usually it showed.in this film, however, the team is at their absolute lowest. it's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot. the film begins with zasu in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer. as for zasu, she's a completely annoying moron. not the lovable type moron (like stan laurel or lou costello), but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious. as for thelma, as usual, she's the rather bland "straight man" and as such has little to do but react to zasu's boorish behavior.the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills. considering that the pills are highly dangerous, when the attorney asks zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb. and, while they were called "pills", they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls. swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy. when they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive, everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends.as i said, i am not a fan of this team. however, even for those who want to like the film, there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short! when i talked over this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was overly generous!!

peter yates film from the pen of steve tesich is a relatively low key "thriller" that doesn't really manage to get off the ground. story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran (james woods) who, the police believe, may have taken revenge on his ex-employer. as the "eyewitness", william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act.hurt is well below his usual strength, and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver. james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles. worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black.in retrospect steve tesich's story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick. the plot is far too contrived.friday, october 17, 1997 - video

i'm a collector of films starring ms. weaver, so i bought this only because of her being in it. i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies. she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs. these bombs include this movie, deal of the century, one woman or two, and half moon street. she also appeared in the year of living dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than notable. in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel, aliens, the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters. before the release of aliens, i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out. luckily she wasn't.back to eyewitness though, the film is boring. it doesn't create any suspense. william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in, and the atmosphere is just to dry. sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering.watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie. watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl.

i mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the buffalo - niagara falls area might be something different. unfortunately i was incorrect. there are are many problems with "the falls", that really have nothing to do with it's low budget video production. immediately one has to question why all the constant narration? my feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow along, without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling. the acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. finally, the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video, which i found to be totally unacceptable. the narration, bad acting, and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided. - merk

as with most viewers of this film, i'm an avid reader of the books. the first 2 films have buck, ray and chloe as the main characters but in this the second sequel they play second-fiddle to louis gossett jr's presidential effort. world at war is based on the meeting he has with buck in the book series.the problem is - this film is as awful as the first two. amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play (i won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series). other illogical parts feature. i really really want cloud 10 to make a good left behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2.

i first read about the left behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since i have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world, so imagine my surprise and joy when i found a copy of left behind : world at war in my local library, nestling innocently among the big budget action movies.now as a movie it's extremely poor. the acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the "special effects" would have looked dated in the early 90's. being the third part of a series the story would be unintelligible to anyone who hadn't seen or read about the other left behind movies, and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughable.on the religious front, i don't think anyone who wasn't already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways. how are you supposed to fear the antichrist when he's got a comedy russian accent, and the worst of his powers are some pitiful cgi?however, my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and dupe people into believing that it's a big budget action movie. upon picking up the box and reading the spiel i immediately noticed something odd...nowhere on the packaging was there a mention of the true nature of this film. to someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that left behind : world at war was no different from the latest tom clancey. nor, on the copy that i rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series.considering the whole premise of the series is that the antichrist has deceived the whole world, i find it extremely hypocritical that the film makers tried to deceive me twice before i even got the to counter! if you're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it?the simple fact is, had this not been a "christian" movie with the built in fan base that goes with it, i seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day. if cloud ten were hoping that i'd see the error of my ways and give myself to god, i'm afraid to say i would have died of boredom and/or laughed myself to death before i ever had the chance.

based on the 2007 spy novel by david ignatius, body of lies tells the story of a cia operative roger ferris (dicaprio) who is sent to jordan to track down an al-qaeda mastermind, all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his jordanian hosts and his manipulative american boss ed hoffman (crowe).anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of ferris by hoffman, but the actual story is much more mundane. instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy american ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of amman jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals. only during a scene where ferris takes his new-found iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from jordanian men.compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding. ferris flies to jordan, ferris gets expelled from jordan, ferris flies to washington, ferris flies to the uk, ferris flies back to jordan, hoffman flies to jordan, hoffman returns home to take care of his kids  an on it goes. this is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of the amazing race, not a spy thriller.in body-punishing loyalty to his craft, crowe gained an impressive 63 pounds of flab for the role of portly ed hoffman, thus joining the small select club of actors consisting of robert de niro and christian bale as thespians who've subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles. it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.

after two terrorist attacks in europe, one in london and the other in amsterdam, the prime suspect is the leader al-saleem (alon aboutboul). the cia agent roger ferris (leonardo dicaprio) that operates in the middle east is assigned by his superior at langley ed hoffman (russell crowe) to keep a "safe house" in amman under surveillance, and he associates to the chief of security in jordan, hani salaam (mark strong). roger does not disclose the whole operation to hani, and it fails due to the intervention of ed. meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse aisha (golshifteh farahani) and he gets close to her family. when roger plots another scheme to catch al-saleem using the innocent architect omar sadiki (ali suliman) as decoy to lure al-saleem, he jeopardizes not only the safety of sadiki, but also aisha that is kidnapped. after the execution of sadiki, roger tries to negotiate the release of aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse."body of lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through europe and middle east despite the names of ridley scott, leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe. the imdb user rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology, satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking, but that is not my case. it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. the rich character performed by leonardo dicaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in middle east due to his biotype. but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east. the rescue of roger ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. my vote is four.title (brazil): "rede de mentiras" ("network of lies")

maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. however, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. just what the doctor ordered ... right? how many more of these movies has hollywood made? one thousand? two thousand? the formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. the locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. this movie seemed to run-on interminably. "when will this movie end?" i repeatedly thought to myself. leonardo dicaprio was totally unbelievable as a cia operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight russell crowe plays a cia bureaucrat. please note that in this movie the on site operative is "lean and mean" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. this is called stereotyping. what was the casting director thinking? why not have jack nicholson play an overweight office clerk? or nicole kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? and the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. an obviously non-arab american (mr. dicaprio) trying to pass himself off as an arab ... speaking fluent arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable arab masquerade ... trying to romance a palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. by now you get the point. next time try casting an actual arab in the role. not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. there should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. next stop for this movie - dvd land and oblivion. and one other thing. don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. the pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.

if andrei tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror. this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world, i am convinced. a son, without a name, takes care of his mother, without a name. they love each other, i guess. no, they don't, i'm sure. these aren't characters. they aren't even actors playing characters. at least it could be pretty, but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a macintosh computer. and could sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration? you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10.

do not waste your money or time. terrible movie. bad acting, plot all over the place. really, really bad acting. man, this movie is just plain bad. i shut it off at 7 minutes. the script is bad, the directing is bad, it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class. yes, it's that bad. the acting is not convincing at all, mind you i saw only 7 minutes of it. how this movie made it to dvd, is beyond me. it should have been left in the editing storage room. i saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, i sure's heck won't do that next time :_)

the film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. what does it show? it shows their living in very poor conditions. it shows how tenderly they "walk" (really he is bringing her). but what do we see further? after their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. it is not possible. a person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. he would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. another thing. the author devoted this film to andrey tarkovsky. we see he learned many tarkovsky's visual effects. but in sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. someone has compared this film with "mirror" ("zerkalo"). there is nothing common except these visual effects. "mirror" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation.

i loved this movie! it's the finest parody of russian cinema to date. who else but sokurov could lampoon tarkovsky so brilliantly. you thought "stalker" was slow? well, step up to the plate. "mat i syn" makes "stalker" look like "raiders of the lost ark". by no means should you miss this film! there's no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast-forward button on your vcr. sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes.i suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black, silent screen (wasn't this already explored in "in the soup"?).apparently the filmmaker (and fans) have forgotten that "motion" is the first word of "motion picture".!!!major spoilers ahead!!!want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved? here's a step by step guide:1. find a talented photographer.2. find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape (think tuscany!). if you need inspiration, watch some luxury car or perfume commercials.3. shoot about 3 rolls of film.4. photoshop the results to play around with saturation, blur & aspect ratio.5. now just get out your movie camera, film 40 of the best pictures and have your "actors" mumble their lines off-screen. don't worry about writing it ahead of time - just let the actors say whatever they want (lines like "do you want a drink?" and "let's get something to eat" are really all you need to fill up 8 minutes or so). if you can't think of enough dialog - no problem! just have them repeat what they say a few times. if that still isn't enough, just let the camera run anyway.congratulations, another masterpiece! as a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! the static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpeg encoding - a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.

this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia, as she lays dying.i am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. on one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. there is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. the son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that i think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family. it also cruelly reminds me that i could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. "mat i syn" is cruel reality.on the other hand, "mat i syn" moves really too slowly. do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? with my previous experience of "telets" and "aleksandra", i am so tempted to put "mat i syn" among them as a total bore.i guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. i surely see the beauty of it, but maybe i am not in the right state of mind.

"midnight clear" has a great premise. a group of over-educated, overly bright gi's are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the bulge. the gi's encounter a group of battle-weary german regulars, and it becomes clear that they don't want to fight anymore.therein lies the problem. it's really pretty simple. if the germans want to surrender, they do so and that's the end of the movie. if the germans want to fight, they do so and that's also the end of the movie. so instead of doing either the gi's and germans play games with each other, even throwing snowballs at one point. interesting for one or two scenes, but it soon becomes very annoying. after all, these are germans. the enemy. nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot. the film does noting to make them more human. in fact, much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them, including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man! why should i care about such characters? just shoot them and let's move on to the battle of the bulge. it's much more interesting, anyway.one good scene: the gi's are returning from a recon of the german position, where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire. while walking across a clearing, they realize a group of germans have their mausers leveled at them. the germans are about 100 yards away. the gis then do something i've never seen any gi's do in any sillywood movie. they throw down their rifles and throw up their hands! unusual as this may be in films, it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance. though it seems far, in reality it's point-blank range for those rifles. i'll lay odds that someone working on this film was a cruffler!

recap: a band of five young american men, all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the ardenne offensive during the wwii get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity. they're in really bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food. but after a while there is some enemy activity, and it is very odd. not hostile, but odd. it seems like there is a german squad out there, in equally bad condition, that want nothing more than to surrender.comments: based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen. indeed it is a different war movie, much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles. but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall flat in the movie. it is not suspenseful, just different and in many ways absurd. many times people just act insane, and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at.so when this mental pressure fails to come through, the main building piece of the entire story, i thought the story fell through. it wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message. actually it did nothing.the cast is interesting, many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers. the acting is good, but not stellar, and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone. much of that too i feel is due to that this story, these characters need the time, space and pace given in a novel, that they can't be given here. and going halfway definitely isn't good enough.4/10

my father insisted i should watch this film with him and i regret that i wasted my time watching--i want that approximate hour and a half back! the "funny" little film concerns the elderly don ameche staying with his son, tom selleck. it turns out that ameche isn't just "forgetful" like he's been told, but has dementia (it seems a lot like alzheimers). and, because dad is so frequently "out to lunch" he gets into so much trouble again and again--almost like the adorable tyke from baby's day out. the problem, though, is that you know baby's day out is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine. plus, you aren't laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness. but, in this case, you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind--and where's the humor in that?! if this film had been more successful, would the producers have then made films making fun or people with cerebral palsy or a flesh-eating virus?!?! there are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film.

folks! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're going senile and want to be put out of their misery. several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, saving them from his death-traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process. the movie seems to hate its main character, which makes it all the more painful to watch. there's also the usual tacked-on love-interest and predictable ending.this movie was also the first time i'd seen tom selleck without a mustache, and i remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick. but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie.

let's see, cardboard characters like muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. you'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts! turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world....the world of religious fantasy!--complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of papier mache. everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor chap who goes to heaven where he can presumably spend eternity with the blockheads that created this masterpiece of the absurd. i think i'd opt for hellfire myself. go see something else, unless you are stoned, in which case, you might actually like it! couldn't hurt!

evil behind you, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to shove the writer/directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil. sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.the way its message is presented almost reminds me of the stories i've heard of the spanish inquisition! from one real christian to another, avoid this like the plague, fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message!!the acting was horrible,the selection of muslim terrorists was racist and unfair(they're terrorists so they must be muslims). the premise of this was good, the story provided a great conduit for its message, however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak.you'd be better off dusting off your old "ghost" dvd with mr swayze to better receive this message. at least that movie didn't try to shove itself down your throat. or if you like good christian movies with a powerful message, try "end of the spear"

i gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons. first, i felt that this movie was definitely preaching and i hate that. still, it's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first place.my friend and i rented this movie because it sounded interesting. the back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle, someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like. something i am very interested in, indeed. this movie almost hit the target. it was more like on the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself...the basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments. however, because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms, the men of the couples are now able to feel, smell, hear, and see the demons of the spiritual world. in that order. apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.this movie is very clichéd. they took the title seriously as the men, while chained to the beds, demand their women look behind them because there is something there.although a good effort for what it was, i think the special effects could have been done so much better. the demon scratching at the woman was, in a word, hilarious. the wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died. we were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair, though.the message is one that i don't care to comment on, other than i think the christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.and so i give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault i am not a christian and don't like this type of message, and i got a kick out of making comments throughout. my friend and i watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of mst3k.

this movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. there was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie. it wasn't. in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. beside each one are two attractive women. the men begin asking "do you hear that" or "do you see them". we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. the women do not see these creatures. this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour. it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called "plot" of the film. we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists. what is this about? we never find out. the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab, but why? what is the point? we have no idea. this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline. sorry but this movie was a waste of $4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. take my advice. don't rent it.

i would have given this less than a 1 rating if it were possible. the entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor. what a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! let's see...assemble the prettiest cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack)...throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up...and viola! an abominable piece of trash that the director and/or producer should be ashamed to put their name on. how much worse can the horror genre get? and don't use "low budget" as an excuse...i have seen many great low-budget films....in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget. if you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror film, then for god's sake don't make one at all!!!

i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes, just to say i saw the end. if you want *real* mythology, flawlessly executed, look for armand assante's "the odyssey." great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked - the stories are fantastic on their own. i only hope sean astin needed the money. and sophocles and ovid must be whirling in their graves - wherever those may be.at least with sorbo's version, the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library.i'm surprised halmi could turn out something so amusing (the tv series), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.

this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i've ever seen. it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to... 3 or 4, i think. it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having ever read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the oracle of delphi to tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of sam raimi's entertaining series, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.i could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-shakespearean tripe. it is a poor re-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that crichton's "the 13th warrior" attempted in regards to the beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength. a sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who i'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply.

i don't know how expensive was the creation of this movie but the effects were awful. half of the movie was filmed on stage in front of a movie canvas (that's sure that blue box wouldn't look so artificial). when they traveled on a boat, the background canvas was moved imitating the movement of waves but the characters weren't moving. the cgi effects: terrible (i am not sure but i guess the effect were created with paint and made a gif sequence of them - next time the creators should hire a professional cgi maker team). it looks like the cgi creator would have drawn on the picture strip with shaky hands. awful, that's sure. when i first saw the trailer, i thought it was created in 1983. one of my friend told me the correct date: 2005. my jaw dropped, i was so shocked, i thought he was kidding. people, i recommend you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you won't enjoy it.

eh. i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in. i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the herakles myths, and because the commercials for it looked serious, i was expecting something that was halfway decent.ten minutes into the film, i realized that it was utter crap. the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bare(and i mean bare) minimum. parents, half brother, and labors seemed to be named correctly. other than that, the rest of the film seemed to be one giant inaccuracy. i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film. the disney version was made for little kids, therefore wasn't too serious. this movie, with all the sex, violence, and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film.

i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie, and sat through the whole thing. i can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth.the movie started out ok, i think the initial characterization of herc was true to the myths. both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb. but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all. huh? other problem: terrible cgi. the satyr looked ok, but the rest of the critters just looked terrible, especially the hart, the phoniest looking beast in the movie. and how come leelee sobieski's skin was sometimes golden, sometimes normal? the worst part for me--and everyone should cringe at this--was the twelve labors of hercules. because the producers obviously didn't want to cover all of them; maybe they thought us primitive screw-heads watching this garbage couldn't count that high. instead of the twelve labors of hercules, we got the five labors of hercules. yes, the five labors! wtf?!? he did't even finish the last one, so it was really the 4 1/2 labors! just terrible. i'll take hercules: the legendary journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week.

my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching.

my only question is: why did they make this movie? did they have a script or did they make it up as they went along? boom boom doesn't look like a charley davis. john garfield probably turned over in his grave if he saw this.

after the suicide of his father, charlie 'kid' davis (ray `boom boom' mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend tiny (michael chiklis) and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer. on the road, they meet gina (jennifer beals) hitchhiking, they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie's girlfriend. johnny ticotin (rod steiger) is convinced by tiny to be charlie's couch, and the powerful agent alex dumas (joe mantegna), after watching him fighting, becomes his manager, promoting charlie's career. this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it. i do not like boxing, but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme. but this one is horrible! predictable, full of clichés, having an awful lead actor, a pure waste of time. my vote is three.title (brazil): `corpo e alma' (`body and soul')

the original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. john garfield, ann revere, lilli plmer, william conrad, canada lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..james wong howe. this remake is abominable. in spite of the presence of rod steiger, joe mantegna and jennifer beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original. only the main character's name, charlie davis, is the same in both films. i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. i am amazed that rod steiger participated. this may be the only bad film he ever made. maybe he needed the paycheck.

according to "lucien rebatet" in his "histoire de la musique" (robert lafont, bouquins 1973 page 338) beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. he had quite a number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "vienese aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". but musicians , even composers did not qualify for husbands of "fine ladies". haydn was a "servant" of prinz von esterhazy, mozart died from drink or poison and bethoven was according to rebatet a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in vienna. a british biographer, newman says that beethoven contracted syphilis, before he was 40. that he became deaf because of that, is possible, but not certain.the ninth symphony was premiered on may 7, 1824 in the kärntnertortheater in vienna, along with the consecration of the house overture and the first three parts of the missa solemnis. this was the composer's first on-stage appearance in twelve years; the hall was packed. although the performance was directed by michael umlauf the theater's kapellmeister, beethoven shared the stage with him quiet.so what remains of this "female fantasy". ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good, but too linear, based on the painting by ferninand waldmüller date 1823. i have it in front of me. it shows a man that despises (perhaps hates) the world. with good reason.

am i the only person who saw and remembers amadeus. every scene in "copying" has its counterpart in the milos forman, amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings, to the entrance of anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key, to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at beethoven's feet a la salieri before the dying mozart. does no one else recall the dialog in that script: salieri "time?" , mozart "common time". ....."we begin with the strings..." and so it "copies".remember cynthia nixon leaning against a door jamb, tears falling down her freckled face - same scene, just replace her with beethoven's nephew. even the scatological humor (fart jokes) are the same. we even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls salieri in the banquet hall. does no one else remember? !!!!and the scene where anna cries to god "why did you give me this gift?"... salieri said the same thing!and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character identifications you'd find in a children's story. "i am mr. beethoven. i am the composer...."and what, after all, is the purpose of the bridge builder? other than to juxtapose the technical against the artistic... a comparison that is not at all developed - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to beethove who was a master of the technical.there's only one great scene - the playing of the ninth. first, the music, which of itself takes you to tears. but then, there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the copyist keeping time and beethoven conducting which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy. so intense, it's almost embarrassing.but, please - the rest of the film - where is the world's collective memory? you have seen this all before .... and better!

from kreestos: the dialog is terrible, awful, drivel. acting poor. many plot flaws. i don't recommend this at all.from wikipedia:artistic licenses the working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both of whom were male, not female as depicted in the film.the copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score. in fact, they were berated by beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score.the movie is set in 1824 during the composition of beethoven's ninth symphony. throughout the movie beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. in reality, beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. the ninth symphony was composed at a time when beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely. at this point in his life, most of beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. it can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him.in the film, beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight sonata. this is an anachronism as the sonata no. 14 "quasi una fantasia" was not named "moonlight" until several years after his death.

second nature will not go down as one of the worst tv movies of 2003, but perhaps the worst of all time. formulaic, derivative, and every performance phoned in, from far, far away. everyone associated with this project should have a hard time looking in the mirror.

it's a shame that quality actors like baldwin and booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money. but, hey, it's a cruel world...this is just another one of a long line of assassin thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it appear more appealing than it is. sure, it has some nice locations, it's a slick production, there is some good camera work and editing, and it's fairly well paced, overall.so, what's the real problem? quite simply, the whole premise is just totally unbelievable. however, instead of spoiling a rotten story for you, i'll let you find out what it's all about, that is, if you can get through it. i managed, but only because i like baldwin and i kept hoping that it would get better.it didn't. and, it had one of the most anti-climactic endings that i've seen for a long time. in fact, maybe never...but, it's harmless fun, i guess, if you've got nothing better to do.

there are many distinct problems with the movie "killshot". for one, there are way too many coincidences. the husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up, with someone the killer knows. okay i will take that one. the kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it. okay, i will take that one as well. before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer, who doesn't kill him but decided to go with him on the job. it's starting to get real weak. then they show up, on the same day that the husband has an interview with his wives boss. no one is there but the wife and the husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office. they make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right guy. that is just in the first 15 minuets.there are a lot more holes in this movie then i care to talk about. why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agency i don't know. why he didn't shoot the woman on her porch, i don't know. why he kept letting that dumb kid make all those stupid moves and mess a whole lot of crap up, i don't know. why the girlfriend was even in the movie, i don't know. why he decided not to pocket the gun and just leave it out on the counter, i don't know. why they even went into the witness protection program, i don't know. what i do know is that the casting director did a great job, the director of photography did very good work, the location scout picked great locations, and the production designer was worth every penny. so my advice for anyone that is going to pick a script that is going to be so well worked by the crew, make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not foiled by a peak through an open window.

following the whirlwind success of the wrestler (see my review), mickey rourke had this "gem" head straight to video. every copy was rented for months and i even heard some good buzz around it. so months later i caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. first of all...one of the locations in the film (walpole island) is a place i used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. cool huh? that's about where the coolness ends with this dud. i mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful, and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and mickey $%#@*&! rourke playing a native canadian/american hit-man?!?! what in the lord's name were they thinking?? he doesn't even resemble native blood and his attempt at the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous. they could have went anywhere with this story...they could have hired a native actor, or changed rourke's character, how about a white man raised by native parents? instead they made killshot a complete and utter joke.as you may have caught mickey rourke "stars" in killshot, i use that term loosely. i have never liked rourke much although his oscar winning performance was decent enough. this shows and confirms my dislike for him. he looks bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt at portraying a native is bordering on insulting i would think. he makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story. diane lane, although well respected in hollywood, turns in another drab performance. she has had her moments but overall she just usually doesn't take off in any one performance. she looks like she is going to be great but then when she isn't, its even more disappointing. thomas jane plays her protective husband. i've always felt jane deserves a bigger career than he has. i think he's got action star in his blood. all said and done his performance in killshot is actually not bad. he doesn't take things too far and he's tough and almost heroic in a way. him and lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesn't get a lot in the way of his character. i have absolutely no idea why rosario dawson a) did this movie and b) had a character at all. her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad. i have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless. the only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by joseph gordon-levitt as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with rourke's hit-man. gordon-levitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging. if this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash. he literally saves this from utter crap. his performance is almost worth watching this drivel for.oscar nominated director...whoa wait? yes oscar nominated director john madden (i think the football coach could have done a better job) helms this mess. i have actually never seen shakespeare in love, but i remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful. screenplay writer hossein amini has done nothing i recognize but apparently has been slated to write the next jack ryan movie and after this mess i can't even imagine why they'd want him. i understand this is based on a novel and i really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. a little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit-man and his partner and the mess they get involved in. unfortunately unless you're a huge rourke fan or really love joseph gordon-levitt then there is no reason to put yourself through this pain. i did it for you and i still feel the pain. 4/10

well, killshot is not awful, but it comes close. production values are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job (except for rosario dawson in a wasted role), but the story is just pathetic. i don't know if the elmore leonard book had such dumb characters,since i haven't read it, but i'm guessing that the book was supposed to be at least slightly humorous. the movie has no detectable humor. after the first twenty minutes, you'll be yelling at the screen, "oh, come on! nobody's that stupid!!" in a nutshell, and without any spoilers, everybody acts in a manner convenient to the plot, which makes no sense anyway. a very frustrating and unrealistic movie, which may account for it sitting on the shelf for as long as it did.

atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. boyer is a french thief hiding in the casbah of algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. meanwhile, he falls for lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere. reminiscent of casablanca in some ways, it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman. it's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and boyer wooing lamarr in the shadows. personally, i didn't care for boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was utterly nonexistent.stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as boyer's henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in algiers. sigrid gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of boyer. his brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with lamarr.especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured. it sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. the ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending; that doesn't stop it from being sappy.

algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original pepe le moko, directed by duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming pepe, jean gabin. if you want to fully experience the casbah and the characters in algiers, i recommend you don't even watch this movie and see pepe le moko instead, for it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality. furthermore, the ending is so dramatic and key to pepe's character that you'll find the algiers version intolerable. although algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene, the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. plus, the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes, particularly pepe's in the last scene and gaby's (at all times) but also when she's on the boat. frankly, algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.

pepe le moko, played by charles boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah, a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all. for le moko, although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can't leave, because the moment he does, he knows he'll be arrested.boyer's performance was good, and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar. he captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. the movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which i'll mention two. first was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the casbah. that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly. so, neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn't enter, nor the statement by inspector slimane (also a decent performance by joseph calleia) that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. i also found it difficult to believe that le moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby (hedy lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. i understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he's shot and killed by the police.) i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap.this is worth watching for boyer, and to a lesser extent calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10

it is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the palestinian struggle against the israeli occupation of palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the jews like der yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real palestinian struggle and about anything palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film . the movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story.

let me first just say that in the past, i have been a huge carlin fan. i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet. what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way, and give us his unique perspective on those things. it wasn't always meant to be funny, but you always respected his opinions, because they were presented in such a clever way. but you are all diseased is just a long rant. he doesn't give us any unique perspective on anything, he just gives us a long list of stuff that he's p.o.'d at. there is no insight, no cleverness, just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about. and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. i don't mind anger fueled comedy, but george could have done so much better. i really hope that george carlin's next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past.

director / lead actor dutcher revels in this look-at-me film, wherein he attempts to gain worldly acceptance for tarnishing the otherwise very upbeat world of mormon missionaries. some of the acting is fair. but some roles are unrealistic, i.e. the ominous (rather than fatherly) mission president, etc. the film does give a fair look at how some missionaries may struggle with their faith, but the actual missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it, in terms of being upbeat, cohesive, and inspired. the only inspiration i see in this film is dutcher's self-inspiration. the film is slow and boring, and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project.

okay, i sensed that a film by mormons, about mormons, for mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did i know how so very painful it would be. a little known fact is that mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. the church's official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the mormon community, including the wonderful short film "cipher in the snow" which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's. then there's neil labute's disturbingly masterful ouvre....however, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn't focus on mormons or any specific mormon theology. instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. "god's army" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. while this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted mormon, director richard ductcher's ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge "god's army" unwatchable by almost any standard.dutcher's own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting mormons you're ever likely to meet. of course the cast's sorry performances aren't helped any by dutcher's pathetic script. he should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the church, but, as can be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. it should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the church's darker side are addressed with little other than faith. at one point an african-american missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so). instead of addressing the church's actively racist history, perhaps the sorest spot in mormon theology which even church leaders don't defend anymore, dutcher's troubled character instead ponders joseph smith's murder--an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films.if you knew little about mormons before watching this film, you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs. if you are mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about.

this movie has a look and feel of many "fresh" directors (closeups and focus on the emotions being experienced by the actors). the point of the film was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast. the point being "have faith in jesus christ and the morman church" oh, and if you read or hear anything contrary to the teachings of the prophet, it is just haterade. (fuel for hatred)

a dull stroll through the banalities of mormon prosthelatizing. utterly un-funny. a testament to the widely held theory, that in order for bathroom humor to be funny, it must necessarily be vulgar; it also bolsters the claim that a close relationship with jesus makes you not funny. more propaganda than film, don't worry about any touchy social issues coming up at the dinner table after this one. the saving grace of this movie is its accurate portrayal of young mormon females as particularly attractive. oh well, its your $7.50.

the movie is nice well pictured, but no originality...this movie is directly copied from "the hitch" where salman plays like a date dr. like will smith, and govinda like some fat jerk, who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian flimi style, the bride's father doesn't like the bride's lover and gets some other groom, and govinda the bride's lover comes in the end and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff.the comedy was real good, no doubt when the hitch meets hindi would be more funnier....ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months...

i watched this movie only coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david dhawan. bad bad comeback by david dhawan.he has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag!! what a waste of talent and beauty it was?donno why actors agree on doin movie like this.there was not a whit of practicality in this movie.the movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential bollywood has.the only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her! being a remake of hollywood flick hitch its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake. i consider this to be the worst ever movie i hv seen. awful 1/10

i was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a 'laugh riot'. but the movie turned out be disappointing.you will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can't ignore the flaws and the shortcomings.1. the missile scene was total stupidity.2. katrina kaif and govinda pair looked awful. (he's 49 and she's just 24... more than double of her age) 3. salman's comedy is less of acting and more of overacting.4. songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie.5. some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny, and 6. poor and flawed story.however, there are few pluses- 1. govinda. great individual performance.2. some scenes are actually quite funny.3. kattrina kaif. looks and acting keeps on improving with every film.4. rajpal yadav's don sequences. though under-utilized but hilarious.so 4 good points, 6 bad ones.. this one gets 4/10.

i didn't know what to expect when i started watching this movie, by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out. this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year...in fact, in the last ten years. david dhawan should just give up his career as a director. i am yet to come across one original script that david dhawan has worked on. this one was a complete bit y bit rip off hitch. i have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one (which was pretty decent). i fail to understand what actors like salman and govinda saw in this script. i read somewhere, that this was supposed to be govinda's comeback vehicle. if thats true, then only god can save his career. salman just overacted to the hilt. govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted. katrina kaif and lara dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason. please stay away form this one!

if you are planning to watch 'partner' and are on imdb reading reviews about it, you have already wasted too much time over this stupid, idiotic, awful movie.it's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of the movie 'hitch.' i choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews i had heard about this movie, and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it - i thought that after all its david dhawan who is making it, and it has govinda - how bad can it be? but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, i couldn't take it any more, and turned off my computer.overacting by everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total time waste - i gave it a 1-star rating because that's the lowest you can do. if i could go lower, i would have given it a -100 rating.

david dhawan copied hitch and such an unofficial copy the film isn't even 1/2 as funny or amusing as the original it's boring with forced stories like the lara track of having a child and no hubby plus there is an unwanted stupid chota don and david tries to choke drama too but the film looks disjointed, boringsongs just pop in, so does romance and everything barring some funny govinda scenes, the dance before interval nothing else is worth mentioning the last few scenes are quite funny but there tend to get too longdavid's direction is as bad as maine pyaar kyun kiyaa, he needs to change his style or attempt something good music is saving grace, some songs are good but the situations seem forcedgovinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines in initial reels but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with salman in his cabin and towards the endsalman just plays himself and his nasal tone plus his fake style of acting is a headachelara is avoidable, katrina is fake as usualthe kid overacts

i just don't know how this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film is a blockbuster. it was so boring with a very, very weak (or no) story-line and wasn't even a jot funny. the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem (salman khan) is a love guru and is helping hapless & romantic bhaskar (govinda) to get the girl he wants. i'm not saying that i didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything, i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. the only two reasons why i can say it's a super-hit are: 1. salman khan & govinda are on-screen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it can't be. but it was a really good movie.2. salman khan's name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya. so it's just luck.i heard that it's a remake of hitch, i've not seen it & i'm glad i didn't. music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner, you're my love & soni de nakhre but what is the use of it in a really bad film, that too, if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet? she is completely crap. neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress. i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan. overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif. its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again.

soon after this movie was released,salman khan was handed over a 6 year imprisonment.(read further to know why am i mentioning this.)and i heaved a sigh of relief.not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant no more salman khan movies,no more his histrionics and no more over hyped acting(read overacting).this movie made no sense whatsoever. the scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated .according to the movie script it would chase anyone.but ultimately it finds only salman khan bare chested. well this is what happened.the rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of .001 to believe that. then it chases salman khan ,who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience. (in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above ,unless they are paid to do that.)another of breath taking ,unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs .later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and katrina kaif to katrina's father and bingo . everything is fine and govinda marries kartina....this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money.this movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching . the plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishing..for ex choota don...what a waste of characters.after this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an oskar...(hahahah...which means i would never watch)

this is not a good movie. it is a tried remake of the english movie 'the hitch'. but it insults the original one. this is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like 'david dhawan' who is credited to directing good movies like "raja babu", "coolie no.1", "hero no. 1"...the main theme for this movie is taken from "the hitch" with some changes so as to appeal to the indian audience but somehow the story and the screenplay is not convincing enough. plus the acting from the lead roles i.e. salman khan and govinda is pitiful. it seems that they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest. i do not consider this fascinating and least of all comic. what was the director thinking ? added to this the viewers have to bear the case of govinda's over-acting. it was simply unbearable. i advise the viewers to watch it at your own risk. my rating of 2 for this movie could be considered to be a very generous one.instead i would advise the viewers to watch the english movie "hitch" which is a lot better.

this is another bollywood remake of a hollywood movie. hitch...if i'm correct.the film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from govinda who has become a legend within indian cinema and will always bring his a game in terms of comedies. another bonus is rajpal yadav; who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics 'don', an indian icon of cinema. lara dutta is a plus...i know i sound shallow but its mainly because i have a soft spot for her, she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced. her acting is weak...but she still shines. salman khan is atrocious, he tries to bring the cool, charming depths but fails miserably, he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason. 'thats not acting mate, thats called being mentally challenged'katrina kaif is just bad...not very good at anything. no charisma, no talent..and i don't see why people consider her pretty... the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that katrina's character was remotely attracted to govinda. the only good thing is the music...'you're my love' was the best in the soundtrack.

talk about over acting...!!!! not just by govinda, but also by salman and lara....the direction was awful. the first half hour you would pretty much want to switch the movie off..because this movie is a real stinker (mark my words. i liked govinda in some o his comedy roles like haseena maan jaayegi, jodi no. 1, akhiyon se goli maare and jis desh mein ganga rehta hai and this does not compare to any of them. and salman khan should not do comedy roles at all!! he sucks. he does not know how to do comedy. the only good comedy role he did was in andaz apna apna, which was brilliant next to amir khan. there were so many 'overly done stupidly unfunny' scenes in this movie that make you want to take out the dvd and burn it so no one else in your house watches it ever again.

there wasn't a 0 in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figure.it is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star-cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting, and an awful script.this movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of hitch. salman khan with his usual take-off-you-shirt theme and govinda with his in-humorous laughs. if somebody had told 2 decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman (after his success with maine pyar kiya), i would have written him/her off.

honestly, i have to admit that i go and see certain stupid films based on the hype they have generated or are currently generating. this dumb salman khan & govinda feature is one of those stupid films. okay, by now we've all seen 'hitch' starring will smith as a date doctor trying to help out odd people find true. then why would we need to see salman khan re-enact this? therein lies the $64,000 question. in case you were wondering, govinda plays the oddball in search of the love of his life (an unreachable socialite) played by katrina kaif.lara dutta is along to play sallu's eva mendes, and sallu's real-life love kaif pretty much plays her character like every role you've see her in thus far, no stretch no acting required. and for nearly three and a half hours we get tortured with spoofs of other bollywood films and characters or better yet we get treated to low rate performances of past hit films. rajpal yadav co-stars. f

do you hear that sound? that's the sound of h.g. wells rolling over in his grave, between this version and spielberg's cinematic abortion it's been a tough year for the classic novel. but at least steven got a few things right compared to this crapperella. hello, the ships weren't big insects, they had names. they were tripods and the aliens worked in threes. the ships and the aliens were all wrong, you don't really get to see the aliens until the end. the effects and the cast work fine. but these actors are much better then this "movie" deserves. the bulk if not all the movie is the howell character wondering through the devastation, meeting one person, they join him and he looses them for one reason or the other. there's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie. it's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something. so fat the only and mean only watchable adaptation of the war of the worlds story is the george pal version way back in the 1950s. the black hole.

it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise. didn't they do that with truman capote the same year, and the zodiac killer last year? interesting.writer/director david michael latt didn't have steven spielberg's budget and c. thomas howell is not tom cruise. this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $588 million worldwide.the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles, who played a pastor that was giving up on his god.gary busey was creepy as an army lt.

why does c thomas howell do these movies? cruise (howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effort.where do i start here? production values - i'll start with the good stuff. the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. the set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.script - terrible. a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. the amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. very poor storyline (but so was the cruise wotw) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.special fx - okay, i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, washington, liner. but in the main the "alien" machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.acting - i'm a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie. there is no comparison. he overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. hysterical. but after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green (zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. i honestly could not understand one word he said - i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the dvd did not have subtitles. this seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. none of them are good.direction - not bad but not good either.score - dismal.overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won't have a career soon enough.3/10.

one of my favorite "bum" actors, c. tom howell, stars in this tepid remake of wotw. he runs around a lot, while a cgi-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. the budget for this one obviously was pretty low. it also was one of the asylum productions. have you seen any of those? yikes! i am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. and if truth be told, neither version is all that hot. the george pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the h.g. wells novel, primitive special effects and all. perhaps because gene barry was much more convincing in the lead than howell or tom cruise.

it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good; hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. very good. actually, it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a bravura performance.the acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. the fault was, in part let us be fair, that the plot bore as much resemblance to the hg wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor. but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the colander "my, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes", unless, that is, holes are your bag; in which case this film will commend itself to you.the fault in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, dvd actors who knew full well, one assumes, that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the $5 dvd shelf. and overpriced at that.so should you watch it? why yes, of course, you should. you are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.

my paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the dvd box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying.this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember. my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version. the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.but as the film wore on, we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing, trite writing, and crude special effects. we gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly, it couldn't possibly get better.since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics, here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments, even if they amount to spoilers:- the lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother, the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. the son asks, quietly worried, "will i ever see you again?" perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition, but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation.- a huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. a crowd of people stands nearby, peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. one woman finally says "it's gi-normous!"- after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a bystander, now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, have an exchange something like this, in a quietly puzzled tone:"what was that thing, anyway?" "i dunno..."- a crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it, the crowd starts to run away, seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger, let alone unusual circumstances.and so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. but please, please, save yourself the bother, even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! the film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus, say, king vidor's "solomon & sheeba" starring yul brynner wearing a wig). life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. there must be something more productive and enjoyable to do, like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage.

this movie is so bad they should burn the master. you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one. the graphics are less than fake, they're horrendous. then you've got the rambling through the countryside star gazer work-a-holic who bounces between his own lunacy & the mad rantings of the crazed preacher. & when he finally makes it to dc, they don't even have the decency to kill him; the monster (which you don't know at the time) is already dieing but how ... who knows & of course it has the ultimate sappy ending... everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family & a handful of stragglers survive. imagine that! this will be the movie that c thomas howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in. it probably gives him nightmares.

after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters, i was hooked on the topic. i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie, people getting vaporized, people panicking, fire, explosions, it was all so great...so a few weeks later i enter my video store, and i see david michael latt's version of war of the worlds on the shelf. "it couldn't have come onto dvd, that fast, could it?" i said to myself. i read the back of the case and saw c. thomas howell, instead. "oh, i remember him from the outsiders!" so i thought, it might have been a try.i was wrong, dead wrong. as soon as i watched the opening credits, watched them take forever, i knew something was wrong. something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did. the whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. from the acting, the special effects (stupid looking tripod things, when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version, in fact, the plot was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! what the crap? i ended up being so bored, that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting. and nothing was really.my advice: don't even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month, buy that one! but please, please, i beg of you! stay away from this turd before it smothers us all!

this movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. it made no sense! it was well acted, but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. the alien machines were created with pentium i technology and no creativity, they were crabs! the under-lit and barely seen aliens were frisbees with legs. where were the tripods? the editing, done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper latt, jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated numerous times. most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane katrina. the next time latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! that doesn't include the writing, editing, directing or visual effects credits on other movies. if the rest are like this snot-load, then he's just making fun of us. this was a slapped together rip-off of spielberg's movie, nothing more. i'm looking forward to latt's "backbroke ridge', "x-man iiv", "the hillocks have eyes."

i wish i could have given this a zero. sure i'll admit that i also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the spielberg version. a clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and being prominently displayed at the video store. however, i was willing to give it a go anyhow - i wish i wouldn't have.where do i start? i have read some of the other reviews here and have to say i disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good - sorry even c. thomas howell stunk. none of the performances were any good. not a one.even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible! "ginormus" and "dick skinners" just doesn't really cut it.now as for the story well - it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old. the main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient - or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together. for example he is trying to get to a place called new hope to find his brother. during a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to new hope. what the hell is that? when he gets to new hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother. then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in. he was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was? he has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. there are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse yet dusk of the next day. i also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason - we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house. which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice. what the hell, the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? there is one point where an alien kills a random citizen, supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him - but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face. the special effects in general are terrible. the entire movie is like a bad "train wreck". when we finally get to the end, after this guy trying to get to dc to find his family, they just appear. no searching no asking questions nothing. just oh there you are i am so happy - the end.i am sorry if my review rambles a bit but this movie was so bad i had a hard organizing my contempt. please save yourself the time and don't watch this sneakily displayed pile of cinematic stench. it is quite possibly the worst film i have ever witnessed. i would rather have been getting a root canal - it would have been less painful.

i am not a big fan of the spielberg/cruise version of this film. and so i must throw in with the more humble latt/howel version. c thomas howel had more heart and more sympathy that cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars. there would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no cruise. because i doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the david michael latt version. so, comparing apples to turnips i guess i have to go with the turnips. at least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market.

h.g. wells' war of the worlds by director david michael latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $1 million. for this budget, the production value wasn't too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget) and sound design. the less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best (but again i think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (again it's because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. however, again, i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. still you should,d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.

while it has been many decades since i last read mr. wells "war of the worlds", or "the time machine", or any other of his works, i believe that they were all set in london, or at least, in england. this grade "b" ("c"?) movie is set in the eastern part of the united states as was orson welles excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. however, this film exhibits none of the quality of the narrative style of the mercury playhouse program. thomas howell's emoting would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. i was actually embarrassed for him. his rolling around in the grass on the hill crying "my family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to the death of his brother. of the three film versions of the story that i have seen, this was by far the worst, with gene barry's 1950's version the best. additionaally, this was the first time i ever saw a "machine monster" dripping sticky saliva such as did the creature in the "alien".

i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie. i think the director filmed it in his back yard! there was no real plot. terrible script.terrible acting.the worst production i have ever witnessed. a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard.i don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one.life is to short to waste your time with this movie!

spoilers****this is tenchi?this is not tenchi.practically everyone is written horribly out of character ... when it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between ayeka and ryoko.also, the villainess is not punished for her actions, which amount to mind-control rape. if a male villain had done to one of the women what haruna does to tenchi, then he would have (rightfully so) painfully bought it at the end of the movie, dying horribly, and the audience would have cheered. but not only does haruna pay no price for her crimes, ryoko actually forgives and understands her actions. no! the real ryoko would have disintegrated her for what haruna had done to her beloved tenchi; the audience i saw this with, myself included, all booed audibly at this sceneanime fans, avoid this movie. tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.

"tenchi muyo in love 2" is the third tenchi movie. it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one. at the risk of giving out spoilers, tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back. nothing new there. a past love of yosho's is the bad guy. that was done in the second movie. the battle between aeka and ryoko and is starting to get boring. the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy. i personally don't know what aic, it's makers, were thinking. i gave this movie a vote of 4.

there were but two reasons for me to see this film. first of all stellan skarsgard and marisa tomei were in it (who are both good actors) and i had nothing better to do. while seeing the film though, i immediately thought of something better to do: sleep! this film is a complete waste of time. it is a standard ex-cop flick. the ex-copper is the best there ever was, but he was fired. he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day. all big surprises (not!!!). go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one.4 out of 10

the perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie:1. take one burnt-out, rogue ex-cop with a bad attitude, yet a sensitive touch as well (closet concert pianist with a pet cat);2. add some "cool" retro gadgets like a beat-up porsche 356, a roaring bike, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles;3. mix in a couple of "free-spirit" locations e.g. a trendy sea-side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office;4. spice it up with "deep" socio-romantic themes such as a post-divorce-traumatized-but-finally-remarrying-ex-wife, a secretly-admiring-and-therefore-forgiving-waitress, a pair-of-former-colleague-cops-only-one-of-whom-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-buddy-getting-iced-over-a-suitcase-full-of-illegal-$$$;5. let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a "fast-paced" though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes, cheap tender moments and sluggish wise-cracks;6. serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do!).

wow...reading through these comments, i see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the us and ... the dutch! the us p.o.v. appears to be that this is quite a good little movie, parker being a likable hero, the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality.all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems. they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster.far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically. still, based on factual observation - i saw the movie with my very own eyes - i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark: "parker kane" is poorly made, utterly boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation.

poor old robert taylor. other than the feds, nothing much has gone his way - this almost-shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more. it's one of those cheesy detective-crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through - usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously! a pity; australian films, particularly in the 2000-01 periods, have been of exceptional quality overall - but i suppose there have got to be a few misses. why even make a film like this, that obviously isn't going to be any good?

the funniest thing about fortunes is that one of the main characters, lewis (urbaniak) has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film. this is sad, as well, as i guess by large, this is supposed to be a comedy, or dramedy, but that's the funniest thing i can remember from watching this.three friends go out and drink one night. on the way home, two decide to get their fortunes told by a "gypsy," as they call her. those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. then, nothing happens.i hope i didn't spoil the movie there, but really, this extremely low-budget, bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell. yeah, i'm being harsh. honestly, it wasn't that bad, it was just blah.the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch, though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines. the clichéd "ladies man," the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. the only bright spot, was the remaining friend, the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. he was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. unfortunately, that's not saying much.perhaps i'm being too cruel. heck, they got the ambition to make a movie, went and got funding and accomplished something. unfortunately, however, i can't at all recommend the film on the basis, there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions. this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes.

this is just a very bad film. miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden. it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all. one of the worst films that i have ever seen!

la ragazza del vagone letto, or terror express! as it was called on the version i saw, starts as various passengers board a long distance train. three thuggish idiots, dave, phil & ernie (carlo de mejo) board & it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate & verbally abuse the other passengers & staff. as the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named juliette (silvia dionisio) refuses to have sex with dave, he & his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with juliette &, well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop & his prisoner who set about saving the day. erm, that's it really...this italian production was directed by ferdinando baldi & is complete total & utter crap from start to finish. the script by george eastman as luigi montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror/thriller. it is tediously slow, it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens & as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that italian sleaze & horror was delivering at that time. the film can be compared to another italian production the infinitely better the house on the edge of the park (1980) made the same year, it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made the house on the edge of the park the notorious film that it is is absent from la ragazza del vagone letto, there's no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there's only a couple of really tame rapes, the story has no twists or turns & as it's incredibly boring to watch. italian sleaze & horror from the late 70's & early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottom-of-the-barrel on all counts. the character's are awful, the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up & giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten & comes to absolutely nothing. i hated the lame ending as well & i don't know if i missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? i don't think there was, was there? i'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason, surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial & interesting if not more plausible. in my opinion this film stinks, it's as simple & straight forward as that i'm afraid.director baldi does an ok job, to be fair he only has one corridor & a few train compartments to work with so i'll cut him some slack, having said that the film does become very repetitive. there is no style & he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music. there is not one single drop of blood spilt in the entire film, that's right not one single drop. forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do, like i did. there are a couple of rapes but they're amateurishly staged & have zero impact, the nasty exploitation & sleaze of say i spit on your grave (1978) or the last house on the left (1972) is not here.technically la ragazza del vagone letto is ok & it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum. the acting is poor as usual, although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost. fans of italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices here.la ragazza del vagone letto is a terrible film, it's just my opinion but i was bored to tears waiting for something to happen & when it eventually never i felt cheated, i want those 80 minutes of my life back. this piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the 99p vhs bargain bin in your local blockbuster, one to avoid.

i've got to say, i'm a big fan of these 'last house on the left' rip-offs, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that i didn't like much was aldo lado's 'night train murders', and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the last house on the left don't mix, as terror express is another lacklustre rip-off. something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while terror express offers up three potential candidates, not one of them steps up and becomes this villain, leaving the lacking in the most important area. it actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. this leads the audience to believe that there is more in store, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. from there, the trio end up 'taking over' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.it has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there's hardly any blood. director ferdinando baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. the idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time, and despite one very tame 'sandwich' sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. films like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you. as you might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. the direction is lacking in style, and there's very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen. overall, this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film, and i can't recommend it.

the unpleasant "home invasion" genre can be traced back to wes craven's early sleazefest "last house on the left", with such nasty off-shoots as "i spit on your grave", "wrong way" and "the visitors" soon following in the footsteps of that film. here, in this early '80s italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once more, with the twist being that this one is set on a continental train. "la ragazza del vagone letto"  known in english-speaking countries as "terror express"  starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse, as the sex scenes start to gain precedence over the more serious action and suspense.david, phil and ernie, three rich youths who wallow in terrorising and humiliating others, board a trans-continental express in italy. the train is full of other passengers, among them prostitute juliette (silvia dionisio) who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp, persuading the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping compartment. the three cretins quickly set about upsetting the passengers with their aggressive, drunken behaviour, but matters get more serious when they seize control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves in from the rest of the train. pretty soon, they are revelling in their temporary control. a young wife (zora kerova) is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment; juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault; and later the odious trio force the male passengers to role a dice in order to decide which one will rape a 16 year old virgin travelling with her parents (a concept made doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game). the only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being escorted to germany, but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs? la ragazza del vagone letto gets off to a decent start. various intriguing characters are introduced, and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers. though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation, the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual gutter-level of its genre. things fall apart during a horrid scene in which kerova is sex-sandwiched in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs. the scene is gloatingly filmed, and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators instead, we are being asked to feel turned on. this is sensationalism at its worst. further humiliating rapes follow, but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of oral sex and the female genitalia. one sequence featuring the 16 year old girl teeters on the brink of hard core and feels particularly "wrong". by the end of la ragazza del vagone letto it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller, for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense. lovers of sleaze will revel in it; others might want to look elsewhere.

another sadistic and ultra-sleazy late 70's/early 80's revenge movie?? wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his "last house on the left" although "terror express" is more like a rip-off of other rip-offs, like "i spit on your grave" and especially "night train murders". storywise, this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleaze-factor by a thousand! this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending. on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok. they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females. things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three. this is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood. this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women, but the sex in "terror express" isn't unsettling at all. on the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves! the music is great, the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld. the villains are wimps and the train-passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set. if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets, this is your film. however, your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled. "terror express" should be in the porn-section of videostores.

yet another cookie-cutter movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable, street-smart kid (cop and 1/2, gloria, etc). and once again, it is not funny or interesting, for anyone to watch - kids or adults. i'm sure some people might find this movie amusing, but i have no earthly idea why. once again, i feel sorry for the poor kids who were forced to work in this movie, so that everyone else and their parents could make some bucks at the price of a cheesy cheesy movie.

this movie has got to be one of the all-time lows of michael j. fox's generally respectable career. i should have known how awful this movie was when i rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter. never a good sign! fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids. his character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being mikey. his big break comes when he meets angie vega, a talented child. vega is abrasive and not at all likeable. in fact, the only likeable character in the whole movie is cyndi lauper as a brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency. one of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it note to the box warning others not to waste their time!

this movie was so incredibly boring, michael j. fox could've done so much better. sorry, but it's true for all you people who liked the movie

well, this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be. i was expecting to give it one star. i chose to give it three. why? well, for a cheesy horror/sci-fi movie, it's not all that bad. sure the characters are tacky (as is their acting - including a young leonardo dicaprio), the effects cheap looking, and the monsters...well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools... but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end. a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess. and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas, this movie will let you live your dream. 3/10

i didn't particularly like sliding doors or twice upon a yesterday, so i certainly didn't this poor second-rate excuse for those films. an idea that's been done to death (what would happen if...?) and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex/nudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries (i really don't need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm. especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film).the acting was also very poor, the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter; the rest were two-dimensional and quite unbelievable. the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through; i managed to finish it, but not without fast forwarding through part of it.overall: nothing new here, it's a generic and boring film. the few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones. this would be dull even if it hadn't been done before. if it weren't such a rehash i'd rate it a five, but even for an indie film this was severely lacking, and as a rehash it loses on originality as well: 3/10.

what a mess of a movie! if it wasnt for eric roberts and susan sarandon's performances ,this movie would be a total waste! a very muddled plot and phony dialogue.eric roberts debut....where did his career go from this movie on?nowhere but down!

when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about, i felt very curious. but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life. technically speaking, the sound is poor, you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix. secondo of all, the photography is mediocre, some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the cinematographer achieves that "dark night" is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights, there's no reference used of the moonlight, my god! thir but not least, most of the ac tings are really poor, it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier, her performance it's pretty poor.great disappointing, shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on the oscars.

tom is about to tuck into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack. not at all happy with having his sarnie stolen right from under his nose, tom takes off in hot pursuit, determined to retrieve his mousy morsel.as much as i love tom and jerry, i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker: the story is rather mundane; it introduces a badly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm; and it flogs the old 'dress the cartoon character up as a woman' gag to death.in my opinion, 'flirty birdy' rivals 'fraidy cat' and 'mouse in manhattan' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far.

this year's eurovision was to me a big disappointment. i've watched the eurovision song contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the earliest one i can remember, and i was only 2 at the time). as any other year this one contained both good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. however this year's show was the worst one i can remember. only very few good (decent's probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs.turkey's winner song "every way that i can" sounded to me like a rip-off of turkish singer tarkan's hit "simarik", just sounding a lot worse. it didn't deserve to win from my point of view. belgium's song "sanomi", coming in second, was a no-language song. wonder what's next? animals singing? nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling, to which the "lyrics" seemed appropriate. one of the better songs, but that's not saying much.after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo t.a.t.u. ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium, with "ne ver', ne boisia" ("don't trust, don't be afraid"). to me t.a.t.u. was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants. they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well indeed.the biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was austria. the bookmakers here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song - a song that indeed was beyond horrible - but ended up in 8th place. could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun.sweden did what they do the best; abba. in 1999 they won with "take me to your heaven", by sounding like abba. in 2001 they made the top 10 with "listen to your heartbeat", again sounding like abba, and once again this year they did it abba-style, again ending in the top 10.england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible, non-catching songs, that they've been the past years.ireland ripped off the winner from 2000, "fly on the wings of love". and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were.i feel a bit sorry for the aussies, who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest. they deserved better than this.i wasn't surprised by the show though. the eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was okay, but certainly no more. this year was quite simply disappointing.let's hope it'll get better next year. if not for us, then at least for the aussies.4/10. one for t.a.t.u., one for the close race, one for the butt-shaking and one for all the rest.

the acting is generally pretty weak. the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming, so it just doesn't come across well. what do you want for a tv movie?annette o'toole was ok; there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen.otherwise, these kids weren't quite up to it. didn't impress my kids either.on the upside, it is only an hour long. considering that, it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion. the settings and cinematography are ok too.some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons.

i have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new (2007) version of bridge to teribithia. after, i went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. i must say that i was extremely disappointed! i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying, "i know daddy, but i hurt so much inside" after leslie dies. it was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion. i watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. the story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of teribithia.

i was in 6th grade and this movie aired on pbs during a series called 'wonderworks.' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. in the film jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie. due to a very simple, but careless mistake one of the pair dies. at the time, i found the story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues.last year, i finally tracked down a vhs copy of the show. i probably should have stuck with my memories. watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was. my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well, and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact, and avoid seeing this film as an adult.

i am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. they laughed out loud! unfortunately, it's not a comedy! the acting was so awful, i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play. my students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. i have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. still, i would show it to students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. we did a venn diagram (teachers know what that is) afterward, to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better!

i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies. there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice. so i was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good. boy was i wrong! the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie. fist off the good, what little there is... the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good, though with notable exceptions. character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. now for the bad... unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both iron man's origin and especially the mandarin's. on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi. bad cgi. this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon. the cg work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times. the cg battles are clumsy as well, further enhancing the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well. the movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually draw all the characters. another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle! and its not even the big fight at the end. all this drags the movie down and it never picks up.************ spoilers (or warnings) may follow ************the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery, welding and gears. then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the mandarin. things go strangely, impeding progress in restoring the temple. overseeing it is james rhodes, tony stark's long time friend. seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth, despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster. rhodes is captured in a raid. stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed. tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces. tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. he is saved only by quick action from rhodes and a scientist. eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape, but only after some loss of life. while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li mei, and the two fall in love. the temple is raised and four elemental beings (all done in cg) appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power. stark and rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them, first using the aquatic armor, then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be fin fang foom (also in cg.) here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the mandarin needs a host body to manifest. this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh...if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing. and even non-fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not.

this was something i had been looking forward to seeing. the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title. but the final film was unsatisfying. i wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor. the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box. the worse thing however was the story, the acting and the cell-shaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing. it didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all. even on it's own it seem stick-like and lifeless. tony stark's character arc, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing. i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldn't have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies.

i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time. first off, the plot was uninspired... at least. the animation was even worse, we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a shinier version of g.i.joe. i won't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs. or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines (?!??!?!). where were we? oh yeah the performance, well it was totally flat, lacking passion and talent if i am excused. now as for the dialogs, just like the acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that someone wouldn't expect. let's just hope the movie will be decent ...at least.

don't get me wrong, the guy's a success dynamo, but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market.see, "the invincible iron man" wouldn't be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward undiscerning children. but it's not directed exclusively at children. periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi-nude bodies to make network censors squirm, so it isn't quite cut out for children's television.so what audience is this video aiming for then? it's the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings, that's who. and i think that audience is restrictively small.a lot of great writers have passed through marvel's leathery yoni over the decades. so it's a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like mr. arad, are better accustomed to peddling action figures during saturday morning cartoons. how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy? ***animation: just passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget look all throughout -- this ain't no bakshi (ralph) and it ain't no bluth (don)! cg animation's okay, but far from impressive.story: a litany of clichés, all over the place, convoluted, contrived, and uninspired.characters: so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to stark's sexual ambiguity? hmmm... her dad's in a wheelchair... tony misses his mom... asian chicks are hot and, apparently, little else; the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the feature's end.performances: can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script.art: very western musculature, very clean lines, faces are very derivative of eastern art, very boring mattes, very bland cg.conclusion: not great, but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. a 'must-buy' for collectors. a valuable "what not to do" course for junior animators.

first of all, the title "daily" is a lie. every "daily show" program opens with an on-screen visual of the date it was made, followed by a pause and the opening announce. on the many days when they are re-running a daily show, they slip-cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one. that's a lie. there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast. and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is. furthermore, it's only on 4 nights a week. that's not quite "daily" - meaning monday through friday - another shortcoming but one i am grateful for.it's sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often only, news source. this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse - badly misinformed.although it leans liberal-left, politically, this show can be amusing at times. however, its veracity is low. facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers' agendas. it's often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin. the result is pre-digested, reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. this is called "propaganda".the remote interviews are heavily kluged in editing.it really loses me when it bashes god and christians - which it does all too often. however, you'll never hear anything vaguely anti-semitic.if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. the names in the credits explain the source.

jon stewart (aka john liebowitz) constantly rips conservatism and anything republican. this liberal comic is anything but, as he pours his cutting "humor" down the throats of impressionable youths. i've viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy borders on treason. he'll take al queda's side over bush any day. he's shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a phony laughtrack. i do remember four years ago when he "interviewed" john kerry. the two made faces at each other that seemed to preclude a makeout session. it was like, "get a room, you guys". i just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda. call me shallow. the daily show has had a long run and there are many likeminded liberals who have a seething hatred for republicans and conservatism. i'm not surprised at its success, but do that many people actually watch comedy central? that mancia guy makes me barf.

comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. but even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile. when i look at the daily show, i see the whole "it's funny because it's true" thing, but i don't, however, see the effort and often times i don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point(i notice this mostly in the interview segments). the daily show started off as a news parody, by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then jon stewart came along...and it all went to hell. thr first years of jon stewart's reign were arguably golden, i though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on. the show's humor has gone stale, colbert left, steve carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about jon stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially evening news but with some gags here and there. for those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable, i'll give you a brief description of what the show's about(at least until 2009): -bush, cheney and all republicans(unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and a hypocrite; -people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; -vote democrat; there, i saved you 25 minutes of your time, go watch something else. at first, i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but when i actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show's about(what i mentioned above), but i'll get to that in a moment. frist off, the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush, cheney or a random republican humorous because well, because. jon sets up the joke, setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline. so, unless you «get» the context, it's entirely useless as bankable humor. also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing, again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand, thus making it funny,why? well, because jon said so. now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh-fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares(yes, even in the lewis black segments). at first, some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i've ever seen. jon stewart calls bill o'reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat(john kerry before, obama today) that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standard's own bill kristol? he puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime, often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america, that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative, unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats, if so then's it's an endless love fest. but still, it doesn't matter, in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords. that's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right-wing. now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor. one wonders what'll happen if democrats win the white house...

i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor.the reason, to mention one thing, is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the republicans have done. in short it is basically democratic party political opinions touted as humor.all mr. stewart does is wisecrack about anything the republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughter.my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate republicans.-ld_____________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this show has shown it's true colors now that democrats are in power. it never did lead the world in iq as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been programmed to think one way (which is a scary thing).comedy central moved this & it's spin off back to an earlier time once the democrats took power for a reason- because now when the democrats screw up - which is just as often as republicans do - stewart no longer takes pot shots at them. that is why the ratings for both this & the spin are dropping.basically, most of the humor now is either lame, or lame sarah palin jokes - which all the ratings dropping comedians are now telling. the facts to back this up speak for themselves. the jay leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled. the ratings for letterman & conan & the shows that follow them are down.so emperor stewart is not alone. trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling democrats in power, they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power. the bush years proved that because the ratings for this show & colbert, & letterman & leno were higher there.o'bama has done one thing, proved these shows have to be willing to take chances & rip the folks in power if they are to prosper. right now, the daily show & stewart are sagging but maybe they can get lucky & have palin elected as the first woman president in 2012. then the lame palin jokes will become ratings grabbers.

for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family. all of us hated it with a passion. it's a nice enough kids' movie, maybe in the year it came out. however, think about it: an outdated kids' movie? what's the point? kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway, and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.some kids' movies (like mary poppins or wizard of oz) can be enjoyed even now, but time bandits is totally outdated. for your reference, and i think applicable in this case, i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all. so, if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like time bandits.there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the 'bad guys'. think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the pirates of the c. movies, except in time bandits they are not even remotely funny.anyway, i warned you, that's all i can do. people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago. if you have not seen it before, then don't bother watching it now.

i got this movie from the library, and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it(john cleese, ian holm, ralph richardson, etc), so i got it and watched it. i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing, i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else i liked. this movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen. there were a few funny parts, but that's about it. stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going "what?" and "huh?", a lot. and if you don't want to waste your time. ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie...it isn't. just stay away from it at all costs...please.

i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. what was the movie about? what is it a spoof? fantasy? comedy? satire? no answer there from gilliam's screenplay. totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. roger ebert has it right in his review. the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue. the movie also tries to confuse the would-be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing.

i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. and in my opinion this movie lacks heart. i frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. honestly, while i didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, i did remorse the lost time on the sad little film.i have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly i didn't.

well.....horror this ain't, but.......!!!??? a terrible low low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind, sort of and...therefore quite charming and funny to watch...at least on my tv set!!! a cross between pete walker, herschell gordon lewis and...say....damn, i give up...just can't come up with any "prettier" resemblances for this trashy movie. everything is soooo wrong that i just have to enlist it in my film collection alongside with....death in venice.....nekromantik.....blue velvet and the good,bad,ugly... right !!?? people with some small talent for adding gory inserts or sexy happenings to film they buy offa other people, should pick this film up immediately....sure is a fat lil' ol' goldmine waiting here, oh maaaannnn!!!!!

i went into this film expecting/hoping for a sleazy drive-in style slice of seventies exploitation, but what i got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action. it's clear that this film was made on a budget; the locations are drab and poorly shot, while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also. the plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) that steal a load of gold after killing some miners. they come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother...and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl, currently residing in an asylum. it's clear that directors louis leahman and william sachs thought they were making something really shocking; but despite its best efforts, south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. the film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long-winded dialogue. the only good thing i have to say about the film is with regards to the music; which is good in places. the ending is the only other good thing about the movie; and that's only because it's the last thing that happens. i wouldn't recommend anyone bothers tracking this down...there was much better trash made in the seventies.

an absolutely baffling western featuring flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum, south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at cannon film. co-directed by william sachs, who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina, the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren't worth discovering. the cast (most of whom never made another film) try gamely, but are hamstrung by the screenplay, which generally makes no sense. the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. ultimately, it's a lot of talk and little else.

maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end. that's odd, because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night's dream once, many years ago, when i saw it on the stage. i think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name, calista flockhart, and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. well, i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....

newly released on dvd in the us; just stay far away from it.i usually give plenty of room for stupidity in horror films; i'll settle for nearly anything remotely suspenseful, supernatural, spooky, or even just a vaguely interesting concept. this one simply stank. i knew there was trouble when sara's "best friend" in college, who had considerable screen time, wasn't even listed in the credits on imdb! i wasn't surprised not recognizing any actors, but that character ("daysha" or "day-glo" or whatever her name was) apparently didn't even exist! i'm so embarrassed that i actually paid a rental fee for this garbage; deeply, deeply ashamed...

i know a couple people who look just like the lead actress in this film (or, at least, like the character she portrays.) they all give me the creeps and i would be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. she has one mean and ugly-looking expression. if you can conjure up a bit of sympathy for her, let me know.of course, i might have the same expressions of concern and fear if i had an imaginary friend who had been killing off my real friends and acquaintances for the last 15 years.and for our european friends on the imdb, i'm saddened to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the us teach courses on paranormal phenomena, relying on the pathetic defense that it represents "academic freedom" and open inquiry.this film is not worth your while. you will have no sympathy for any of the characters (except for aunt lydia, who gets offed pretty early) and the plot makes no sense.

bad plot, bad acting, bad direction.it had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything.this film looks like someone started with an idea, googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music.others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way through - i had to take a break purely because i just didn't care anymore.reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with marginally more suspense.just bad.

the film starts well enough. it is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father. the young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre, who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard. then, we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug-addled student researching the supernatural, living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead. she has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no-one else can see. so yep, life is grand. things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mum's sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead. hmm, i wonder who the police's main suspect will be? this is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing. could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature? clue: if you think the former, you've picked up the wrong movie from blockbuster. go back and get the correct one, short-sighted gimp.as i said, i was all ready to fast-forward to the good parts, safe in the knowledge that i wasn't missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler. but the first ten minutes grabbed me, and i decided to give it a chance. i was quite pleasantly surprised: it certainly wasn't a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which i looked forward to finding the solution to. alas, 45 minutes in, i realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library, doing nothing. we then get a cheap scare, followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend. things only got worse from there, as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another, followed by an ending so anti-climatic it's like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead. pathetic.if it was bad all the way through, it would have been far easier to swallow. the fact that it starts at a canter and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing, it is heartbreaking. how can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic? i don't know, and i don't particularly care. i'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time: don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay, then 5 minutes finishing the rest. you tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here... 3/10

wow, what a bad film. not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible. the plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling. what's that line from a famous critic? "she runs the emotional gamut from a to b." yup. that about sums it up. not even good for camp value! i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this? and gosh, her friend's a ghost? you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.this film (and i use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public. if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative! this gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower. on the bright side--at least it's not a full two hours long.

well this was a complete waste of celluloid. the preview was promising but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview *was* the whole movie. no plot, no clear storyline, just some misplaced suspense. it looks like the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystique and fear, but still there are gaps to be filled. why the drugs? why the number 11.11? (btw. as sarah enteres the library, the clock says 11.14) what's the connection to the murder on the parents? what's the role of this rayden woman? is she one of the children or not? who are those children anyway. there is a lot of material lying around to create the ultimate cult movie like "the omen" but the director just leaves them lying on the floor without digging into the story. even "the blairwitch project" was more scary than this one. all the gaps you hope to be filled like in "the butterfly effect" stay open as the credits start rolling.. ok. off to the next movie...

what can be said about such a pathetic movie ? - very bad acting ! the main actress seems to know only one facial expression : fear mixed with weakness. like a poor beaten dog... the other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne, with an awful red wig. the other actors are so pitiful that they don't even worth being described. - there's absolutely no plot. the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere : we don't know anything about the meaning of "11:11", nor who rayden really is, excepted the simple "she's evil" or "she's a child of apocalypse"... which is not an explanation. we don't know why the parents have been killed, what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen. as the film goes on, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes, with a bad music. moreover, the end doesn't tell anything : we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut... there's no plot, so no possible interpretation. - "11:11" is just full of clichés ! it is so obvious that i couldn't help laughing. for example : the deserted library or the bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind, ... there's even the fashionable "little scary girl" as in "dark water" or "the ring". of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). is it an obligation to make her credible ? i don't think so. the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible, nor endearing.- terrible direction : as i said, nothing original, everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose. - there are some funny incoherences. for example, i don't know if "ghost science", "paranormal course" or whatever is taught in american universities... in europe it is really not the case : teachers talking about negative energies or using "unmaterial" creatures sensors... ridiculous. also : how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization (in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen) and how can you, on this old film, isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face ? i wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical film...eventually, "11:11" just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch... but it's an expensive way to fall asleep !

first of all, this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it, since i myself did not understand this horrible story. further, the unknown cast, leaded by an actress called laura mennell, is simply awful. the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with acting. last but not the least, there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows:- top notch- can't wait to see more of the directors work  the author has only one review in imdb on 24 september 2004;- incredibly shot, amazingly intense  the author has only one review in imdb on 12 august 2004; - not your typical blood and gore, in fact better. 7/10  the author has only one review in imdb on 13 february 2005;- as intense as asian horror!! - the author has only one review in imdb on 14 november 2004.coincidence? or are they the parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap? my vote is three.title (brazil): "11.11  a nova profecia" ("11.11  the new prophecy")

11:11 a.k.a. hell's gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. a young girl has an imaginary play mate. one day whilst out in the fields playing with her friends, a couple of fugitives visit her parents and whack them off for no apparent reason. the young girl runs off and hides from the bad men. years later, the girl grows up into a woman with problems. losers at her school (looking like repressed homosexuals) flaunt their manhood in front of her when she rejected one of them. the girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. a secret from her past returns to visit her. who or what is it? why does everyone hate her? what's her guardian's problem with her? to find out you'll have to watch hell's gate.the new title makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. i don't know why people are given money to make such bad movies. this film is not even good enough to make fun of. it's a head ache inducing mess that'l confuse anyone who tries to make some sense out of it. not worth your time.not recommended.

the only entertaining thing that i found about watching this movie was listening to star wars coming through the wall of the movie theatre (yes i go to a really bad movie theatre). this movie is so mind numbingly bad that i think i would rather have my eyes scratched out by a cat rather than watch it again.let's compare it to the original. one is charming, funny, exciting, well acted, and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your eyeballs will fall out so you don't have to watch any more. i'm sorry christina ricci is a fine actress but cannot compare with hailley mills, and don't even get me started on doug e. doug in a part one occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming dean jones. dean jones' tiny part in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie, and it is the only reason i can justify a 1* rating (also because the imdb doesn't go into negatives).

i am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). it is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. i never thought i could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of uhf, but this was it. and just when you think it can't possibly get any worse, it does! over and over again! you actually could have watched this in a theater? it wasn't worth free on tv! my 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked it some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.

i saw this movie just recently, and i said to myself: "this movie is bad!" william shatner is a great actor, but he is no director! it's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. and instead of a plot, we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot! what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing "row, row, row your boat!"do i have something against william shatner? i do not. but when it comes to being a director, he sucks! this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen. but it is the worst of the star trek series! i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series. they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened! overall, this movie sucks! 2/10

man, this would have been a bad episode of the original series. i can't believe they actually spent money on this one... i caught the second half of this on tv and, having never seen this one before, thought i would watch it... boy, what a waste of time... more cheese than wisconsin!!!

star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series. despite the good acting efforts by the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures. paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset.the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the earth from total ecological disaster. their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on nimbus iii, the planet of intergalactic peace. captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at nimbus iii only to have their ship hijacked by sybok, spock's half-brother. sybok brainwashes the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with "god" just past the great barrier at the center of our galaxy. captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the enterprise's klignon pursuers.the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing. william shatner, leonard nimoy, deforest kelley, laurence luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances. william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film.however, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. first, the part of sybok was initially offered to sean connery, but he refused. so, laurence luckinbill got the part. second, many of the special effects were severely cut back ... reducing the movies entertaining potential. third, the scene that depicts the arrival at the great barrier left much to be desired. finally, the romance between scotty and uhura in this film did not make much sense at all ... considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between star treks iv and v.overall, this is a very weak film. you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek vi. after all, the cast and crew made star trek vi partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with star trek v.

no one expects the star trek movies to be high art, but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. unfortunately, this movie had a muddled, implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with kirk, spock and mccoy at yosemite.i would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.

i'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. i'm aware that the idea of 'searching for god' might appear interesting to some, to me, however, it's really boring.the movie is simply boring. when it does get a little bit interesting, it gets stupid. come on... kirk fights against god and wins? how low can we possibly get? the only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes, which is truly great, but after that, the movie becomes boring, irritating, with nothing more than a good music.thank god we have star trek vi. (oops, kirk beat him).

i don't think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film. however, i can offer a small recollection from seeing st-v in the theater. in the last (dreadful) scene, as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second, the audience seemed to rise in unison. normally, for a movie like this, at least -some- die-hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer. as the people filed out, i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter, only low murmurs.i remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it. what an idiot. the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first!favorite worst scene: target shooting on a voyager space probe, through a periscope no less! space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought.

while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring, star trek the final frontier is plain bad. in this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth, romulus and kronos (the klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner. when he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "row row row your boat" in a round by a campfire. in any case, this is the worst of the star trek franchise. i should have given it three out of ten instead of five.

even not being a fan of the "star trek" movies or universe of shows and books and such, i still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of "first contact" even the new cast a bit. this one though was kind of sad to watch...it seemed to want to be so much, but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst star trek movies. the plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate trek adventure, but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be, not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies. the whole movie to take a phrase from spock is illogical. the effects are nothing special as i have seen episodes of next generation that are just as good, which is to say it is fine for a television show, but not a major motion picture. the plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find god, yes you read that correctly. the klingons make a tacked on appearance, which actually will set up the much better undiscovered country movie. all in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is kirk, bones and spock singing row your boat, well spock was not really singing, but rather questioning the lyrics.

leonard nimoy directed star trek iii, which wasn't half bad. maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could. after seeing this film he should have reversed that decision.star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series. the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition. if they meant to make her look sexy. they were wrong. she looked grotesque.how this got to production or even written...well it dosen't bear thinking about. the only place good for this film is in the garbage. the worst one of the series.

when i first saw it 9 years ago, when i was 9. i thought it stunk. i'm 18 now and i still think it stinks. i mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climatic. my cousin watched once and george takai (sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they kept cutting to the budget. it would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.

supposedly, director william shatner had in mind a much 'darker' film when it came to 'star trek v: the final frontier' but the suits at paramount, looking at the huge box-office receipts taken in by its humor-filled predecessor, insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too. so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast. there are bad ideas aplenty, along with a few good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'the final frontier' the same way you would a so-so episode of the tv series. on the plus side, laurence luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best 'guest star' performances in any star trek, big or small screen, ranking right up there with william windom's commodore decker. his portrayal of sybok, spock's half-brother, consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too frequently. charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general korrd; too bad his role isn't as large as he is. if the story about shatner's intentions is true, then i owe him an apology, because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet. the reason is i've always felt that, of all the trek regulars, shatner was the least 'tuned-in' to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans. having read his trek memoirs, it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting. he preferred the vision of gene coon over that of gene roddenberry; coon was known for his work on the popular western series, 'the wild wild west.' shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was 'a piece of the action,' a silly second-season episode co-written by coon. so, finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film, would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? well somebody did, because that's what 'the final frontier' ended up being. shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and, as leonard maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'the cutes.' in the opening scene at yosemite national park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue. running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the enterprise have run all the way from 'wrath of khan' and by this, the fifth trek movie, have run themselves into the ground. so has the idea of a 'skeleton crew'. one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two. it's a pointless subplot and adds nothing. the climactic scene where 'god' is encountered doesn't add much either; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (the 'god' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'the search for spock.' leonard nimoy manages to salvage spock's integrity, even while spouting such un-spock-like lines as "get a grip on yourself, doctor." and deforest kelley, as usual, outperforms both shatner and nimoy; he really came on as an actor in the final trek films. so this trek outing isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation,' and it was far better suited to the task than 'star trek v: the final frontier.'

the voyage here is a search for god, the big guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. cunningly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. taking over from leonard nimoy in the directing chair is the shat himself, captain tiberius william shatner kirk. in an attempt at blending the fun corny aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics {klingon dialogue consultant, really?}, shatner and his co-writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. where's the danger,? where's the brothers in arms spirit,? in fact where is our badly underwritten crew?. star trek humour is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace so befitting what has come before the final frontier. some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. while do we really need another spock revelation,? really?.some nice sets and little knowingly trek moments aside, the final frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10

i am speechless, honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this, cast anyone in the film let alone direct it. the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed. i am disappointed in flex alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone essay the role. omg! i think i just insulted the word "essay"...uh yeah i did. y'know what, the less said about this mindless drivel, the better. you have been warned, nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself. watch at your own risk.

the main word that comes to mind when considering this film is "dodgy". this is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. the gloved one deserved better.before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic, i have to say that there are two things i found effective. first was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. i feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was *severely* lacking throughout the rest of the film. second was the sequence depicting the courtship of michael jackson and lisa marie presley. i will not comment on whether i believe the marriage was a sham, but by many accounts, it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved. that really came across in this film; flex anderson and krista rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. these successful points are enough to keep man in the mirror away from 1-star status.that said...there was very little else here that worked. very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, most egregiously those playing elizabeth taylor, janet jackson, and diana ross. also, the absence of jackson's music was a huge loss. how can you effectively tell a story about him without his music?? i understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low-budget, unauthorized production; it seems, though, that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him, you might as well pack it up and go home, because you're missing out on an extremely important part of his life story.this film's characterization of jackson bothered me a little, too. i won't argue that he was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal, but here, he was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled. i don't believe that jackson, known to have been a shrewd businessman, would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as he was made out to be in this film.finally, the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful. many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny, like michael and janet's "tinkerbell" exchange, or nonsensical, like the "blanket of love" comments made by michael. also, the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety. there was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events ("what could possibly go wrong??" sorts of lines) and extremely overt hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if i'd heard the word "believe" one more time...). this is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad.perhaps when we are a few years, or even a decade or three, removed from jackson's death, someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving film. by that time, we might have a better perspective on his life, and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful examination of who michael jackson really was and what he's meant to the world of entertainment. this very dodgy biopic was not that film.

usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, its, at the very least, campy (i.e. cybill shepherd as martha stewart, lauren bacall as doris duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap, and boring television movie ever made. if vh-1 is going to make a television film, they have got to spend a little more money on them. flex alexander--though gifted with the michael voice--is not a great dancer, does not resemble michael one bit, and does not even have his mannerisms down. vh-1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator, that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery, he doesn't actually come out looking exactly the same. why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film? the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her, and don't even get me started on the woman as janet jackson. terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep vh-1 from producing any more movies. flex alexander would have made a much better jermaine jackson rather than michael. costumes? trashy ripoffs. neverland? spliced together footage from news docs. don't bother with this one....its not even remotely worth it. the one good piece of casting--the actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie presley, though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl.

i grabbed la bandara because it reunited jean gabin and julien duvivier, whose pepe le moko is a noir masterpiece. i'll give it a few points because gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, cheap sets and the ludicrous annabella making like an arab princess put the film on my `to sell' shelf. if you watch it, you'll find yourself asking, why didn't the idiots build the fort *around* the well, instead of a deadly few yards away from it. and why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? but by then the sheer perversity of contrivance that makes up the script should numb you to any further contemplation.

not many people outside poland have had an opportunity to become familiar with andrzej sapkowski's brilliant writings. he's very popular in poland for his fantasy short stories ( i believe none of them has ever been translated intrto english. alas!). to make a long story short, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski's books - is a traveling monster slayer, a man of extraordinary strenght and skill: he's pretty much your favourite tolkien-style cool guy. unfortunately, no one would figure this out after watching the film. 'wiedzmin' the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes, featuring wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not eben remotely resembling the plot and dramatic pace of the original. event the fact that some of the shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. the movie gets worse and worse with every minute, and does not even meet the requirements of 'so bad it's actually good' category. if you really are into fantasdy and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.

yes, that's true. that movie is a horrible piece of... you know what. almost all fans of sapkowski's books in poland think the same. the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films. it's a shame when you compare "wiedzmin" and "conan the barbarian" for example. i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare.

a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels. i hope somebody, someday will be able to film it the right way. in the meantime, look for the books (by a. sapkowski), a very inteligent, postmodern fantasy. by now there should be a translation in english, there translations in german for sure.

there are three main problems with the film. or rather there are three reasons why it isn't even a contender worthy of more serious consideration.firstly, and this was always going to be true, it's not nearly as good as the books. however, at least we could have expected to reflect some of the sapkowski's wit or depth.secondly we have the production. fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the hardest to produce well. everything from the props through costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) cgi is substandard.finally, and this is many be very subjective, i just can't quite take the acting seriously. i wasn't brought up in poland so i can't really judge- it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish. all the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered... the casting could be better as well.in summation, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through: not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaver.on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english. i haven't seen them yet but i can't imagine how one would even begin to translate them... i would ask the english-speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book.

brodzki's creation is a great example of how not to make a movie. first there was a book written with a great humor. book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place. then came a script as humorless and full of nonsense as possible. at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot. not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway(ex. "i'm like an ice shard. you can burn yourself" said yennefer as a word of warning - warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks). to add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects one of which is a see-through dragon. even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater. that is the better ones look this way. and to add to that we have a few 'naked scenes' put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot. the movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest - music is not bad. though if i was to choose i'd prefer to have it separately. it sounds better if you don't have to look at this failure of super production.

the movie is simply horrible (2/10). although actors are trying their best (well sometimes that isn't much) special effects are ...let me put it this way it would be better if there weren't any.the script is based on sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. sadly it's the opposite. there is nothing left of the original atmosphere. and it's all very chaotic. maybe they just had too much material to show in 2h time.anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series (same title, same actors, even the plot stays the same) that was made in the same time the movie did. it is so much better (9/10) and the story there actually make sense:)

well, for a start, i must say that, here, in russia, a saga of geralt of rivia is known and loved. andrzej sapkowski - a gifted writer, or, maybe, even genius of some sort - created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and god d@mn well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature. and when such amazing material gets in a right hands well, see rpg game "witcher" and you will understand what i am talking about."vedmak\wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite outcome.lack of budget. lack of directing. lack of good script.these three whales of disgusting movie making sunken this movie, ate it alive. acting is good, sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project. i still have some faith though. i still hope that someday a new vedmak movies will be created and entire world will see magnitude and breathtaking splendor of sapkowski's books. p.s. but before that a uwe boll must be eliminated. just in case, you know

when just days away before the film's premiere, its screenwriter backs out of the project, and demands his name to be removed from the credits, you know that this does not bode well. the books, on which "wiedzmin" is based on, have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film  "geralt de rivia is a witcher; his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world. but not everything monstrous-looking is evil, and not everything fair is good" but all that didn't matter, when a polish film crew, with a low budget, and no, or little appreciation for sapkowski's work, decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. the two-hour film is a by-product of their actions, to maximize the profits. it's not hard to point out in this case, what makes people label this film as bad. plot (incoherent, thanks to cramming it with too many stories), acting (below average, with exception of zebrowski), dialogues (bland), editing (choppy), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), add up to the film's overall bad experience. only the soundtrack, done by grzegorz ciechowski, brings out the beauty of the world of "wiedzmin", which was never brought to the screen. even poland's grandiose flora and fauna (where part of "the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe" was shot), a crucial element in almost any fantasy film, were not used up to their full potential. the more i think about this dead loss, the more i'm running out of words. at least, it's a comfort to know, that marek brodzki, the director of "wiedzmin", has directed only one film ever since (in addition, in germany). for now, we're left with top-notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer rpg (released in 2007) referring to the wiedzmin books. but i'm sure that one day, justice will be done for the wiedzmin saga, and we'll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough.

this movie is trash from the word go. first, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago! who cares? this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap. it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character.swearing doesn't bother me, but i'm still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel. the f-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break.this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. i rate this on the same level as jaws iv - the revenge and everybody wins...2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame.

this movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era! and let's cast brian dennehey as coach bobby knight!" that's where this movie went terribly wrong. why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man he's portraying? and then, why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight, but brian dennehey in a red sweater? as i sat watching this movie on espn, i didn't find myself believing this man was actually coach knight. he didn't look like him, talk like him, act like him, or even walk like him. i could not get past this fact, and thusly, i could not enjoy the movie. when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the outlaws butch cassidy and the sundance kid, we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie. but, with someone as visible in today's media as coach knight, you have to do better. when anthony hopkins was cast as nixon, it was the same situation. but, anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was nixon. dennehey didn't even try. what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this. besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the four-letter word what "saving private ryan" did for dismemberment, it stunk. too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a "season to turn off half-way through the broadcast." the only good thing about this is that it was television movie. i didn't have to waste my hard-earned money on this piece of trash.

i watched this with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well founded, it seems. what was this movie about? knight? the season? the players? what? it was all over the place all the time. it had no tension (sorry, we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things) but brian denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension. cheaply shot, like a macgiver episode. contrast this thanksgiving main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie "only in america" to show how to do sports biopics, warts and all. notice that espn promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again?

its obvious espn drools whenever knight is in the news, but did they have to make a freakin' movie about him? this was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie i have ever seen. it had it all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc etc. it looked like it was shot on a $10 budget. cummon, whats up with the game scenes? were they in a middle school gym? and the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. and brian denehy as bob knight? give me a break. denehey looked like...denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. espn lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. they poured millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment. bob knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. espn blew it. even knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.

"season on the brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at bob knight and his indiana hoosiers. and dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. so i made a point of watching this adaptation.it disappointed on every level. dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play knight - like he had accepted the role just prior to filming. the rest of the cast isn't much better.and it was obvious that this was espn's first movie. it was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.) skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day!

despite the famous cast this animated version of dickens tale is the borest i've seen. enough that i zapped away in he first commercial break. the characters didn't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheap.i'll give this movie a very low rating. give me the disney version anytime.

why wasn't this voted for best picture of 1998? this has to be the best movie ever. it makes something like citzen kane look like utter crap, come on, citzen kane wasn't even in color! i love this movie, it has to be the best movie i've ever put money down on. i am still shocked that it wasn't nominated for anything! if 10 is the highest you can give it, i give it 20!

i didn't really get this movie because i'm not some perv like you, who is into lesbian stuff.the girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny (her lips are so silicone!), but she's really lame and insecure. she tries to come off like a surfer-guy (better than dressing slutty, but still weird and definitely unfashionable); the movie doesn't explain why she's trying to pass herself off as a man. oh, right, to "get" the poor, dumb girl. i forgot. she makes all these dumb inventions which are not funny, and she's a really lousy actress. plus, that waif look is so out!this dumb blond girl from melrose place plays(surprise) a dumb blond.she thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! they even make out! ewww! i guess that part was sort of funny.

there is a reason chairman of the board got a 2, (which is too high) this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and i seen my share of rotten films. chairman of the board stars two of the most annoying actors/people today, carrot top and courtney thorne smith. carrot top just isn't funny anymore and wasn't in this piece of trash. courtney thorne smith isn't any better, just watch "according to jim" and you will see a prime example of what i am talking about. chairman of the board got a 1 from me, because that is low as you can go it is that bad. i am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't on the imdb bottom 100 somewhere, i would put this in the top 5 on that list, but its slowly working its way there.

before i sat down and watched this film on hbo, i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot. well, that's exactly what i got out of it, except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. i wasn't expecting it to be, i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste. well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it. the whole plot was very stupid, cheap acting, and some of the lines were very very dumb. otherwise than that, it still had it's funny moments, even though not many.all in all, if you're going to rent this, don't. watch it on television. i gave it a 4, i was generous because it made me laugh, but yet it was still pretty stupid.

carrot top in a full length movie, enough said. only reason this doesn't get a one is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10, and this is no extreme ops. horrible god awful. there are some movies that are so bad they are unintentionally funny, then there are movies that make you physically unwell and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide. burn all copies of the movie, shoot anyone who had non creative input on this movie, torture anyone with any creative input and as for the star, there are only so many things that can be said online, but he should be begging for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head by the time the work is done.

this movies shook my will to live why this abomination isn't the bottom 100 list i don't know.my life was saved by the healing power of danny trejo.worst movie ever, i dare you watch. it's like a 90 minute collect calling commercial, only much much worse. i rather watch the blue screen it's that bad really

people don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. the same type of people that see a movie with carrot top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. is carrot top funny? of course not. was this movie anything special? of course not. it was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about mr. top. movies like this, or kazaam, or killer klowns from outer space and pretty much any movie pauly shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. you watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think carrot top is hilarious.please people if you ready know carrot top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

this is what they came up with for prop comedian carrot top's first feature film.a stupid surfer (carrot dude) inherits an r&d enterprise from an old kahuna (jack warden). things go less than swimmingly, but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate raiders. the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart-girl courtney thorne-smith would find this red-headed step-child fascinating in the least (but then, he just inherited millions). 'classic' moments include comic larry miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup.funny comedy? try un-funny toilet humor, and that's exactly where this belongs - in the toilet... flush twice.

is this a bad movie? don't take my word for it. consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie: · while he was watching this movie, the brain of mr. harold faber of sandusky, ohio, forcibly ejected itself from his skull at over 200 kph and preceded to squirm across the floor shrieking noooo nooo noooo.· mrs. louise robbins of enid, oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired homemaker, committed ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this movie.· ms. janine hosmer of columbia, south carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie, although she had not been pregnant.· while watching this movie together, mr. and mrs. lawrence wells of san franciso, california, spontaneously exploded with such force that mr. wells's left tibia was later found embedded in the wall of a house in marin county.there have been many similar incidents.of those who did not suffers more serious effects such as those detailed above, at least 75% became incurably, violently, and understandably insane after viewing this movie. of the remaining 25%, most had already been insane before viewing the movie; the remainder were either blind and/or and deaf or in a persistent vegetative state.i'm not saying don't rent it, if you want to. i'm just reporting what was in the papers.

or at least forceable retirement! this movie is awful, horrible, terrible, rank, rotten, putrid... well, you get the idea. do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish, because it's sure to kill you. (i only survived because i missed the first half hour.) carrot top is a bad comedian, and an even worse actor. i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money. it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two (literally... i can't imagine this made more than $2!).and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith (a halfway decent actress, certainly above this at any rate) had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung. was she that bored during that 3.5 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal? or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet (aka carrot top)?i give this a 2/10, and that's probably way too high. i try to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since i didn't see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained. i don't think i'll be watching it again to find out if it's really worth a 1!

carrot top's "chairman of the board" and his at&t commercials are living proof that fly-blown fecal matter is available in the color orange. not freely available, however, as hbo charges for such garbage. blehhh! the saving grace of cotb is that it surely fills suicide hot-lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (sadly) carrot top probably contributes to his sponsor at&t's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated hbo viewers. i can visualize the hordes of traumatized tv viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of last-minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of cotb's orange-haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.

eh it's not really as good as the other dragonballs. the villains are actually rip-offs of other z villains like cell, frieza, and even majin buu. with baby being frieza's clone, super 17 being cell's clone, and the shadow dragons being buu's clone(s). the story is also very bad as it deals with goku shrinking. shrinking!! it deals with him shrinking to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going. let us not forget how weak the characters become. gohan can't go mystic anymore and is even weaker than pan.(it's sad i know). speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now she's lost all that cuteness and become an irritating,whiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way. goten doesn't even have a purpose in the series and trunks... well i don't know what to say about trunks. gt is just an attempt to milk the popular dragonball franchise. if you really like dragonball then avoid this series. it doesn't even feel like dragonball. i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad (at least to me) and the theme songs both ending and opening are better (japanese, not american). might've been better if toriyama san worked on it.

there are so many logical errors in this show it's barely worth me stating. 1) mystic gohan is non existent 2) uub is as powerful as majin buu yet plays absolutely no role in the show, somehow he is easily overpowered by every bad guy 3) the whole super saiyan 4 idea is retarded and it's appalling that he loses to super 17 (which is the worst idea for a db villain ever) 4) super saiyan 4 goku is no match for super 17 but non transformed goku using a move he learned in a movie that wasn't supposed to happen, kills him with ease 5) vegeta is utterly useless 6) no character other than goku has any impact to the outcome of the battles 7) the series ends with a spirit bomb...come on 8) goku invincible? absorbs dragonballs? lame 9) gotenks?...better yet goten??? trunks??? they both suck 10) super saiyan 4 involves a magical transformation into an adult 11) goku is a kid 12) goku is a kid 13) no super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) no imagination with the animation of gogeta 15) gogeta utterly useless 16) big bang kamehameha is the biggest let down in anime history (not really logical but i'm going off on a tangent) 17) shortest character fights everi could go on longer if i hadn't repressed the majority of memories associated with this show. when i make enough money i am going to fund the remaking of this series.

i bought the dvd of this movie because i am a fan of william devane and i was really disappointed about "a christmas visitor". the story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your tv or dvd player after about the half of it. the dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a tv movie. william devane was alright in his part and he was acting quite good, but he did so much better in other movies and projects. meredith baxter was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm hearted mother to the viewers. instead she was playing very cool and wasn't better than a middle-class actress. i absolutely cannot recommend this movie. spare your time and your money for this one.

this film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences at the death of a child, and the healing that can finally come to them.the family learns of the death of their son on christmas eve, 1991, ruining the christmas season for them. they do not celebrate it again for many years. there is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation.the matthew character makes a reference to jesus, but i suspect that other comments he makes come from non-christian sources. i wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments. if so, it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie.

i felt i had to add a comment after seeing the breathless gushing of the other comment. i was taken to see this film as a child by my unknowing parents, expecting a normal norman wisdom jolly romp comedy. instead, what you get is this insipid british sex comedy of the worst kind where norman (norman!) plays a swinger aiming to get off with as many 'birds' as possible. absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and acted, no semblance of a script beyond the worst kind of double-entendre, and very vague hints of 'naughtiness'. and all seemingly on that special grainy film stock that is reserved for 1960's-1970's british low budget films. about the only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune, which still pops up in my brain after 30-odd years.finally, in the last scene you also get to see norman naked - running across the sand and looking frozen. i think so anyway- at that point my mother hauled me out of the cinema. i saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still dire.if you're any fan or take any interest in the little man and his career, you'll apply the '10-foot-bargepole' rule to this. believe me, you do not need to see norman wisdom's backside.

it's a shame that someone so idolised by many kids as well as parents should demean himself in appearing in this exploitative, bandwagon-jumping tripe. i often wonder if mr wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride. at least sally geeson had the decency to retire to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish. a cameo by some long forgotten pop called the pretty things cannot rescue the film from it's awfulness. if you want 60's nostalgia invest in 'here we go round the mulberry bush' instead, starring barry evans and sally's sister judy instead.

as i write this, norman wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours cackling and yelping old catch-phrases at his increasingly suicidal nurse.indeed, by the time you read this he will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a near 80 year career of hysterical mirth-making from the lovable funster with the crooked chequered cap. what most of these obituaries won't recall is how norman wisdom had already committed a form of suicide back in the late 1960s with this staggeringly poor, yet strangely compelling endpaper to his movie career.the signs are ominous from the off  "tony tenser presents" go the titles. you scratch your head  "where have i seen that name before..?" well, on the titles of a lot of the cheapest, crappiest british films of the 1970s so just take your pick.then it says  "a menahem golan production". oh dear.from what i could make out what follows is a combination of confessions from a holiday camp and last tango in paris. sponsored by the southport tourist board.norman wisdom is very versatile at being norman wisdom (or a variation of such) here. even in trash like this, he's never off form and somehow keeps you watching through parted fingers as he paws and dribbles all over a (clearly insane) sally geeson. tony tenser and menahem golan were, between them, responsible for some true cinematic horrors but the bedroom scene in filmic atrocity reborn. sally plays the role of a lobotomised sex toy very well, by the way.i wonder if any of the crazy young cats who populate this movie's party scenes maybe thought to themselves in a quiet moment "ummold norman+sex+hippies. get me outta this mess!!" i guess it was a payday for them.a do feel sorry for the pretty things though. they probably thought "yeah! this'll do for us what blow up did for the yardbirds" and so old norman's leading man career ended. freezing his little balls off in southport.i went there once. it was a depressing place.

norman wisdom's final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings  bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date, this being a product of the swinging sixties! the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager sally geeson (who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either); sarah atkinson appears as geeson's friend who warns norman of her fickle character.the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard maltin's bomb rating would have it and, if anything, is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis (being in many ways similar to hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979]  both of which, incidentally, i've only just watched); towards the end, norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking! the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track!

well acted, yes. very well, i must say, even though i don't speak chezck. nice cinematography. but the script is lame, really lame. a predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen. ok, maybe the ending isn't as predictable, but is it any good? it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already, and forget about the day after.i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough. that's really sad, because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie, which actually says a a lot about it, don't you think? the thing is.. .it has no soul and no originality. compare this movie with barrio, or riff raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot the child). it's sad to see that this is a much worse film.

czech cinematography is traveling through dark times... this movie is a tangible evidence. slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictive people, characteristic of their stupidity. a young and healthy boy who doesn't want to work and prefer to live in a decaying shack with a feckless alcoholic aunt. because of the idiocy of tonik, who's just able to announce "dad, i'll not work in the factory" (i'd really like to know why); i understand the condition of his "house", but i'm really not able to digest the horrible mess around. cramped sentimentality everywhere. why didn't monika escort her boy to work abroad? young czech couples do it very often. and take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn... that's too much.irresponsible mother (badly acted by geislerová), naive & stupid boy (tonik), silly and confused girl (monika)... yes, somebody has already told it - badly directed and acted soap opera. actors like martin huba, bolek polivka, tatiana wilhelmova and simona stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece.

okay, so maybe the acting wasn't bad, but i am typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come. the chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer (guy), and few people other than uninvolved bystanders and the accusee seem to dispute her. so what is the point of staying with this drama? beats the heck out of me. i kept thinking (or hoping) there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation, but none was forthcoming. in summary, i cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless tv movie, based on a true story or not.

jeff powers (lou diamond phillips, "young guns 1&2"), a cop with a history of roughing up criminals, is recruited into an elite clandestine lapd division. this doesn't sit well with jeff's newspaper reporter girlfriend, kelly (chelsea field) who's looking for a story on the squad. soon enough jeff's conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn (scott glenn, "the hunt for red october" & "backdraft"), the leader of the unit.this is a fairly routine, dare i say mundane, cop-action/drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that's content to go strictly from point a to point b. the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that's no real reason to watch the film. kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l. lester directed films right before this one (from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo) were all highly entertaining vehicles. eye candy: chelsea field gets briefly toplessmy grade: d+

unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of magnum force. in that one lieutenant hal holbrook put together his own little squad from academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders. in extreme justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the lapd. just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question. this special investigations squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the lapd, those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service. which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips, a detective with more than his share of beefs with internal affairs for excessive use of force, is perfect for the squad.what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact he's got a nice live-in relationship with a reporter, chelsea field. that one certainly threw me in this film, you'd think that lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team.and what his team is, is a death squad. they target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act. then it's open season.extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point. there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside. no civilians got hurt when the citizens of coffeyville did that to the daltons. or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in. that's what were asked to believe here.and frankly i couldn't buy it. a lot of good players get really wasted in this one.

after consuming "human pork chop" and properly digesting it, i felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers, that chewing on this product is no fun and its substance of low nutritive value.according to the dull nature of this film, the following is gonna be a warning more than a review. this is the first time i wished, that there is an "i-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie"-button on imdb, because the only reaction to this boring piece of trash is stasis and indifference. every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here, a "10" is out of question anyway, "1" might persuade some readers, that this is one of those cases where "it's so bad that it's actually really bad and that's kewl!", and "5" is unsatisfying as well, people might think, that it's an ok-flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun, which it is not... honest to god, it's neither a "10", a zero nor a 5, it's nothing, a black hole, a futile work conceived by an embryo. i bought the region 3 dvd, which was cheap (7 bucks!!!) at least and of good picture-quality, i bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry. oh boy, was i to be disappointed. this movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor... it's not even laughable, it doesn't take itself too serious to be laughed at, but still serious enough so as not to be comic. a truly unpassionate, amateurish effort. the only sequence that i found mildly disturbing is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall... but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution. the further down cited toilet scene is unrealistic and filmmed without any sense for suspense, suffering or humiliation - the feces look like painted marsh-mellows!!! there is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong 85-minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the dvd) start to dispose of the female body. reminded me of "american psycho" and "shallow grave", now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces.let's be realistic for once and not rush to make a myth out of every asian-wannabe-scary-movie, as seems to happen lately...if you are looking out for some eastern horror then try danny lee's masterpiece of the very same (english) title "ba xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (human pork chop) it's from 1992 and has - not without reason i might add - been compared to "henry: portrait of a serial killer". there is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called "ren tou dou fu shang" ("there is a secret in my soup") of the same year, sort of a rival production. it's available as a region 3 dvd and by most regarded as superior to "peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". i might add a few more words on the special effects... what special effects?!?... there are a few chopped off limbs, they look awful - in a wrong sense - probably "made in hong kong".that's about all the info i can share on this subject, hopefully it will prove helpful... enjoy your meal!

ordinarily, i wouldn't waste the time on reviewing a film like "human pork chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the earlier film of the same title, which is probably better known in the west as "the untold story"), but since the reviews already here are quite vague as to what it actually consists of, i figured i'd best post something more detailed, so as no one actually gets tempted (as i was) into buying it because of the film's mystique. i honestly would just say stay away.**** major spoilers are contained below ****"human pork chop", i was expecting to be like a chinese interpretation of the popular japanese "guinea pig" films. anyone who's watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from. there's a strong sense of humour running throughout it - you can't watch the ludicrous "he never dies" without laughing and "the making of guinea pig" is a fabulous turning of the whole thing on its head, proving it was just made, with some glee, by fairly good natured gorehounds. all the gp films have a punk rock, diy, shot-on-video aesthetic, occasional flashes of genuine artistry ("mermaid in a manhole"), an angry political agenda and a warped, deranged zeal that sets them in a league of their own."human pork chop" has none of the above.it's shot on 35mm film (with disarmingly good production values), it's 90 gruelling minutes long and it's utterly devoid of anything redeeming. the plot tells, in flashback at a police interviewing of the suspects, of the systematic torture, death and eventual dismemberment of grace, a heroin-addicted streetwalker who is kidnapped and brutalised by her pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from him.despite its fleeting attempts at being a morality play, the film possesses a detached, inhumane feel to it and one can't help but dwell on the mindsets of those behind it. although it half-heartedly paints grace as an innocent victim, the mean-spirited nature of its screenplay and the protagonist's constant, vicious dialogue veers towards a shocking, utterly unwelcome "she deserves it!" point of view which makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch. far more time is spent detailing grace's degradation and when her captors are eventually deemed guilty and jailed, it seems like a hurried afterthought on behalf of the writers who've long since stopped caring less.what makes it boggling as to why anyone would want to watch such a film is that even the kind of people who do really get off on mindless sex and violence in the movies would be severely missing out. the torture is just a continuous stream of kickings, slappings, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and then increasingly bizarre displays of power on behalf of the captors use grace's heroin addiction to make her do their bidding. and when i say that, don't get me wrong, incidentally. unlike "guinea pig" with it's frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost teenage feel of mock-titillation to the proceedings in spite of the ultraviolence, "human pork chop" has no such sexual overtones. there isn't any actual nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of malice by the odious protagonists (who early in the film are seen stuffing a dog into a bag and banging it against a brick wall - don't worry, not real, just a cheap special effect!).the only actual bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they dismember grace's body and boil the bones, all very poor special fx (nowhere near "guinea pig" level) and, by that stage, you'll probably be already feeling too miserable and sick to even care what's going on.the film is depressingly bleak and uncompromising along a similar line to buddy giovinazzo's "combat shock" and i guess could even be compared, at a push. both movies deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of any social or morally redeemable characters and both movies 'climax' in a particularly visceral manner with the individual's inevitable, inescapable doom.in fairness, neither 'glamourises' it's violence (whereas "guinea pig" could easily be accused of this) but one can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this. it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such brutality and with a leaden-pace, a virtually non-existent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, i just can't understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like this. i only made it to the end, purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly... which i hope i've now done.overall score: 0 of of 10. welcome to the bottom of the barrel.

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning as a boy, mark goddard (c thomas howell) sat powerless as his family, including his hero cop father (jeff fahey), were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he'd tried to bring down. with an inner desire to punish wrong-doers festering in him as he grew up as a result of this, mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects he's chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this. but then he learns of 'justice incorporated', a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man (ed lauter) who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the law.but, then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought.the sweeper gets into problems from the off-set, because we've seen this exact same plot done before (and better) in films like the star chamber with michael douglas and magnum force with clint eastwood. the title doesn't make any sense either. but we also have to contend with the movie's utter ludicrousness, including a scene where a daughter's headphone manages to drown out the sound of her family being slaughtered, a finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on a wright brothers plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous acting ever put on screen and a very clichéd, pretentious script. but there's some cool action sequences here and there and the movie's unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse. **

i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for björks "bachelorette" with clips from it. so i watched the movie. and it is indeed stuningly beautiful. a masterpiece of animation.unfortunately, the story doesn't keep up. it starts out well, with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride, but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls, people float away, and finally for no reason whatsoever, utena is tranformed into a car, and a highspeed chase ensues.i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. if you are gonna watch this movie, turn of the sound, it's better that way.

this was a first feature for clinton, i was there, while he shot this mess back in adelaide around 98...although i wasn't involved directly in the production, i was witness to the typically delusional behavior, post set, that went down,: the parties, the drugs, the illusionary glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a byproduct of young, talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame & worldly position.i like clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another crack with a more mature script...there the problems lay, and i'm sure a much better job will be done, if there's a next time round.! because, frankly, he certainly didn't do himself any favours with this on his cv and neither did the cast...but hey, it was a paying job, in country where actors regularly starve to deathin summary, fascinating to watch 'the making of' basically, not so much fun to experience (alas!).

missed it at the cinema, but was always slightly compelled. found it in the throw-out bin at my local video shop for a measly two bucks! will i now give it away to anyone who wants it? probably! no purposeful plot, one dimensional characters, plastic world ripped off from many far better films, no decent dialogue to speak of. you know that empty feeling when you come down off ecstasy? its that feeling right here. sad thing is, the australia i know is heading in this direction, minus the melodrama and simple answers. interesting only to see the older aussie actors (who had to act back in their day to get by) vs the newer aussie actors (who have to look good to get by). like some horribly garish narrative introduction to a film clip that never actually starts... poor kylie, started her career as an actress as well...

first: the recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. this is just a cheap market-scheme. she's barely in it and does neither of the things. the marketing here is unbelievable, and i'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't objected. the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppy-handed by a teenage quentin tarantino. and thats not meant as a compliment, mind you. i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. it seems to be about nothing. just about cool teenagers tripping around living 'on the edge'. the characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie doesn't use its potential. as said, there's no story of any substance here. it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad. it definitely has that feeling. still though, i guess some people might enjoy it, but i'd say there's far better movies like this around.

what a nasty cynical film. apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market. made by some industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could cobble together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, sample people deservedly failed miserably at the australian box office. it is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting sample people might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of 'what teens want to see in a movie'. the character played by ben mendelsohn is particularly offensive and kylie minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers. it is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung-together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. well the were very wrong. a mini budget film made in 1983 called going down got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison.

there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great. sadly, like bring it on 2, bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on. there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film. the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. the performance of hayden panattiere was sub-par both in terms of acting and cheerleading. there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc) were just so stupid. my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the "acting" of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film. only great character: kirresha.

seriously, i couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. for some reason, the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting, groveling and yelling like cro-magnon bipeds. i understand that this was about gymnastics, but seriously, what's with all the roaring and human bleating ? i also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis.although this movie has actual human acrobatics, i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns. this is truly a milestone in the history of film-making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely urrrrr ! or rfff ! sound.incredible.

without a doubt, one of the most racially prejudiced films i've ever seen, with the prejudice being levelled against hayden panettiere as she has to move into a tough inner city school. she is constantly called "white girl" and other slurs based on her colour. firstly would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse? and secondly the stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace. the writers apparent desire to show they were "hip" also extended to missing the point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition, not through talent but by intimidating their white opponents!! these overtones to the film took it away from it's expected direction of a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience into a vehicle that does none of the participants any credit. hayden panettiere has star quality but i would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever get much further. all in all a charmless film that was a waste of time.

this was terrible, mean-spirited, and full of the worst clichés and racial stereotypes i've seen in a looong time. seeing hayden p trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hi, one pant leg up on yer sweats and some braids downs't make you "down with the homies"). solange knowles pretty much grimaces through the entire movie. most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes...what was up with the finale??? and poor rihanna was just plain exploited to get people to watch her "act", which she can't.put simply, this film downs't even deserve one star. please put this tired franchise to rest. or at least make the next one bring it on iv: cheerleaders vs. freddy & jason.

the first two bring it on movies were both quite good in their own ways. the first was fairly serious, the second was successfully satirical - and the third opted for the usual idiotic low-brow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that hollywood has coming out of the woodwork. the entire point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation, and that's the extent of this movie's comedy. ha ha. not.there is no shred of cleverness in this movie, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anybody with half a brain to be entertained by (and sure enough, i could not sit through all of it). if you're the sort of person who're entertained by fart jokes, this movie is for you. congratulations.2 out of 10.

stars: hayden pantierre.there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot, and this one is just a poor rehashing of it. populer white girl moves to ethnic school, doesn't fit in, soon becomes accepted. originality is nonexistent in this, and neither are the laughs. it uses so many old poorly executed jokes it's annoying. i don't know why they think it's a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films, but it isn't. with that said, the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses.my rating: * out of ****. pg-13 for language and sexual humor.

the strawberry blond has a great script, but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney, he's not the person for the part. i do think olivia did a great job. this movie is also a day dream wrap around, so it's hard to follow. i don't like the male character attitude; the way cagney presented it was just off. i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character. ( if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie). the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a positve attitude, and change the script so he is happy he's with oliva.this movie points out money does not bring happiness, women right jokes. plain and simple not the best movie, but every one must decide for themselves.

the rap, the book this movie was 'based' on was one of the most difficult books i've ever read. yet i could not put it down. raunchy, crude, foul, lewd...you name it, it had it. it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel i've ever read.well, as for the flick...it was deplorable. i mean, tim mcintire as wasco? wasco was the baddest mutha...talking 'bout wasco...mcintire as wasco is like casting tim conway as charles manson.what happened to the main character in the book? little arv. he doesn't even exist in the movie...fast walking was not the main dude in the book. why even name credit this thing with the rap? none of the spirit, atmosphere, nastiness, or drama of the book was captured in this movie.for me it was not only a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.

i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger. seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties. there is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed. the narrator says something like " perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, ma barker became a real mother". this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.

apparently re-cut episodes from the gangbusters tv show on the big screen. while this was frequently done in the 50's and 60's because people didn't have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an increased return on their investment (big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen resale of a series that isn't in syndication), the results were usually less then the sum of their parts. the only time i've ever seen it work were where multi-part stories were put together (ala rocky jones or man from uncle) or in the case of horror anthology (the veil and 13 demon street). here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the 20's and 30's (dillinger, pretty boy floyd, bonnie and clyde, etc)inter-cut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down. its a weird concoction that doesn't quite work because its clear that there are things here that don't belong together. more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didn't seem right. in fairness i won't describe the cheapness of the production since this was what early tv (and the series) was like. its not bad, but its not very good either. to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that i've seen work better a single episodes where we're not expecting as much. given the choice i'd rent dvds of the show instead of this movie.

i caught a screening of this at the true/false documentary film festival in columbia, missouri, and i was pretty disappointed. i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the rnc, but what i got was a largely flawed, bad-acted, fictitious, conspiracy ridden badly woven tale. i'd heard of its neo-documentary technique, "blending both true and false" but i expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews, but it was more along the lines of a terrible made-for-conspiracy theory tv movie.the acting overall is terrible except for rossario, which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training, his excuse being that he wanted them to be real. heres a hint, real people can't act, but actors can usually act real.it would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie, its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role, it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big 'good' or 'evil' on every character.skip it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary/

i know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. but the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open america's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government, and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. but somehow the documentary aspect of it, takes away from its drama. the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's.it would have been better to stick to a drama format. perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy.

this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen. i always liked chuck norris in films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker. i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. i know an african american who looks like this trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, i think this show started great but lost steam as time went onthey should have dumped chucks side kick

i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think "dog the bounty hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of "high octane" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?

this series is formulaic and boring. the episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, walker goes after him, and it ends in a karate match. the villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. after about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. certainly not norris's best work. his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks. if you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clichéd snooze-fests, then this is for you.

walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. the script for james 'jimmy' trivette, walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng, and is played with about as much conviction.on this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). that's not how life works, that's not how people are. this show doesn't take place in this reality.the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. with walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. it's for the elderly. it's for wishful thinkers. it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. it's for people whose drug of choice is their television.i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show. my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.i used to like chuck norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.

this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today. horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. i will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference. with all the negative points this series has, i still prefer it over reality tv, it can't really get any more worthless than that.

this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.

i gotta admit it, i love horror films...especially 80s slasher films. hell, i even love cheese like sleepaway camp and night of the demons. but, i didn't think much of this movie. the death scenes weren't very well done, the cgi was terrible, and the acting was ho-hum. worst of all was the story which didn't make sense at all. i'd say save your money but chances are, if you want to see this movie...you're going to anyway. i didn't hate it...it's just not very good. overall, it's just another bland, lifeless horror film that lacks life (it's no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed).

it's hard to comment on this movie. it's one of the few movies dimension actually has not shelved (it's hard to come up with a reason why) and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters it's opening day. maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece.ray sawyer is just a tow truck driver, until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in return, he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns. at the morgue, ray comes back to life, and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur. what brings this movie down is it's paper thin characters. i didn't care for one moment about any of them. also, the dialog was less than ho-hum. also, it was very predictable. characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things, like check creaky noises, call out people's names, and trip on a rock while being chased. i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be. and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shown?what's good? well, there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks on.but other than that, it's another august/september disappointment. i was looking forward to it, but i did not get what was expected.

i've watched this movie (movie?) casually and i've never stop watching because is so ridiculous any dog can play this act and will be better then the actors (actors?)of this bad remake of the fatal attraction there is no directing, no playing, only an unlucky copy of the adrian lyne movie if you have doubt to suicide watch this and you can choose...for "yes"i can't imagine people that went to cinema to see this rubbish; maybe someone that had an empty afternoon and choose the first cinema near house to stay 2 hours with some others to forget problems but it's hard to go back home relaxed

this episode has just aired in the uk.what a disappointment. the heavy-handed touches of humour were ill-judged, childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good storyline. i cannot believe that jerry bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place. i have seen every previous episode of this show, and even the episode where jack played his own older self was way ahead of this episode. the lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism.there was also no continuity from the previous episode. there was nothing in the storyline investigating martin's dangerous behaviour or possible drug addiction. there was similarly nothing explicitly written about jack's burgeoning relationship with ann. usually without a trace is pretty good at this sort of continuity.the next episode needs to be a considerable improvement.

this movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes. i don't know what everyone else was smoking calling this a beatiful film. i feel that a couple hours of my life were stolen from me and i want them back. i would put this in the category of a battlefield earth. yes folks it is that bad. you would do just as well to watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over it would have the same effect. do not waste your time!!!

i guess when people say this is beautifully filmed they are talking about the close ups of frogs and the cooking of meals. it certainly doesn't refer to the set which seems to be composed of about 3 rooms with no outside shots at all. also all of it is filmed too close up.i got sick of the little boy who keeps farting at miu or pouring hot wax over ants...also do vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their haunches? kind of gross looking at least the way this movie depicts it--one close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more.then finally comes part two... a chick flick for vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano (he is cultured). the pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit. deep.except for a few nice close ups this film is a dud. it is sort of a soap opera with out dialog. it is cloyed. how is it beautiful?? the set looks completely fake.no don't make the mistake i did and rent it because someone recommended it. i was expecting beautiful shots of the coastal mountains of vietnam or something when i heard it was a visual gem.i wanted to like this movie. i like foreign movies even prefer them. but this movie is dumb and dull. it will leave you irritated that something like this won a bunch of prizes.

i checked out this video expecting to like it. wanting to like it. i like foreign films, i like beautiful cinematography, i know the critics liked this film (including my favorite, roger ebert), and i don't mind "slow" films.well, it's beautiful. that's about the best i can say for it. the plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the glances are very meaningful, the actors are very sincere, and it seems like a very long movie. i fell asleep half way though it, woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. it was a trial, but i made it to the end. i didn't like it any better for that.

the video case for this film reads "a story of beauty, passion, and forbidden fruit". are they talking about the same movie i just saw?! they can't be, as the film i just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion and as for the fruit, this is all hogwash meant to entice the potential viewer to see this movie. if only it did have some passion or some life to it, i would have greatly enjoyed this film. instead, it was an agonizingly slow paced and not particularly interesting film that i would definitely not want to see again. it isn't that it's a bad film (after all it is very beautifully filmed), but it is dull beyond belief. i kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie just ended. there was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything--just a rather unexciting story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid.

skeletons in the closet takes the father-teenage son genre to new levels of low. this is a movie that serves no purpose. the plot is layed out in the first few minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are cliché and despite plot twists that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything plays out exactly as you think it will. halfway through the movie i could no longer stand the snail pace and started fast forwarding. the movie ended exactly as i expected. linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction. if you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe whodunit, watch it on fast forward.

(some spoilers) prc quickie that has j. carrol naish playing dr. igor markoff who's not really dr. karkoff but an impostor who took over his identity back in europe. the real dr. karkoff had a affair with dr.markoff's wife that lead to him to murder the real dr.markoff and then having his wife lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like the "elephant man's" sister. this was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep lenore all to himself; but the disturbed lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself. this nut, the fake dr. markoff, then spots patricia lawrence, wanda mckay, one evening at the theater where her father tony lawernce, ralph morgan, a world famous pianist is giving a concert. enchanted by the lovely patricia who's a dead ringer for his dead wife lenore dr. markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she's want's nothing to do with him.after getting ridicules in his efforts to get patricia to fall in love with him, by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day,tony goes to see the crazed dr. mankoff to tell him to stop annoying his daughter. it's then that tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow. with his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano tony is told by his doctor dr. adams,sam flint, that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then dr. markoff! the person who gave it to him. the movie has the usual sub-plots with dr. markoff's assistant maxine,tala birell, who's also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for patricia. there's also dr. markoff's hulking butler glenn strange who, like his pet gorilla, is just a big clumsy oaf who can't even subdue maxine who's less the half the size. strange ends up getting bopped on the head and knocked out cold by patricia's boyfriend bobby blake, terry frost. as for the gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in maxine and is chased away, and locks himself back up in his cage, by the pet dog ace. dr. markoff in his desperation to get patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting markoff dead with his own gun. there is a happy ending to this whole mess with maxine, who knew as much about markoff's cure for acromegaly as he did, injecting tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new. the movie ends, like it started, with tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater.

dr. markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting , trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. when he attends a piano concert, he is stricken by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and sets out to woo her. but when she wants nothing to do with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure.that is the basic premise for this b-grade low budget thriller. i have to say i was underwhelmed by this movie. not that it was terrible-it wasn't, but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it either. it was entertaining enough for a viewing but is not one that will stay in my memory.the dialog is a bit corny at times and the acting is just mediocre. the story is fairly predictable and doesn't really give us anything new. of course, i can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a svengali-like stare that fails to mesmerize his victims.it may be worth a watch if you like this sort of movie, but don't go into it with too many expectations.

"a scientist has developed a serum which grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads. the scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. j. carrol naish (as dr. igor markoff) plays "the monster maker" in the low budget bela lugosi mode.mr. naish's serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly", which american heritage defines as, "a chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, face, and jaw that is caused by overactivity of the pituitary gland." ralph morgan (as anthony lawrence) plays the afflicted man with some dignity. pretty blonde wanda mckay (as patricia "pat" lawrence) is the daughter desired by mad scientist naish; in early scenes, ms. mckay and naish emote hilariously.watch for tala birell (as maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; she plays the somewhat garbo-like, and long suffering, assistant to naish. ms. birell definitely steals the film; and, you've got to question dr. markoff's sanity in casting her aside. glenn strange (as steve) and a crazed gorilla (ray corrigan) add to the fun. the monster makeup (maurice seiderman) is very good.**** the monster maker (1944) sam newfield ~ j. carrol naish, ralph morgan, tala birell

start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a look-alike. throw in your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (isn't this the stuff that leo g. carroll contracted from the spider venom in "tarantula"). throw in the fact that the main character, instead of finding some way to attract the young woman, engages in heavy-handed stalking, until he totally draws attention to himself and has to hatch this insane plot: if he can make the girl's father sick, then help him recover, she will marry him. the problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable. anyone with half a brain would have seen through things. there's a third party, a woman that the doctor, played by j. carroll naish, has treated with great insensitivity. you know she is going to be a factor. there's also a gorilla kept in a cage who is used occasionally for heaven know's what. oh well. there is so little sense to this who thing that it plays itself out and people get their just desserts.

just plain terrible. nick and michael are way better actors than this. a "c" rated flick at best. the plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped. even the film and sound quality was terrible. i suppose that these were all young actors at the time and this script just filled a job nitch.

occasionally on talk shows a good topical debate sparks some interesting opinions from the audience, unfortunately there is always some desperately sad person seeking acceptance who will end any interesting debate instantly by getting up and saying the proverbial "everyone should get along and love each other" as they know they are guaranteed to get applause and affirmation, as no one would dare disagree.well they are the same people who marked this film as good, why did they do that? insecurity. anyway that's all i'll say on that matter.the film, it starts of reasonably interestingly so you hope it will build, and if like me you've settled in with a nice couple of glasses of wine and some cheese then you will give it even more of a chance simply because you can't be bothered to move.but then you daydream, you wander, your mind drifts of onto other things, why? because the director did too! he took his foot off the gas, and then he realized 'ooops' so to compensate he accelerates hard, but then he drifts again, and again so do you, the story slows, the plot thins and almost disappears, you even wonder to yourself 'so what happened again?' as you ponder your screen will show nick nolte running around with some supposed purpose, but you will have long since cared as to what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background to your day dreaming.michael moriarty who plays john converse has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or indeed his face, somewhat like a ventriloquist, he must have gone to the nicolas cage school of expressionless facial acting, or he was attacked by the phantom botox injector.tuesday weld was to play marge converse, but instead she played mia farrow to perfection.in all there are hundreds of thousands of films to see, so leave this one to one of the last, you see i've just wasted an evening watching it when i could have watched or done something else, learn by my mistake, nights off relaxing are precious so don't waste one watching this boring tale, do anything else, dust off that old game of cluedo, practice gurning for the evening or have an argument with a loved one, trim your nose hair, get rid of unused files on our laptop, it will be time better spent what ever you should choose.

seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe, it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent-free ladies denise richards and milla jovovich went. it also is a particular grating kind of movie, the kind that think they are smart, funny and original while being poor in every aspect. full blame can go to brian burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. his script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. the situations develop completely without any inner logic, besides that of a desperate scriptwriter. characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, behave stupid and without any real motivation. nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of mrs. richards. we don't believe her relationship with david krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one-hour mark is particularly pitiful. why would anyone fall for a egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b**ch like this in the first place, much less a second time? especially after having supposedly found his..erm...true love? and if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie, than the central couple is. the coupling of krumholtz and jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the richards-one, but it is to no avail. there is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple. worse, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in, whatsoever.overall, a very poor showing. even die-hard rom-com fans might want to pass on this one, as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm.

writer/director brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies, and he seems to think that he's discovered the formula for success: plenty of location shots in new york (preferably in the winter), allusions to old hollywood films (especially musicals), enjoyable musical soundtrack. alas, all of this is mere compensation for burns' lack of talent as a writer. (the great mystery of many writer-directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios, but how they get any backing at all for their films.)normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters, but the couple in this film simply has no appeal. this is not the fault of either david krumholtz or milla jovavich; their characters are just poorly written. what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters' personalities. lacking the ability to create individuals, burns gives us an after-school special inspired by men are from mars, women are from venus.how anyone can see burns as the successor to woody allen is beyond me. i did not laugh once during this film, and the screen-play is full of echo chamber dialog ("i want to paint the town red." "you want to paint the town red?"), which is the most tell-tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living. in one of the early scenes, we see krumholz's actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom. it's the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right; maybe that indicates what burns talents are really suited for.

owen (david krumholtz) and chloe (denise richards) are a youngish couple living in manhattan. owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress. happily for her, chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to hollywood. missing her, owen books a flight to lala land, as a surprise. when he arrives at her set trailer, however, the "house" is shaking, as chloe and her hunky co-star are having a little romantic tryst. the writer and the actress are through. hurt and mad as a hatter, owen goes back to nyc. sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with nadine (milla jovovich) to get him out of his sulky funk. but, it goes badly, as the duo mix like oil and water, mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen's huge shoulder chip. yet, over the next few months, astonishingly, nadine and owen become pals, who confide in each other and hang out. can it turn into something more? well, who the heck cares! this film is so stupid that most folks will yank it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes. the script is pathetic, dismal, and, oh, stupid, too. then again, krumholtz gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well. jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout? william baldwin, too, reaches a career low with his crude and sex-crazy role as owen's brother. the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one. okay, the costumes and production values are adequate. then, too, there is one clever element in that, occasionally, the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking. that doesn't save the film from "bomb" status. don't be stupid, dear film and romcom lovers. do not rent, buy, or borrow this gigantic turkey. i am the stupidest person on earth, today, for watching this thing until the bitter end.

milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her. i have learned to hate that crumpled little three-year-old face she makes whenever she pretends to cry. it makes any points she is trying to make as a serious actress drop off quickly. of course, in a movie with a baldwin and denise, she still shines as a mature actor person. david seemed to be doing woody allen by way of howdy doody. not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted. "how harry met sally" and "two weddings and funeral", even "sleepless in seattle" had scripts, locations and actors. the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking. the locations seemed to be within a few blocks of each other. there are only two actors in this dishrag of an indie flick, milla and the lady who played the chick who was into the stars. i watched most of this through the first time with the sound off, just watching milla. that subscript gag was old the first time i saw it and it's a silly rip off of a song in "how to succeed in business without really trying".

i was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. however, when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i've ever spent at the cinema.in principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why i'm rating this a 4.in this version, sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as "not just wicked, but vulgar." there's also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me; sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset. while the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn't leave you thinking, "oh puh-leeze."about the only things true to the book were:1. sara's father being a soldier 2. the lines between sara and her father ("are you learning me by heart?"/"no. i know you by heart. you are inside my heart.") 3. sara's friendship with becky, and her 'adopting' lottie (although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been) 4. the changing of her room by adding various luxury items. that part was brilliantly done. 5. the basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that's about all that is.people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. possibly. all i can say to that is i have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book.if all you want is a 'feel-good' family film, then this delivers. if you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess (in fact, if you've read the book) don't waste time with this one. it's such a shame; with a cast like this, if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.am i harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? very probably. but if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. preferably more than once.

i really wanted to love this film. i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. the book is marvelous. this film is very far from the book. the book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.in the book, sara is honorable, kind, strong, and never does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. that's the point of the book! she behaves as a "princes" regardless of circumstances. an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. it is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.in the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. sara does what is right simply because it is right.outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. she has half a dozen hot buns. she is very hungry. she gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. when she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think - i don't remember how many.the baker is watching through the window. she is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. other people are similarly influenced by sara.and in the book, her father has died. the man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find sara; he takes her and becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. and sara has her full inheritance, of course.miss minchin is not a chimney sweep. in fact, she remains in her same post at the school. but she is humiliated as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. and sara does speak to miss minchin in the end - miss minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of sara and sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs miss minchin that she had been cruel.there is no comeuppance for miss minchin. she continues on in her miserable existence. it does not matter - what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. it is about self control and humility. it is a wonderful book. this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. my wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. we were not rewarded.i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in. i don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it.don't waste your time - buy the book. it is unforgettable... even for a dad!

i absolutely despise this film. i wanted to love it - i really wanted to. but man, oh man - they were so off with sara. and the father living was pretty cheesy. that's straight out of the shirley temple film.i highly recommend the book. it is amazing. in the book, sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing... because it is right. she doesn't have a spiteful bone in her body.in the film, she is mean-spirited and spiteful. she does little things to get back at miss minchin. in the book, sara is above such things. she does stand up to miss minchin. she tells the truth and is not cowed by her. but she does not do the stupid, spiteful things that the sara in the film does.it's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie. i can't help but wonder... did we read the same book? the whole point of the book was personal responsibility, behaving with honor and integrity, always telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity.sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her. in the book, she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and becky. and miss minchin is not a chimney sweep - that part of the film really was stupid.to see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me. we are praising a film that glorifies petty, spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness? sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. i don't even recognize her in the film... she's not in it.good thing mrs. burnett isn't alive to see this horrid thing. it's ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book.

i have loved the book "a little princess" for most of my life, and was very excited that there was a movie. but i was appalled at this adaptation. not only is the acting wooden, and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book, but the theme is all wrong. the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one, as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child, even when she herself is very hungry. the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses, which cheapens sara's actions considerably, and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story.there are many other things wrong with this movie- too many to list, but here are just a few of the larger ones: this story should be set in britian in the mid 1800s, not america during the first world war. miss minchen is harsh to sara from the start, making her actions when sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning, as she is supposed to be. nowhere is it mentioned that becky is black. sara's father does *not* come back, he is dead. it is his closest friend, and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds sara, and restores her to her proper place. in fact, the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, though they are the source of sara's wealth.all through everything that sara has faced, she always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who hurt her. she would never have called lavinia a "snotty two faced bully". such a thing is completely out of character for her, and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what.this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "ella enchanted", and "anne of green gables the continuing story")the plot of the book is wonderful, and skillfully written, so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting. i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version, which is far superior. or better still, read the book. it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie.

this film is supposed to be about the frustrations of film making. it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom. the setting is an attractive spanish seacoast resort with his usual large cast. the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script. just all ad-lib.a far superior film about the frustrations of film making is francois truffaut's "day for night" made in 1973. it shows all the delays and how the cast can misbehave in an intriguing manner. it doesn't bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film.

this is a piece of hollywood product that should have never left a film can. dialogue without a plausible thought, plot without a point, staging without skill, directing without direction, and acting without the worth of some backwater high school's freshman class play. the entire cast should have been arrested for over acting.but otherwise, okay!

i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired. years earlier, it would have been moving images accompanied by music. later, it would have been sound added to silents. eventually it would have been technicolor, cinemascope or imax. this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture. during all the emotional scenes, the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera. this interruption is painful at it's very least. imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on. painful. i have no idea who came up with this gimmick, but it was the only time i ever saw it used - and for good reason. in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wring their hands, or overact to such a degree, i actually wondered if this was really a comedy. the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations. norma shearer, disappointed in love, searches for a reason to live. she has a friend, played by ralph morgan, who worships her - but she takes him for granted. she is attracted to a doctor, played by clark gable, but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her. she settles for a weakling that needs her desperately. she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him. along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven, only to find out later that he loves her after all. the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success, but she realizes that it's really clark she loves after all. confused yet? forget the rest, just watch a couple of episodes of "as the world turns" and it'll all become clear.if your are ever forced to watch this movie, hold out for the final scene. the gyrations of the actors put harold lloyd to shame. it is not to be missed.

a four-and-a-half-hour o'neill play gets boiled down to a little under two, and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice-over. it can work onstage, but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation, which soft-peddles its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. norma shearer and alexander kirkland, overacting ludicrously, are outclassed by a naturalistic clark gable--he's the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. it gets even funnier when shearer's and gable's son, a surly moppet, does the frozen-face shtick. there are also frank morgan's brother ralph as an unsuccessful suitor, given to soliloquizing "poor charlie!" over and over again, and a young robert young and maureen o'sullivan. by the time they show up, the voice-overs have largely been abandoned, and it plays as a ripe soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays "silver threads among the gold" as background music. robert leonard's direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors. it's certainly entertaining--there's nothing else like it, unless you count groucho's satirical parody in "animal crackers," or an old mad magazine satire that rendered shirley booth's sitcom "hazel" a la "strange interlude". but it isn't good.

the movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so very different. it features a cast acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires! this is truly a weird film and an experience i won't forget. the only problem is that the experiment, though in some ways interesting, is generally quite dull and unengaging. in fact, it's amazing that a norma shearer and clark gable film could be this dull! the film is based on a eugene o'neill play and it really does seem quite stagy. in fact, it would have been best just to keep it as a stage production--it just didn't translate at all to the big screen.so this movie is only recommended to die-hard cinemaniacs and those who love gable films so much they just have to see all his films!

eugene o'neill is acclaimed by some as america's leading playwright, but for things like the iceman cometh, long day's journey into night, the emperor jones. strange interlude was a piece of experimentation he concocted where the characters on stage, look aside to the audience and say what they really are thinking and then resume conversation. it was a nine hour production with a dinner break on broadway, so you can safely assume a lot has been sacrificed here.for the screen the voice over regarding the thoughts is used for all the characters. it probably is a technique better suited to the screen. sir laurence olivier did very well with it in his version of hamlet. but bill shakespeare gave olivier a lot better story than o'neill gave his players in this instance.players like clark gable, norma shearer, ralph morgan, may robson, etc. are a lot more animated in most of their films than they are in strange interlude. the story takes place over a 20 year period. norma shearer is a young woman whose intended is killed in world war i. she starts playing around quite a bit, although that part is not shown in this version. she makes the acquaintance of alexander kirkland and his friend clark gable. she also has as a perennial suitor, ralph morgan, a friend of her father's henry b. walthall.she marries kirkland, but then is warned by his mother may robson and shown that insanity gallops in that family to quote another literary work. since kirkland wants kids and shearer and robson think kirkland's train will slip the track if he doesn't get one, gable is recruited for breeding purposes. of course you can see all the complications this can cause and o'neill explores them all.gable is so terribly miscast in an o'neill production, but he was an up and coming player at mgm and did what they told him. shearer does what she can to lift a very dreary story, but she seems defeated at the start. best in the film is possibly robson who puts some real bite in her dialog.strange interlude ran for 426 showings on broadway in 1928-1929 and starred glenn anders and lynn fontanne in the gable and shearer parts. perhaps no one could really have saved the film because two years earlier, groucho marx lampooned the stuffings out of it in animal crackers. after seeing what he did, i don't think the movie going public took it too seriously.and since it's not the best of o'neill, neither could i.

eugene o'neill's 4 and a half hour 1927 play brought to the screen in less than two hours. the play's combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn't aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it, especially norma shearer's nina and ralph morgan's marsden. clark gable as ned darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits gable's range. once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable. the technique used here for the asides is another problem. on stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. here they're done as voiceovers. you'd think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. plus it's difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of groucho marx's hilarious parody version in "animal crackers." added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons (nina's promiscuity is soft-peddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play) and a wretched score (uncredited) that sounds like background music to a turn-of-the-century weepie. o'neill called this film "a dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship," and although "strange interlude" is nowhere near as great as his later "the iceman cometh" and "long day's journey into night," it certainly deserved better than this.

in one sense, i kind of liked this movie because of a 'mindless', positive atmosphere it sort of conveys. i had a problem with an aspect of the plot, but more about that later. first, the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional. the 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. the basic storyline was ok (pretty simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or objectionable. the main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs - kind of a nice fantasy element to have. however, they had a very minimal presence in the movie.outside of that, the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too bogged down in any one place. i liked this about the movie.the problem i had with the plot had to do with the the idea of "stealing". i think this movie may not have been thought out enough - something's wrong especially if this is a kid's movie. i'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). the 'good guys' do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has - so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie.overall, if you have kids, because of a questionable plot aspect i'd consider passing. however, this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter. pass this one if you have any other interesting choices.

if you are a six-year-old boy who's into dinosaurs, you will love this movie. if you are anybody else, you'll be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds. if you want to start picking on things like the acting, the special effects, the dialogue, or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest amount of sense, you'll have plenty of material. if all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid, it will do just fine. that said, there's a lot of kids' entertainment out there that's much smarter, and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults. unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur mood, you're probably better off looking for something else.

for some unknown reason, 7 years ago, i watched this movie with my mother and sister. i don't think i've ever laughed as hard with them before. this movie was sooooo bad. how sequels were produced is beyond me. its been awhile since i last saw this "movie", but the one impression that it has stuck with me over the years has been, "they must have found the script in a dumpster in the backlot of a cheap movie studio, made into a "movie", and decided that it didn't suck enough, and made it worse. i'm pretty sure that they spent all the budget on camera work and the so called "special effects", and then had 13 cents left toward the script and to pay the "actors".

i never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that i subscribe to the hbo service. now i know better! jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part. not that he tried. jack plays his usual wiitches of eastwick type character. unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the american southwest. he is about as believable a cowboy desperado as pee wee herman. there is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails. he is almost to goofy. the remainder of the cast was worse. timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of 1978 and the others appeared to be just happy to be there. my recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry.

this movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices. now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her, but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny. this movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny, it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic. how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me. "i sure enjoyed canning those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it. watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun. i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy "comedy" and am totally baffled by these positive reviews.

marlene dietrich is magnificent as concha perez, the temptress who drives all men to despair in josef von sternberg's "the devil is a woman". her performance has nothing to do with 'acting' in any conventional sense but she's incandescent, a true star in full command of her material. but she's the only good thing about the film, (she's so good she keeps you watching this dross; i doubt if any other actress could have done the same).the story is an appallingly lame melodrama, (surely pierre louys' novel was better), in which dietrich's amoral concha ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel atwill and cesar romero with a stiffness bordering on petrification. and for von sternberg it's an ugly looking movie, (maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter). bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough of it to remake it as "that obscure object of desire" with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all, down to casting two different actresses in the same role. neither film is either director's finest hour and while the bunuel version may be the better film, it is dietrich's 'performance' you remember.

a sadly predictable, clichéd story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. sadly, too, the screenplay is by the once-great experimental novelist john dos passos, from an original by french exotic potboiler pierre louys. this time marlene dietrich is concha, a manipulative, cold-hearted spanish beauty. don pasqual (lionel atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she ditches him. he warns his tall young friend antonio (cesar romero) against her, but to no avail. a duel ensues, concha reproaches pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for, so he doesn't: he points his pistol at the sky, but antonio shoots him. but instead of going off to paris with the young victor, she goes back to the man who would have died for her. with an unexpected bit by edward everett horton as a spanish governor. dietrich plays the part of a spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back, flouncing, tossing her head, and so forth. and she makes faces, and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. the photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room, no consecutive scene of dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change. the carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the sargasso sea.

this is far the most worst film i've seen this year from bollywood so far. i may not lie, my wife liked this film very much. it was not bobby deol or arjun rampal what made this film become unbelievable, but it was amisha patel. she performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where (luckily for her) the hero arjun rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). it amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. from this scene i started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of amisha patel. the way she plays a blind girl is very bad. the only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with. when i saw this film, i respected rani mukherjee more with her performance in the movie black. amisha will never reach this level in performing as an actress.anyway, she falls in love with arjun rampal. it is the cliché story. sudden arjun gets killed by a man who is madly in love with amisha. amisha is in despair, but then bobby enters the movie. he also falls in love with the blind girl. bobby deol is a great actor in my point of view, but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where amisha patel buries it deep into the ground. i must say bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far. bobby grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him. he was so bad in acting in barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get the shivers and believe every word he says. only a movie with high potential like a yash copra film has to meet his way.okay, when amisha also falls in love with bobby, someones enters her life. arjun rampal is not dead! who believes this crap? i don't. why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (shushant singh or aryeman ramsay) and give bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with amitabh bachchan? i'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like bobby to give him a great role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with amisha (bigscreen t.v. face) patel. this movie was so awful, that i regret buying it.

this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. they said this was the man's answer to waiting to exhale...all i'm going to say is that we really didn't respond at all. i couldn't believe that it was actually made. the director should choose another profession, because he can't make a movie. the script wasn't good. it made no sense and was very messy. bet movies are much better than this was, and i was horribly disappointed to see the talented actor terrence in this bad excuse of a movie. if i could turn back the hands of time i wouldn't go back to media play to never buy the movie, i would just keep it wrapped sitting on the shelf, instead of wasting my time watching it.

this movie isn't even good enough for the $1 bin at the grocery store.i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it. guess he couldn't be too choosy about his roles during this time. the movie in itself was hard to sit through. it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline. the "guys night out" had to be the most boring i've ever seen. one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry? even the arguments were hard to follow. most of the acting lacked any depth.i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark.

i could not believe it. this film was a total wast of time out of my life. the title is appropriate. love didn't beat the hell out of me, this film did. i kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something, anything to happen. and nothing ever happened! nothing!! terrence howard couldn't even save this lame piece of work called a film. it was dark, and confused and i didn't get who killed the girlfriend in the end. the tone and pacing of the film was supposed to be building to a dramatic climactic ending. this only served to confuse the audience because the movie just plodded along going no where. if you want pure torture, watch this film.

in the process of boring you with the wordy, rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development, it manages to enforce a few negative black stereotypes out there. at one point i was wondering if jesse helms co-wrote the screenplay.

awful, waste of time. there is no camp or trash value in this one. seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs.how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians? it's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it.could not find anything good about the film. there was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. a few overweight goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene. nothing at all.well, cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark. purpose was probably good: make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood. problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally. it takes talent and an effort to make a "real" movie. ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort. these guys lacked everything. ed wood was a genius compared to these guys.

i have to preface this by saying that i love watching bad movies that are entertaining. this movie delivers 100%. it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen. it is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city (people walking, traffic, the skyline, etc.) that doesn't tie into anything. then there are the overly long 'sex scenes.' these involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each other's bodies. these are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie. this is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called 'barely legal' girls who couldn't be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him. no one had to memorize any lines for this movie, if they aren't clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue. then there's mr creepo. he throws ed wood's name around like he can somehow compare, but he is far far from anything of that quality. he walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on. we couldn't stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified)i give this movie a 1/10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.

bad. personal opinion? the folks who made it? they knew that when they made it. to star in this movie, again my opinion, you needed to meet three criteria ... #1: you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry. makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way. #2: you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards. note that i didn't say you had to do it well. saves on time and paper work. #3: you had to be willing to get naked. gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales. want to watch a better movie? easy. get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself. trust me, you won't do any worse. as vampire movies go, well, this one sucks. and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies ... consider the link between vampires and crosses. now, take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in. ed wood couldn't have planned that kind of an accident any better himself.

like other movies from the worst director ever, ed wood, this movie is very bad but because of that it is also very funny. may be not for everyone, but i laughed a lot. it is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. how do you rate it? as a movie very low, as entertainment at least a little higher.the movie tries to explain what a transvestite is and it does this through a scientist (bela lugosi) and an inspector (lyle talbot) who talks to a doctor (timothy farrell) who knows about these things. the doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. the doctor tels these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide, and because of a headline in the news paper about a sex-change. the first and longest story is about glen (ed wood himself) who is in love and about to marry barbara (dolores fuller) but he has never told her he like to dress as a woman, when he is named glenda. the movie tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. the movie almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being homosexual is, since it keeps telling us the fact that a transvestite is not a homosexual. the second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex-change and not just wants to dress up as a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting.a couple of things make this movie very bad, and therefore laughable. how the story is presented is the first thing, the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion of it all are others. this is not where it ends. the acting is very bad, especially dolores fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a little screen somewhere. every thing she says is funny. the whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs.there is also a sequence where someone walks into a room. the door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. then the door, in what seems to be the same shot although we know it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight. ed wood didn't mind to leave this kind of continuity errors in his movie. may be a good thing, because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience. i think you understand that it is a bad movie and i think there is a good chance you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes as well.

as many know, this is the feature film debut of edward d. wood jr. as as a writer/producer/director/actor. i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now. while i don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life. everybody knows that he was a transvestite. this film is about changing one's sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it. however, the film still contains wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialog, meaningless stock footage, and hokey special effects. throw in wood's usual overdose of bela lugosi hamming it up and you have wood's first attempt at being a director.the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines. the doctor tells him the story of glen, who is also a transvestite. glen wants to marry barbara, but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret. he also tells the inspector about alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman. bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on (lugosi's part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cash).all in all, the movie shows the hallmarks of wood's career. it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly. it definitely has the "it's so bad, it's good" feel to it. however, i do have to applaud ed on his progressive thinking in making this film. transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s. wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on cross-dressing.

i just recently watched ed wood jr.'s autobiographical movie glen or glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years. nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw. this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made. stampeding buffalo, women in bondage, satan prancing around and bela lugosi, rambling only as he can, "bevare, bevare....pull the string, pull the string...", it was totally insane. the acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious, exactly what one would expect from an ed wood film. having said all that, as horrible as this movie was, i have to give wood credit...he was way ahead of his time. you have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less the subject for a movie. i have read that wood was a transvestite in real life, and i'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. it was sad to see bela lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was kind of ed wood jr. to at least give mr. lugosi an acting job at a time in bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in hollywood would hire him. if you have never seen this film then you have to see it, especially if you are a fan of ed wood jr.

directed and written by the famous/infamous edward d. wood jr, using a pseudonym(daniel davis)playing the lead role of glen/glenda. this is an almost radical documentary about transvestism; wood himself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. it seems miles of stock footage and an incoherent bela lugosi is used to stretch this odd and awkward film to 67 minutes. police inspector(lyle talbot)seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist, dr. alton(timothy farrell), to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites.also in the cast: delores fuller, "tommy" hanes, captain dezita and wood's sister evelyn. of note: farrell also acts as narrator. and fuller later helped write songs included in the elvis presley movies blue hawaii, kissin' cousins & kid galahad.

considering the film’s reputation as truly the worst of the worst, i was looking forward to watching wood’s crappus opus (my word); it’s not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i’ve watched – however, being from the reefer madness (1938) school of film-making, glen or glenda doesn’t come across as readily ‘enjoyable’ as his genre efforts.also, this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi’s nadir (his first of three ‘collaborations’ with the director): one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was (considering the actor’s history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo). besides, lugosi’s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here…though wood’s script is mostly to blame for this – given the impossible dialogue (with repeated nonsensical allusions to “puppy-dog tails” and “big fat snails”) he handed the ailing star! by the way, wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym daniel davis) – and, being just as worthless in this area, proves to have been an all-round dog!; dolores fuller – his wife and co-star – was similarly untalented (she would also appear in jail bait [1954])…but, at the very least, the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton’s affectionate biopic ed wood (1994) its famous poster! incidentally, the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles – well, for all intents and purposes, glen or glenda constitutes ed wood’s citizen kane (1941) given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques: in fact, the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore (many of it irrelevant, such as the bewildering instances of s&m) and inane dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy)! the film’s sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction/phenomenon of transvestism is, however, sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach.for what it’s worth, the edition i watched was the “extended re-issue version” which included six minutes of ‘depraved’ footage (directed by w. merle connell) censored on original release! furthermore, my copy went out-of-synch every so often (which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track) – though, thankfully, this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself.

i saw the biopic of ed wood many years ago. tim burton payed loving homage to this extremely untalented but yet enthusiastic filmmaker.then i saw plan 9 and it actually tickled me to no end. a silly story, kind of bad production values but still entertaining and even funny.then this. what can you make of it. well, since wood has been reported as being a cross-dresser it is startling to see a movie that deals with it like a cartoon. yes, there are some stabs at teaching the audience something about the subject but mostly this is some kind of really twisted self-parody.one of it's problems is that it has a hundred points of view. on one hand it is a plea for tolerance. another portrays transvestism as a disease. and finally, it tells the audience: "okay, if you are schocked now, then wait until you see this!" the problem must have been that wood had to compromise in order for the film to be made. you can almost sense it when you see the opening title from the producer: personally supervised by... so, where are we. this is neither a serious subject movie or an all-out schocker.the entertainment value is practically nil. the wooden voice-over is mildly amusing but only because it sounds so misguided. this was made in the 50s though, so one can argue that was brave making a film that even mentioned the word transvestites. it all comes down to what the film itself is trying to advocate against. schock. the rape scene, while mild is there simply to do that.so, sorry. this is a misfire but the discredit is not wood's alone.

let me say this about edward d. wood jr. he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have. if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood, the world would probably be a much better place. being familiar with ed wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic "ed wood" (1994) several times, i admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved; i still admire his never-say-die attitude. he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern-day hollywood had.but that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch. and "glen or glenda," his first and most confessional film, is probably his very worst."glen or glenda" is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named glen (played by director/writer ed wood himself) who despite his love for his fiancée barbara (dolores fuller), cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes...glenda! glen/glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called "the scientist" played by veteran horror star bela lugosi. oh, and there's also some sub-story about an alan/anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the christine jorgenson story, upon whom this movie originally titled "i changed my sex!" was previously to be based.have i dropped your jaw yet? well, as much as i want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it, i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis i just gave you. every thing in it is true. this is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner. i'm sure that with a good screenplay, and a good director (it had neither) that "glen or glenda," despite the subject matter, could have been a very moving picture. it is a confessional movie on wood's part, as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. but once again, that does not make it a good movie...or a watchable one for that matter. "glen or glenda" is a jumbled, disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. it makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where bela lugosi screams "pull the string!" over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison. the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films i've seen before. it's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens. the only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film, but personally, i couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be. i'll tell you what he was: a gifted actor who wound up making trash. but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other, so good for him.i will always admire edward d. wood jr. for his passion for the cinema, but i will never as long as i live admire his movies. a film critic once called ed wood's movies "innocent fun" but i think even that is questionable. innocent? yes. fun? no, sir. and if "citizen kane" is the mount everest of the cinematic world, then "glen or glenda" is probably the mariana trench.

whew! what can one say about this bizarre, stupefying mock-u-mentory about ed wood's cross-dressing fantasies?? well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! wood uses raw slabs of innocuous, incidental stock footage, and then builds a "story" around them - and what a story!! wood himself stars as glen, a regular joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee's lingerie and sweaters. i think what wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the glens of this world by showing that glen is just like all of us underneath, only in angora. ummm...ok. but then, we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated bela lugusi,playing some kind of twisted, invalid puppetmaster. lugosi is a howl, spouting out such rubbish as "beeevaaare...the beeeg greeeen dragon that seeets at your doorstep: he eeeets leeetle boys, puppydog tails, and beeeeeg snails!" um, ok, bela... :=8/ there is a strange, twisted type of wood logic going on here. afterall, he does remind us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bald". hmmm, must be that alien/cross-dressing/habidashery cowspiracy-thang!! glen or glenda stars a plethora (whatever that is...) of reliable wood schlock-actors, including lyle talbot, delores fuller, and timothy farrell, and wood manages to coax every bit of wretched, amateurish non-talent out of each one. everybody by now knows bela's sad story: by the time wood used him for this flic, he was probably jonesing for another fix and needed the moolah, but even for him this is depth heretofore unreached. one of the moocow's favorite wood mooments comes with the stock footage charging buffalo scene - it is sooo loopily demented!! the moocow says "puuuull de schtriiiiings", and git yer hooves on a copy of glen or glenda - you won't believe it! :

"glen or glenda" was edward d. wood jr's first attempt at directing a feature film. for this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart...transvestism, the "art" of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes. to his credit, wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953. unfortunately, wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film.the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite glen/glenda (daniel davis aka ed wood). inspector warren (lyle talbot) with the help of psychiatrist dr. alton (timothy farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) this way.glen is engaged to barbara (dolores fuller) and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession. and that's it. we see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either glen or glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window. poor old bela, who was down on his luck and befriended by wood, keeps popping in throughout the story. i'm not 100% sure but i think bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed.to add to the confusion of lugosi's narration, farrell as dr. alton also provides off screen narration. lugosi keeps saying, bevare, bevare...take care, take care, as well as, some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails.the story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and wood's character(s). the dream sequences are laughable. a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors(?) fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination, risqué for 1953.this film along with wood's other "classics" were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. for that reason, they have survived to this day.

and generally speaking, you will eventually have to research this little gem. when describing i changed my sex, or glen or glenda as it is better known, i must echo the thoughts of andrew smith, who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote "if you haven't seen any of ed wood's other movies, this one is a completely bewildering experience. if you have seen any of ed wood's movies, this is still completely bewildering". the film is both hilarious and tragic, yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. wood, bless him, had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director, wanting to promote peace, understanding, and even acceptance, in the 1950s of all times. when tim burton recreated a viewing of glen or glenda by studio execs for his biopic, he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put-on. more than fifty years later, there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the "normal" take for granted, so i say it most certainly is not.no, the real comedy in glen or glenda is the sheer ineptitude wood displays in composing his message. directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes, and can be edited to fit with their own footage. ed wood used stock footage indiscriminately, and tim burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which wood as played by johnny depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. sadly, the real ed wood died before he had a chance, but glen or glenda is the closest he ever came. the imdb states that twenty percent of this sixty-something minute film is stock footage, and it is never difficult to guess which footage. footage of busy highways, planes flying overhead, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, they're all used in a haphazard manner, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story wood is trying to tell. had wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while, there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved.wood himself appears in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named glenda. aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point, wood makes one hideous woman. having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks i am "disabled" and need to be "cured" myself, i honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for wood's character. in order to make his point, however, wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. one of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman, the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide. the scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia, very little of the film would even need to be changed. that is how little society has learned since ed wood was a boy.the other significant personality in glen or glenda is bela lugosi, whom wood shoehorned into the film. speculation varies upon wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that wood wanted to help revive lugosi's career, and would do anything in order to achieve this. with the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film, that is. in glen or glenda, wood makes usage of lugosi that was best described in flying saucers over hollywood as "bizarre". lugosi plays a character billed as the scientist, but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master. people who have not seen ed wood films before the biopic will think tim burton made up the "beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep" speech. if anything, burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting wood-ian dialogue. nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context, not even criswell's hilarious ranting during plan 9 from outer space.observant types will also note the presence of delores fuller, wood's girlfriend at the time. again, burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward-thinking. i cannot help but feel that burton's portrayal is more accurate, as fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. she only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast-mates, if such a thing is possible. whether wood's direction was better-focused in this case than usual is hard to determine, but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of bela) in the dust is any guide, then it should come as no surprise that fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other wood film. that she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. while wood would appear before the camera again, it was never as more than a cameo, a walk-on, or a bit-part.i gave glen or glenda a one out of ten. i generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result. bold and well-intentioned as it was, glen or glenda fits that description to a t.

i agree with one commentator who says that it's really impossible to review glen or glenda? objectively. if one does so, the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious, convoluted dialog, the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values. yet, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds. it isn't the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. it's not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic.no, what makes glen or glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so-called auteur directors like hitchcock or godard, despite their vastly superior talents, never did. in glen or glenda, wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film. indeed, the conclusion of the film suggest that ed wood's glen character will be able to "kill" his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife, barbara. the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference, glenda will disappear. so, while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general, he wasn't so sure of desiring it for himself.moreover, wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. if it didn't cohere, so what? what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed wood's imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness.the only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i don't think can be rated.

sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap, the one and only bela lugosi looks into the camera and, in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of shakespeare, intones sloooow-ly: "man's constant groping of things unknown, drawing from the endless reaches of time, brings to light many startling things; (snicker); startling?, because they seem new (lugosi's eyes now bulging, with raised eyebrows, and mouth sneering, he continues) but most are not new, the signs of the ages" (cue a visual of lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to rumble for an astonishing 86 seconds).and so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made. this "movie" almost defies description. told in semi-docudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot ... such as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named glen (ed wood, jr.) who cross-dresses; hence the reference to glenda. the film has no real structure. instead, it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to glen or to the cross-dressing motif. one long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as s&m.then, at odd moments bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and babbles more inane dialogue, like: "when he's wrong because he does right, and when he's right because he does wrong; pull the string, dance to that." huh?about twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage, accompanied by a vo that relates to the story motif but not the visuals. hence, we see stock footage of: bustling city streets, freeway traffic, a thunderous herd of buffalo, and a playground full of kids. but it gets worse. in a film about cross-dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from wwii.even the simplest items are botched. in one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads "man nabbed dressed as girl". underneath the headline, which has clearly been glued or pasted on, the article is about ... taxes. in one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman spouts out: "airplanes, why it's against the creator's will", in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium.except for the performance of lyle talbot, the acting is uniformly horrendous. production design is cheap looking and drab; (but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper). the editing is sloppy. most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators. the b&w cinematography has way too much contrast. and the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store.this film is so bad it makes "plan 9 from outer space" look like "citizen kane", by comparison. i just don't know how one could make a film any worse than ed wood's "glen or glenda". but thankfully, it's got bela lugosi in it. every time he opened his mouth, and gazed into the camera with those big, bulging eyes, i about fell on the floor laughing.

this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! ok so pros and cons. pros beautiful setting in hawaii, looks good on bluray. cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. predictable poor plot. zero character development. forced jokes which fall flat. many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap.

i endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity. it has to be one of the worst films i have ever sat through. i am amazed that this film currently has a 7.5 star rating. the acting is awful, script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. for a funny film i cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. i sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.

i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. after seeing the trailer i thought - what an unfunny movie full of clichés. but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. what a waste of time... the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, i couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies, but that also is pretty passé. i couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because i found them utterly stupid. the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally.

this movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me wanna scream: "lame". nicholas stoller write the movie "yes man", but direct "this" maybe he should stick with writing.i am so disappointed because i heard all the great review. i was expecting something like knocked up. they say this is from the maker of "knocked up"? why can't i see the resemblance? but this just felt like a shallow, overdone-theme kind of movie for me. i am so disappointed. actually it's not bad if you consider it as your-average-chick-movie, but that character of the "band guy" just get on my nervesmaybe i was just not paying enough attention to the movie, but yeah they have some funny lines and scene, but i don't felt the originality. and the ending make the movie a little bit better. at least the ending is not some boring cliché one.

this movie was bad but it was so bad that it may reach cult status in the distant future. a sort of film-noir meets plan 9 from outer space. the story was, well, there wasn't actually a story. there is a place reserved for the ed woods and russ meyers of the world and this film proves it. "so bad it might be good" is the best way to describe it. i seriously doubt if this movie will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company therefore it is unlikely to see wide release.i will add that i expect to see more of actor ron carey. he made the best of what he had. the rest of the acting, if i can call it that, was quite forgettable. i have seen worse from big studios with vast budgets.

yeah, i know his character was supposed to be a drunk, and he may have been just acting goofy. but something tells this critic that mr. pleasence really was drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film. basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible. or maybe it was just the poor productions values... hard to say.anyway, the race for the yankee zephyr is a film that just doesn't work. that's a shame, too, since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot. ultimitely the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this new zealand adventure to deliver the goods. the story deals with a us war plane which is filled with gold, money, and medals, which crashes into a lake in new zealand during wwii. the plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk (pleasence) literally stumbles onto it. at first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town, actually getting $75 apiece for them! little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane. before you can blink, all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals. the old drunk's business partner (wahl) and his daughter (warren) then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. the resulting action just isn't as fun as you'd hope it would be.the acting is rather awful, save for pleasence. george peppard tries to do some kind of (i guess) austrailian accent, but it is hardly convincing. lesley ann warren isn't too bad, but ken wahl is really bad. he's basically doing his best impression of michael pare on his worst day. and that's saying something. hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked. i don't recall if he'd had them straightened by the time he was in wiseguy. the rest of the cast are pretty untalented. probably mostly locals who never did much else. i guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film, and the lack of danger. the villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. and honestly, there are no helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the dvd cover. and none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them, either.the film does have its strengths, though. the beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. brian may's score sounds a little too much like the one in mad max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for pleasence in some scenes. sounds just like the one in the great escape! there are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. the scenery, despite the grainy look of the picture, is still quite beautiful. the thing you'll remember most is the drunken antics of donald pleasence, though. he was almost enough to save this film. almost. 4 of 10 stars.the hound.

at the opposite end of the spectrum from raiders of the lost ark is david hemmings' utterly inferior adventure regarding the salvage of a world war ii-era plane with a valuable cargo. assets include beautiful new zealand settings, brian may's energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases. the bad, however, far outweighs the good. donald pleasence hams as perhaps never before; half of his dialog is almost unintelligible. george peppard attempts an australian (i think) accent, then gives it up halfway through. lesley ann warren is at her most irritating. ken wahl is, well, ken wahl. the dialog is painful to hear and hemmings' direction is largely inept. the script is not only obvious but terrible. jokes fall flat, scenes carry no punch and continuity is virtually non-existent. according to the end credits, two men were killed piloting jet boats during the making of the film. what a waste.

first off, the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a new zealand lake, inside a downed world war 2 plane is a great opening. what follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel. men chasing men, cars chasing men , helicopters chasing men, helicopters chasing boats, boats chasing boats, for the better part of an hour, the most boring nonsense, with absolutely no advancement to the story. special mention must be made of the chop shop editing, as many scenes seem to have been spliced together in random order. the acting by all concerned is an embarrassment. one last thing, the picture quality and sound quality is so bad on this dvd that you will be appalled. - merk

what a script, what a story, what a mess!

one of the worst films i have ever seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose though). every scene that contains anything to do with; aircraft, romance, script or acting is badly messed up.i recommend this film for all pilots, it´s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film (also see airport 79:the concorde, for the same reason).anyone else, avoid this film like the plague (except for fans of b-movies, of course)enjoy

although i have rarely flown myself, i am keenly interested in aviation... and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinema.1. why is the captain doing the ground checks? why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines? with turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre-flight check.2. why does the captain kick against the aircraft tire? strange kind of pressure check. or anger management :-)3. the cockpit has a crew of 3. all large, western, two-engined jets built since the 1980ies have a crew of 2 people. now try a guess at how old the movie script is.4. a helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner. must be a fast one... and the captain's words to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones!5. with arrested elevator rudders it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. it happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed.6. the elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators. after the collision with the business plane it would, most probably, have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering, but it would not fix them in certain position.7. the fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea. it was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do that  the flight attendant.8. at the time of collision, the aircraft's elevators would have been in a neutral position. the film could have ended here...9. the flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. in reality, flight engineers have two.10. why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind? i thought it would have been the flight engineer's duty, as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flight.11. in any aircraft, there is no unused space. at least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water.i could go on and on... but at last i laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters! woooohooo! most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90-minute flicks out of them. but you can always fill 90 minutes with mind-boggling and insane crap, irrespective of the genre.

you've got to watch this movie! it is so bad it actually is great.you've got your crazy but gutsy captain who of course is having an affair with his worn out used to be gorgeous copilot. and of course the mid air collision occurs when the captain's enemy and rivalis along for the ride to geyou've got your ex vietnam vet who is can't handle the pressure of another mid air collision and crash landing. then you've got your old crazy army air corp buddy who is flying the chase plane and trying to well i can't tell you what he's trying to do. the plane keeps going up, up and well and then you've got your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then you've got your ice station zebra cold and then lucky saves the bad guy from drowing so they can land the plane! and it doesn't end --- it just goes on and on! you've got to watch this. it's great! you've got to be kidding! did they actually show this on commercial television and how it was ever shown on cable.

weak tale of an evil warlock who is searching for a centuries old satanic bible so that he can do lucifer's bidding by undoing creation. hot in pursuit all the way is a 17th centruy bounty hunter named redfern and his reluctant sidekick kassandra. sound like a load of bunkum? it is.this drivel from writer d.t. twohy gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director steve miner (who helmed that romantic nonsense "forever young"). twohy obviously knows nothing about true evil.julian sands just flies around and cackles, trying to look evil, while richard e. grant succeeds only in wasting his rich talent. lori singer's career also took a nosedive with this one.special effects crew has some fun, and jerry goldsmith provides a score superior to its subject matter.

two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. that's the first scene, and it made me wince, fearing what was in store. but by the end of the first half hour i was all swept up in the flood of images. not because i cared in the least about any of the characters but because i was aghast at how execrable the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink.frank (remar) and red (woolvett) are the ex-inmates. after murdering the two innocent campers they plow through the woods and wangle their way into the isolated cabin of dean stockwell and his two sons, the attorney keith and the estranged homosexual behr. the escapees at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identities.well, it looks like familiar territory so far. "desperate hours," or "funny games" maybe. but -- hang on -- the gay son is in cahoots with the two. it seems that stockwell, upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named billy, kicked billy around and threw him out. billy went on to die and behr now blames his dad for the death. and, indeed, dad is something of a neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias, the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding.the grief-stricken behr just searched and searched, looking for someone else who had known billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. it turned out to be one of the escapees, and now behr is determined to see them to their freedom.it gets all twisted after that. people talk. they talk and talk. they talk continually. and not about the two mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes. no -- the dialog goes something like, "you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own son." that's behr, the young gay guy, talking to stockwell. it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker.the only real performance is given by james remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees. and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone, which sounds like lance henrickson's, and his wide guppy-like lips. he's easy on the eyes and ears.dean stockwell has given decent performances, including his inestimable bizarro turn in "blue velvet," in which he was my supporting player, but here laziness, advancing years, or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype. it's as if he were reading stage directions -- "look surprised" and "shout angrily" -- and following them literally. there's not a surprise in a cartload.if the gay son, jason behr, ever blinked, it must have been while i was blinking at the same time because i missed it. he has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument. woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pine-knot paneled woodwork. the attorney son is robert glen keith. i hope he didn't quit his day job.the direction is pedestrian, the staging functional without being in the least innovative. sometimes it's confusing. i lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin's porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun. i also couldn't understand how stockwell could put a blast through the cabin's door, hit remar, and knock him in a back flip off the porch, and then remar could simply stand up, dust himself off, and come up with a cranky riposte like, "okay. two can play that game." but why go on? see it if you must.

i am an indian residing in the united states. why india continues, like a dumb animal, to emulate everything american is beyond me!! the main problems with the movie aren't so much the inane plot and dumb comedy. it is that this movie has a lot of sex, touching, women dressing like strumpets in the streets, and a lot of cursing that doesn't belong anywhere on t.v.to the producers and directors of this movie, i have this message: you continue to weaken our nation's strong family values by making this sort of junk. you continue to let young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. you continue to make dance songs that belong in the lowest of adult clubs and bars. i am ashamed to be an indian after seeing movies like this.in 2003, the united states government suggested that the best way to destroy iran is to 'send miniskirts' there. there is no need to do that for india. we will destroy ourselves with rubbish like this.

oh my god that has got to be one of the most useless brainless stupidest comedy ever made!! what has happened to subhash ghai, even apna sapna money money was worth watchingeww! god this movie stinksdo not watch it save your money bad movie bad cast bad jokes bad acting, even this movie is an example of shoe polish being rubbed on a facetrust me this movie does even make you smile, vulgar jokes, cheap jokes,a really stupid movie with no conceptsrating 0 on 10awful movie those are the two hours im never getting back....syed shabbir aly naqvi of pakistan

if you have plenty of time to kill and the dvd was given to you by your friend for free but still it may require lot of courage to watch this film which does not have good script or humor for that matter.on the acting front imran is frozen in time/acting, tushar kapoor was slightly better than imran in this movie paresh rawal was good at comedy was usual. the story revolves around a college campus where imran is a bad boy n tushar is the good one, they pretend to be the opposite of respective nature and so the story goes on.....watch it only if you don't have any thing to do and the film is running on your local cable tv.

wow. as soon as i saw this movie's cover, i immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. sometimes i watch bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining (eg. koi mil gaya). this movie had all the elements of an atrocious film: a "gang of local thugs" that is completely harmless, a poorly done motorcycle scene, horrible dialouge ("congrats son, i am very proud that you are a bad boy"), actors playing basketball as if they are good, atrocious songs ("me bad, me bad, me bad bad boy"), unexplained plot lines like why are the good boy and bad boy friends??? and why is the hot girl in love with the nerd?? i've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly. some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the good and bad boys inexplicably ran over the "gang member's" poker game. congrats ashwini chaudry, you are a bad director. if you want to watch a good movie, watch guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining, then watch good boy, boy.

can u believe a college professor made this film?????the same man who made dhoopthe film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes everthe main message is nice but presented badlythe film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performancesdirection and everything is poormusic is okayemraan's naughty streak works and he does well tusshar is bad tanushree and isha are bad paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror

it's really a shame there was so much controversy surrounding this picture (in other words, the infamous affair between ingrid bergman and roberto rossellini), as this drew a lot of attention to a very forgettable film. the story is incredibly slow, cheap looking and uninteresting. and, to top this off, the film is stuffed to the brim with amateurish actors who can barely speak any english. i really would have preferred subtitles--it would have made the experience less exhausting. back to the rotten acting. the neo-realist movement was big in italy at the time this film was made. many of these films are absolute masterpieces (such as de sica's umberto d., the children are watching us and miracle in milan) because they got so much out of the non-professional actors. they behaved like normal people, but in stromboli they act like normal people trying to be actors and come off very badly--like kids in a school play. by the way,...if you are hoping the movie has a good ending (thereby making your time commitment to the film worth while), don't bother. the plot was just totally uninvolving and silly--so much so, that i really found that i could have cared less about the characters. like the island they all inhabit, the film is desolate and without color or life.

why bother to see this movie? it probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since clark gable's laughable playing of an irish patriot in parnell.it's inconceivable that bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time. to begin with, there was no script to work with except a few notes. then we are supposed to believe the polished bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor italian fisherman she doesn't even love. i read where anna magnani was the original choice for this part. if so, that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous bergman in such a proletarian part. but since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window.so she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea. a place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in.her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion, and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day. on top of all of this, there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. but like a true heroine, bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film. she even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. to her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery. i won't bother to tell you how this all ends. the no-script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of stromboli. i even remember (from seeing it on late night tv) that it had two different endings! so be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the miscast bergman. it led to her downfall in hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to peter lindstrom. none of the movies she made with this director(whom she later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk. i kid you not. it's pretty embarrassing.- - soundtrack

my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit sicily and stromboli soon. fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and seascape (complete with tuna) are the only believable members of this cast. we expected reasonable well-written and well-acted movie, but were disappointed. its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: thrashing tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars, and passionate, if superstitious, fishermen.the movie's sequencing is stagy, its dialogue stilted, and the acting ranges from stiff to completely "over-the-top." one scene, in which bergman stresses out as her macho, native and naïve husband sics his ferret on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be perfect grist for a monty python skit.when the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the casts'). unfortunately, the movie continues to flail on, staggering finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending. unless you're really into old-time tuna fishing, pass this hokey effort by.

before the days of home video, stan laurel's pre-hardy comedy 'kill or cure' was known -- to the extent that it was known at all -- only because a few sequences were included in robert youngson's compilation film 'laurel and hardy's laughing 20's'. youngson knew what he was doing: the best gags in 'kill or cure' were brought intact into his compilation, while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on youngson's cutting-room floor.laurel portrays a commercial traveller, hawking a patent medicine cried professor i.o. dine's knox-all: that name is the funniest joke in this movie, which ain't sayin' much. i should point out that this movie dates from 1923, the shank of prohibition. during prohibition, quite a lot of americans purchased patent medicine if it had (ahem!) 'medicinal' properties, so -- if knox-all contains alcohol -- stan's job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie famously had in 'big business', selling christmas trees in the summer. too bad for this movie that it's not nearly so funny as 'big business'.we see stan (but don't hear him, in this silent film) delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention ... until we learn that they're standing outside a deaf-mute institution, and this man is deaf. a haughty woman emerges from the gates: stan quickly tries to engage her attention by wiggling his fingers at her. of course she's not deaf, and she promptly whacks him with her umbrella. i found this sequence offensive, not because it involves deaf people (the deaf aren't the butt of the joke) but because it abets the very widely-held misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely waggling their fingers randomly and performing charades without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language.more amusingly, a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named rudolph (as in valentino), and there's a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object that's narrower than his body. i've seen this device in several cartoons and live-action movies but 'kill or cure' is, i think, the earliest movie to use it that i've seen so far.stan laurel, an under-rated actor, does one bit of physical business here that's worthy of chaplin or keaton, in which he conveys his emotions -- and a change in his demeanour -- while walking away from the camera with his back to us. still, laurel never really became a first-rate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever. 'kill or cure' barely rates 3 out of 10.

i hadn't seen this in many years. the acting was so good as i began this time, i thought, "great! another movie i misjudged as a foolish young man." but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way.this was hollywood, the seat of glamor; so the concept shouldn't be a surprise. but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it. in brief, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive.dorothy mcguire is likable as the homely heroine. she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make-up. robert young is injured in the war and feels scarred. his parents can't bear to look at him either. he seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are outmoded.herbert marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. his character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient.the best performance is given by mildred natwick as the owner of the title residence. she is bitter and dour but not made of ice. her story is much more interesting, and believable, than that of mcguire and young.

this is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. the enchanted cottage delivers dorothy mcguire as a "terrible ugly" spinster and robert young as a disfigured pilot. long story short: scarface marries spinster, after which their love transforms them, miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of fake scars), into beautiful peoplea magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymooners.if the story stopped there, fine; it would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. but it lurches ahead, reaching for reality. when mr. and mrs. scarface greet their public, it comes as a painful shock to them that they're still homely. you see, they only appear beautiful to each other a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that ill-favored people really need to lower their expectations, and find other ways to be happy. you know. take up hobbies. spinster does woodcuts, for instance. scarface considers collecting driftwood.the original playwright (arthur wing pinero) and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature. their message is: you're either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one. what's even worse, ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty. reality just won't do.one wonders what elaine mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, stephen hawking.

usa's azn tv purchased the rights to this film and the network is showing it using the english title the pickpocket.1997's the pickpocket takes amateur home-movie style movie making to amazing levels of unpleasantness. the movie depicts a long-winded series of boring wanderings of an uninteresting, confused guy. this lead character, xiao wu, does not simply walk about aimlessly. viewers will unfortunately soon realize that xiao wu has an unsurpassed talent to seek out, and remain dormant near the most obnoxious noises to be found in china. clanging empty tin buckets being beaten with a stick -- he is there. every old motor in china clunking in agony -- he is there. a crying baby? yes, you guessed it, he is there! according to the pickpocket, china is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet earth.the only element worse than the sound of the pickpocket is the photography. the camera shakes, shakes and shakes some more. finally, the camera stills, but then it falls to the actor's knees and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again. most of the shaky film is framed in distant, long, long, long shots. the few times when the camera gets somewhat close, nothing compelling ever takes place to connect the viewer with what is happening.the photography is murky, faded and often blurry. the use of color is -- well, there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color. most every shot is held 20 times too long. few movies are so painful to sit through. this film is painful to watch, and painful to hear. and then it simply ends.john woo fans might enjoy being able to hear part of the soundtrack to die xue shuang xiong (the killer) as the lead character is hanging outside of a video store for many minutes. anyway, be warned -- the pickpocket will steal away your good time.

this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about bebe's kids is told in the opening. i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see. liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfeld's jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie. this movie had to be self-serving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar. whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.

my brother was working at a movie theater when i saw this movie; i saw it for free and still walked out. i have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst. when people ask me what the worst movie i have ever seen was i mention this movie in less than one second. this movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set-up to the next, it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful. if you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie. okay, this movie is not good "bad" but terrible bad. if you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you will not even be able to make it through this very short film. please for the love of god destroy all copies of this movie.

it's as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time. this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film, which is obviously far superior to this trash. it's clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be mano a mano, man against man, instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes. at this point in the film, the characters just don't act like regular people and not even like their own personalities. it makes little sense. it's quite clear why this film flopped. it's just not believable at all and that's too bad - it started out with promise. don't be fooled.

"tank girl" was, i suppose, meant to be the "buckaroo banzai" of the 90's and was marketed as such. the comparison is, admittedly, appropriate; both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that, as impossible as the story is to sort out, it certainly isn't boring."tank girl" is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts. otherwise you'll end up with a skull-cracking headache like me.

if this is the best commander hamilton movie, i have no curiosity about the others.a movie actor's greatest tools are his eyes, but when peter stormare wants to show great emotion, he closes his, so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them. lousy acting technique.stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun, turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut. watch carefully. james bond can rest easy with competition like this.there are some interesting supporting performances from other actors, but not enough to hang a whole movie on. the cinematography is good-looking, doing a fine job of capturing the nordic cold. even the sahara winds up looking cold. perhaps hamilton carries his own climate with him.there are some individual good action sequences here. unfortunately, the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain, which turns the hero into a big pill. james bond's jokes may not be particularly good, but at least he doesn't look constipated all the time.one positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic, contorted, vicious hatred of israel in guillou's books has been left out. what has been kept in is worship of a noble, heroic plo, that he shows us functioning in libya without the dictator khaddafi's knowledge or supervision. this fantasy is hard to believe, since khaddafi actually threw the plo out of libya for four years at a time. and at the end of the film, hamilton gives the plo a very disturbing gift. where will they use that gift? hamilton doesn't care.we're a long, long way away from "for whom the bell tolls" here.commander hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. while henning mankell's books sell well around the world, jan guillou will never have the same success.as for this film, bleeeeaaahhhhh.

another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden, it doesn´t work, except for widerbergs still unsurpassed mannen på taket. stormare does the best he can, i suppose, and some scenes are mildly effective, but the plot is full of holes. why does hamilton continue the attack on the base, knowing that his wife is held hostage? it was fun to see mark hamill, but his bad guy-part was very underwritten. i´m constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible, functioning script. 1 out of 5.

this movie changes its way a third of the way in.its totally pointless boring and stupid.i hated this movie so much that i will never watch it again.some bad films can be really funny. this is just a british art house picture that should never of been made.1 out of 10

i am still not sure what the hell this movie is about. i guess the boy was afraid of becoming blind and began imagining all sorts of strange things. this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother , however , or the unrelenting boredom found within this film. while watching this movie you will wish you were blind so you did not have to see this experiment in futility. skip this steaming pile and opt for anything else at the video store ..... anything else.

i would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes of lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! yep. and you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless, meaningless, and pretty much ignored for the rest of the film!this movie is populated by dull people who do dull things, and the dullest person of them all is young lucas, who is going blind and needs an operation. you see, he has delusions, terrible delusions! he thinks a killer is preying on blind women! he walks around a lot and acts like an insufferable jerk!patience does not pay off with this film. by the end, the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very hard to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant. nothing is made clear, the film moves at a snail's pace, and it left me with the same effects of a hangover.judging from "afraid of the dark," the british don't make stupid thrillers like the americans do; they make boring ones.

afraid of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written, all too short for a feature length film, then spliced together clumsily into this frankenstein's monster.at his best, the protagonist, lucas, is creepy. as hard as it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters, they're far more sympathetic.afraid of the dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through -- and had it made lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off-putting. i wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life.

there's not that much to say in the end. one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past. it just seems like he did it without actually caring. the actors are doing their job (though belmondo is far from amazing), but you just don't get hooked. in a word, it's boring. this is even more disappointing since i heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big american blockbusters, which are considered to be a threaten to the french exception by those who just can't admit they should turn to another job. i tell you, if that's the best reaction we're supposed to get, boy, i'm going to be really depressed soon...

let me get started with a terrible storyline and an awful control system. good animation but not too good graphics. that is why i'm giving this game 4 of 10. this game really needs an improvement if you ask me!!! i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control. if i made it to improve it i would make those graphics look better than on the movie. it will drive anyone crazy when you are getting killed so freaking easy. i played this and got killed by a diver when he had one of those flick knives in 2 hits. the dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks some fat ass. sorry about all the cussing i think i'm done now. it just that this game sucks so bad that it should be taken off the store's shelf. i dare you to play the garbage and you will probably get so mad by dieing so easy so don't play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said "let's make fun of the russians and at the same time show people how advanced we (americans) are". the movie portrays the russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the americans. it is true that american campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are. however, this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between east and west. to me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the cold war.

ok everybody is so enthused by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie.i have to say first i saw the film in russian language overdub so i will have missed some dialog, but not much.nice things first. there are some hilarious moments (the elvis impersonator for instance). actors seem well casted, also the russians. efremova is great and goldblum is very good. which brings us to the downsides of this movie. first of all. there is hardly any story and the end we know already: yeltsin wins. so no drama or suspense. they tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the actors mentioned above, but that story kind of evaporates.more importantly, the film does not represent reality. the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous lot. i am willing to believe that flying in some spin-doctors from the states helped yeltsin win his campaign, but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are: who financed the campaign, what did they get in return, how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials?so what we have here is a film, loosely based on reality (but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without plot or subplot.

when you read the comment on this film, that it's smart and funny political comedy based on true events - the only true word here is that it's a comedy. if you're told it's insider movie about russian politics - it's not. there's probably only 2% in the movie from what really happened in russia during that election-campaign. in reality of the 1996 it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky election-campaign. well, there were pr-advisers from the us working in the yeltsin's staff, but their role was just minimal. the whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie, it would be much funnier showing all the president's people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash, and the celebrities giving the shows to support yeltsin all over the place - at least that would be true. i give it three only because of the respect to jeff goldblum, antony lapagglia, and liev schreiber. and about the machine guns on the streets of moscow. i was living in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in russia in the middle of 90-s and never seen a man with the gun on the street.

johnnie (bert wheeler) is a would-be songwriter; newton (robert woolsey) is a would-be inventor. both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. johnnie wants to sell a song to winfield lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. lake's secretary, mary (betty grable), is johnnie's sweetheart. when lake turns up dead, circumstances conspire to make mary and newton think that johnnie is the killer. they conspire again to implicate mary, who goes to jail. but who really shot lake? who is the black widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? the other characters in this wacky murder mystery are: lake's suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow-witted janitor (willie best), lake's auditor, a songwriter who thinks lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him. it's up to newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer.the baby-voiced wheeler and the cigar-chomping woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny.not this one. george stevens, who went on to have a distinguished career, directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot. but two scenes are good, and both feature wheeler and betty grable singing the excellent "music in my heart," written by dorothy fields and jimmy mchugh. the first time, they sing it walking up a staircase (after which they dance back down). later, wheeler and woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to mary, who is in a jail cell on a high floor. wheeler and grable sing to each other through the bars."the nitwits" has a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by woolsey's line: "sonny, you've got the brain of a six-year-old boy. and i'll bet even he was glad to get rid of it." it's watered-down grouchowho didn't use the superfluous "even" when he said it.

well, don't bother. this film looks so tired, the acting is so old-fashioned, and the plot and characters so drab, that it should be studied instead of watched. it is really a horrible waste of film; stereotypes, clichés, nonsense, and amateurish film-making. i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open. how could such a film be made, and more interestingly, how could anyone find it funny or watchable? old, tired, sloppy... a junior-high skit, at best. there is nothing watchable there, except for a study of very ancient film. not good film, just ancient. this is not abbott and costello or laurel and hardy. this is nonsense. the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh. some films are so bad that they are good. but, this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again.

ever have one of those sneezes that seems to build up forever? you gasp and you convulse and you grab the nearest paper product in preparation for the world's greatest hanky-blower...and then it fizzles. "frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze. now, i'm big on b-movies, and i always look the other way when a boom mike pops onscreen or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of gerald ford, but this one really let me down. the cover of the video, for instance, is the tag-line of the whole movie. using parts from murdered new york prostitutes, dr. franken rebuilds his deceased fiancee, only to have her run amok in manhattan as a sort of superprostitute with a bad attitude. after an hour and a half of build-up, this fairly funny ten minutes seemed a little anti-climactic.

this showed up on a dvd a buddy of mine bought for me. they had it listed as "the savage guns" which was an entirely different movie. obviously the folks who packaged the dvd never bothered to look at what they were burning on the disk.anyway, this movie is about as bad as they come. the sound track is a combination tv batman/early james bond/spaghetti western. lots of galloping around to this music. it appears that the guy has to gallop between scenes to burn up some time and give the sound track folks something to do.english is dubbed over the italian and it really shows. i wish it had been just a little bit worse and then it would have had some of the campy feel of the ed wood films. as it is, it is just plain awful.

at it's core, this is a fairly typical revenge western, heavy on the spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist comes through successfully defeating the main villain. however there's so much going on that has no bearing on the story that you have to wonder what the film makers were thinking about. i'm referring to stuff like the way miss rosie's singing number just pops up out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of town. ok, they have a loose connection to the influence villain mash flanagan has, but why all of a sudden does he turn up with an alias - mr. donovan.on the flip side, i thought it was pretty innovative how the camera shot showing the wounded wallach's view of the trail might have been filmed by someone with an actual bullet in his shoulder. and wasn't it great the way donovan's girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little frisky? don't let me forget either the great stunt work by the gravel pit bad guys as wallach guns them down as part of the finale.still, there was one thing unaccounted for, and i kept waiting the entire movie for it. whatever happened to that trio of hoods that flanagan/donovan hires near the start of the picture? you know, the guy martel that a funeral parlor wanted to hire for his gun prowess, the devil's henchman mitchell with the rifle, and the knife thrower lincoln tate. each had a five thousand dollar bounty on his head, and they were supposed to protect donovan from the guy who survived the massacre of the opening scene. they were never heard from again! i like to think that maybe donovan just had them killed and kept the 15k all for himself.

savage guns (video title) is a dirt cheap, bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead, catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss.despite plenty of violence, this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor.lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever. in other words, the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he's the protagonist.the worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy german accent. it was the worst scene in blazing saddles and the worst one here!

i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm. very bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie. the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno, (23 years old), playing a teenage indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's. she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita (1962), only a more innocent lolita. she bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper, almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum, falling all over this old man, willing to give him anything, as he plays it off like she's a hindrance to him. any man in his 50's that had a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride, would be insane not to take advantage of her. it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita moreno's. the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is rita moreno's appearance in the movie.

director lesley selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn "the yellow tomahawk" (1954) pits the cheyenne against the u.s. cavalry with leathery tough rory calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. this united artists western was lensed in color but the tv print that turner classic movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.the action opens with adam reed (rory calhoun of "black spurs") eluding several indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and cheyenne chief, fire knife (lee van cleef of "the good, the bad, and the ugly"), who has killing on his mind. fire knife warns adam that his cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the indians made with the government. on his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, major ives (warner anderson of "objective, burma!"),about the impending indian attack, adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. katherine 'kate' bolden (peggy castle of "i, jury") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of indian country without a care in the world. castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. naturally, major ives dismisses adam's warning from fire knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. this is one of the many questions that the richard alan simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? no sooner have they made this discovery than the indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. sawyer (peter graves of "stalag 17") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. while adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. later, we learn that sawyer and his partner had struck gold. the question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. adam and fire knife have one final pow-wow and fire knife demands that adam hand over major ives or everybody will die. naturally, adam refuses and the indians begin to whittle down the whites. james best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. noah beery, jr., plays a aimable mexican scout pursued by a sexy indian damsel appropriately named honey bear (oscar-winning actress rita moreno of "west side story") and robert bray of "lassie" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that kate had planned to marry. the biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in kanab, utah, is that the evil cavalry officer ives, who slaughtered indian men, women, and children at the infamous sand creek massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a native american, too! ironically, the taut bow that fire knife gives out of friendship to adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. "the yellow tomahawk" concludes on an ambiguous note. the survivors reach another outpost, fort ellis, where adam and ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. producer howard w. koch is no relation to "casablanca" scenarist howard koch. ultimately, "the yellow tomahawk" is one of many pro-indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of "broken arrow" (1950) where the native american is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. peter graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. actually, lesley selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called "war paint" (1953) with robert stack. incidentally, noah beery jr. and rita moreno both went on to become regulars on "the rockford files".

yep, edward g. gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world. first he's an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, albeit briefly by deforrest kelly), then he's so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle. throw in a jaded romance, a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends, and next thing you know -- shazam! black leg lawyer (god i love that phrase). he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair. yawn.but really, the courtroom action is pure melodrama. see him punch out a witness, see him drink poison, see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast. be prepared for melodrama.the hoot of the film though, is jayne russell. with curves defying the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero, she is something to see. even sings a bit.

looking for a movie for your turkey film festival? the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of all-time. the plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic roller blading samurai warrior, is a convoluted hodge-podge of film references of everything from star wars to the seven samauri. the acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal. the scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter. frank stalone's black knight reminds one too much of john cleese's black knight in monty python and the holy grail. (word of advice, frank: when you stoop to doing a movie like this one, your career is over.) i chanced upon this little stink-bomb on a low-end cable channel and i could not stop watching. it is like watching a train wreck, you just can't look away.

this film is, far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt, the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe.it really *is* that bad.personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film, and rented this one thinking it would be one of those. to my immense disappointment, it was not.the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off placards, the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera. i couldn't even finish watching it. it is even worse than "witch academy", and that's quite a feat in itself.i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film, and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release.painful, awful, horrendous.

my house mate and i foolishly purchased the video of 'the roller blade seven' from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at. this film isn't even laughable, it's pathetically poor, worse even than jack frost 2-and that's saying something. the script, acting, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. in some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them. set in the post apocalyptic 'wheel zone',the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film, many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer. this gets tedious very quickly. the plot makes no sense whatsoever (it is apparently an amalgam of two books written by scott shaw), there aren't even seven of them, most of them aren't on blades, they're wearing roller boots, and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi-nudity in it. the writer and star scott shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look massively amateurish. despite all this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making. my house mate and i were left speechless by the whole ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, she has decided it may be some kind of ring-esquire video curse that needs to be passed on. if you see the video in stores, take it from me! leave well alone!

a post-apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass. this is one of the hardest to watch films ever, there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written, badly acted line. there are action sequences that keep repeating - and we're not talking the quickfire 1-2-3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors, we're talking many, many repeats of long, bad fight sequences. this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity, the only thing thats keeps this film in the videoplayer (apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no-one else) is the fact that although painful, this film is unintentionally hilarious, i'm not at all a fan of those "so bad that it's funny" type of films but at parts i was in tears. other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film. final verdict - king of the "so bad they're funny" genre, anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy. also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i've ever seen.

i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a 'b-grade video night' at a friends place. despite the warnings, i was still surprised at just how bad this film was. it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other... the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future, one in which hawk (a mad max type of character) heads off to rescue a damsel in distress. in reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh). the movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. what's even worse though is the editing of this film. the film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. i think that this was an attempt to emulate things like jean claude van-damme fight sequences, but if it is it fails utterly. the film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). i give this movie my 'worst film i've ever seen' award. i doubt that it will be topped any time soon.

this movie is so daring it doesn't attempt to hide its similarities to the shining. it lacks the originality to do so. and when it does, near the end, try to cover up its story of "father goes psycho under influence of sketchy haunted house in a foreign place," it does so by stooping to plenty of other already established conventions and ideas. in other words, it reduces itself to mere cliche. but hell, even i enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller as long as there is an interesting story, one filled with violence and gore, somewhere before the film makes the dreadful turn towards the predictable and trite. well, this film doesn't have a good story and i was really disappointed with it. what 'darkness' has going for it is remarkable direction and cinematography. it is a film well-shot and carefully constructed full of fun, creepy angles and shots. what 'darkness' doesn't have going for it is pretty much everything else. to begin with a minor quibble - the editing in this movie is obnoxious. it jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes pointlessly. for example, the old man in the movie (who pretty much carries the background story, later filled in by another character) is underscored by a hamster running circles. i mean, it looks cool the first time, but why continue to use the same image? i guess you'd have to see it for yourself, to understand what i mean. another problem with this movie is anna paquin's character who essentially whines throughout the film, crying and caring all too much about everything - she's the film's failed attempt at a character-driven horror film. the movie has scenes of overblown sentimentalism and the family drama it depicts is simply not believable. by the end, 'darkness' is a muddled melodrama, with a non-involving mystery provided with too simple of an ending. and it's hardly scary.

an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house. regina (anna paquin), the teenager daughter of mark (iain glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and the nurse maria (lena olin), notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul (stephan enquist), but her mother does not believe on her. reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos (fele martínez) the origins of the house, and they find that forty years ago, the place was the stage of the death of six children. reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert (giancarlo giannini) to protect her brother against the house and her father.i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna paquin, lena olin, fele martínez (from "thesis" and "abre los ojos") and giancarlo giannini. further, i like very much spanish cinema. in spite of, i found a terrible screenplay, an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses. the intention of the story is good, slightly recalling "the shinning" in some moments, but unfortunately it is badly developed, never being clear, for example, the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family, mainly the situation between maria and reggie. the direction is confused, poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story. i love anna paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this flick. lena olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and stephan enquist is too much weak for such important role. only fele martínez has a good performance in his support character. i liked the open end of the story. my vote is four.title (brazil): "a sétima vítima" ("the seventh victim")

when you get ahead of a film, you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. that is exactly how i felt while i was watching "darkness." i could see anticipate every twist and turn easily. it is a combination of "the amityville horror" and a myriad of films that deal with the occult. it is so silly that i almost found endearing its naiveness. i cannot say i was wholly bored but i found the film way too derivative for my taste. director balagueró tries to redo his early spanish hit "the nameless," but he cannot pull it off. i admit, a few sequences were creepy enough but i just abhor when i can figure out what is going to happen next. also, i hated to see good actors like lena olin and giancarlo giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck. finally, anna paquin as the star of a horror film? this must be a joke. she is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor. you can live without watching this one.

if you saw the grudge, a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just worse, a lot worse. this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people. it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot. oh and a place with swings, cause there's a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh how spooky.this one is terrible in every way imaginable. the acting by the lameinator mom and dad don't help matters at all. anna paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film.there is one good moment in the movie, however, when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out "you idiot, you have not understood anything!" lol. well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.

horrendously acted and completely laughable haunted-house horror flick that has an out of place anna paquin playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the "things-that-go-bump-in-the-dark" that are plaguing her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain(?!). little more than a geographically re-planted rip-off of "the shining" and most notably "the others", the weak-plotted "darkness" is basically your typical run-of-the mill b-horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off (so to speak)! in retrospect i suppose i shouldn't have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the well-known fact that it was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticket-sales and very harsh reviews from critics. when will filmmakers ever learn that there's more to making movies (be it horror or otherwise) than just the fey possibility of a little financial gain? (turkey-zero stars)

this review contains spoilers. i didn't have any expectations about this movie. i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie, "white noise".first, the credits for this stupid movie run about 5 minutes into it. the pacing from start to finish is slooooow. the main heroines don't like to wear a bra and the director appears to enjoy the jiggle effect as anna paquin descends the stairs. if you like movies for boobies, this one has a low level buzz factor.second, it's nice that the movie rips off elements of lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in better movies, there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior. this stinker tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they've uncovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and otherworldly rituals are nicely spelled out in a comprehensive book on otherworldly rituals like on buffy. i was waiting for miles to show up and give some consultation on how to slay a certain demon type of so and so.the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you. ho hum. to do this you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them. this opens the world to the age of darkness. at least that's what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. which raises the annoying question of, uh, well, how did the ones who wrote the book know, and, if this is what happens, would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library, much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness, an age brought on by lunatics who could have performed this like much earlier using the "occult practices to bring the world to darkness for dummies, 2nd edition"? it turns out the father in the story is the 7th child, the one that ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is the doctor/grandfather in the movie, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably, other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if dumb sh*t like this opening the world to darkness actually works. the grandpa let the father go because he "didn't really love him". aduh. stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he's some kind of eurofilm auteur. there's also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big welts on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction. the whole movie is like this. people seeing really weird sh*t going on and not reacting to it in any sort of normal way. must be bad plot and direction.anna paquin does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a smirk, and she does look smashing in a halter top, but at several critical moments in the story, her character doesn't bother to call in for back up. you know, more of the same, "i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower even though i sense impending doom." and even dumber as it may seem, even if you bring on the age of darkness, these creatures who make you bloody can't attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know, and tell you to turn off the light source. reminds me of the video game "alone in the dark"; maybe this movie is a rip off of that game's concept.the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna. they both die at the end. the entire family dies. the darkness creatures lead them to their death, but really, the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. the other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors from the red shoes diaries series of fine cinema.so to wrap up, the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in bumping around blindly in an obviously abnormal situation, the really crap plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn't tell anyone because, well, no real reason, they couldn't find the kids, but he didn't bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a 40 year period because he worries about what is going on inside...derrrrh...duuuuh), the hackneyed use of scare mechanisms (more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs, and blood on the wallpaper), and the egotism of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition, makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies.is it entertaining? at 2x speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on, it can be entertaining, until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap, otherwise it draaaaaaaags on. the cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake; the empty calories are horrid.the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen "the ring" and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood, which in this respect, the film fails miserably, and so, also, in this respect, jaume balagueró, it is my opinion that you suck at what you do.

what starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent, unscary, incompetently made, stupid attempted horror films of recent years.absolutely terrible. it's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare. whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of fulci's gates of hell.the worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump. to be avoided.

you know, i was very surprised when watching this movie. it aired during the day once when i was sick, and having nothing else to do, i continued watching. this is by far the worst movie ever! but to my surprise i kept watching. i sat there saying, this is terrible, but yet didn't change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was. maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had, that kept me watching. however, the girls weren't half bad, but if that's what you want, there is far better. oh, and there's "ninjas" and "pajama boys!"so if you like ninja's, bad acting, hilarious(and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. it's so bad it's good. however, i just had to give it a 1 out of ten. i couldn't have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the rings.enjoy!!!!!!!!! :)

this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film. my uncle's home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap.the plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island. the man has a very cheap paper maché looking hand.the acting is atrocious in this movie. there are scene changes at the drop of the hat. for instance, for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie. this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life, i don't think this movie could get any worse then it already is. i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong. and i hate chuck norris.

why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck. i just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. its pretty telling that the cast imdb "credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again.bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. it just goes on and on. the movie really has nothing to recommend it. if you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won't require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards.i hope this film didn't get money from the government for financing, otherwise i'm never paying taxes again.

i...i don't know where to begin. dragon hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history. even anus magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. showgirls? no, it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film. but dragon hunt takes the cake, and eats it, then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man. it's that much of a travesty.the acting, if it can even be called that, is rough. it doesn't have the charm of improvised acting, so it must be scripted, but it's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically, those people on screen) either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from saturday night live, which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera. i could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film, but you and i both don't want to hear it.the make-up and special effects (which, with most films, is the only good thing) was laughably bad. the antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous i can't remember it, has a mohawk glued to the top of his head. yeah, glued to his head. and you can tell it's glued on too, if you look at the spot where it meets his pockmarked skull you can see a plastic strip, not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes. thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make-up no-nos in the film.there's also some terrible character development, to put it lightly. the women, who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers (and i mean, they are really pushed around), are not only ugly but...gasp...they don't know what they're doing! in one scene they turn on their apparent lovers, join up with the even uglier bad guy, and then snort some coke. apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing even before all of it went up their nostrils. great timing girls! plus they wear some truly horrible stuff, clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s.overall this movie, this film, this waste of film i should say, is also a waste of time. watching it will hurt you, and will require the suspension of not only your belief, but also of your entire brain. if you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs, see if you can get this film (you'll probably have to download it) otherwise, don't even think about it. hope i was helpful.

this canadian "movie" is the worst ever! stunningly amateurish. when the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, with a very low voice, "we're robbing your ship!" she blinks and is totally shy! very intimidating. rotflol!!!the two karate chopping heroes are 40something year old, five feet tall twin brothers! they're really bad actors. in fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor.there are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing. in one scene, the guys are wearing one type of swimsuit. in the following shot, they're wearing completely different swimsuits. absolutely terrible! a must see for any fan of bad movies. i have it on vhs. it's very rare. i cherish it.

everything about this movie is bad. everything. ridiculous 80's haircuts. ridiculous moustaches. ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that the adversaries do not even hit each other. bad, bad, bad 80's music. repeated scenes of people running through woods. a bad guy with a silver plastic hand and silly hair. stupid dialogue. the acting is nonexistant. everything looks extremely cheap. this movie even surpasses "plan 9 from outer space" in its utter badness.it's not "funny bad" it's just bad.

i thought this was an extremely bad movie. the whole time i was watching this movie i couldn't help but think over and over how bad it is, and how that was $3.69 down the drain. the plot was so jumpy. they did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school, but they never really explained anything after that. was it a supernatural thriller? was it a regular thriller? apparently you can decide for yourself, because they didn't see the need to explain. i understood basically what happened, i think. what i got confused about was all of it prior, what was the deal with the bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? was this guy coming back? was the wife channeling "carrie" or something? who knows? you certainly won't after watching this movie.

...but i would be lying. a relative was a crew member, and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days (and i was an extra). i get to die and have a second of screen time, not that i plan on moving to hollywood anytime soon. i just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it. plus, i got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. they didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent. why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me, but the main character "cherry" is the director's sister so that could be part of it. but the cinematography was good. :)

i don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves. this movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred, and not in the good "artsy " way of offending. this film becomes the archetype for painful dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.

saw the film at it's lawrence, kansas premiere. this wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. it fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. but mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - "hey i have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking it out. sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. they just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. with this film i do not feel ashamed to say, that if i didn't know some of the crew, i would have walked out. simple as that.

this is a really really bad movie. that may seem like an oversimplification. a fickle, childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult. the truth is, there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot, the really atrocious acting (i'm talking nasty here folks), or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film-making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema, nay, human culture. please, take my word for it, don't watch it... ever. i'm serious. stop. you'll thank me for it later.

with pep squad receiving an average of 4.7 on imdb.com, no wonder steve balderson slanders this website so. but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for a reason). it's a movie full of over-acting (cherry, beth's mother), coupled with a couple of lethargic performances (beth and julie's boyfriend). a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed. a movie chock full of not-so-appetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder, "does the director think this is funny? or clever?" most of all, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. pep squad can't decide whether to be a comedy, or a drama, or a satire (patriotic music, i get it...). the movie fails at being serious, because the idea of killing for any school position (this being prom queen) crosses the line into insanity (not to mention shots of flag burning and drive-by shootings, a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy), and fails at being a comedy, for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes (big butt mama, "funky" black principal, and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast). watching the documentary "wamego: making movies anywhere" only made this film more cringe-worthy, with praise lauded towards it by... the director and the director's father... hmmmmmm. not a black comedy, or anything for that matter. i guess kansas will have to wait.

in my opinion, the movie was laughable--bad dialogue. whoever wrote the script--please keep your day job. it's definitely no godfather or goodfellas. it's good to be on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words. some of the characters were clowns. but what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors.

wow, what a racist, profane piece of celluloid garbage, and what an insult to the great genre of westerns.exploitive? sex scenes abound, profanity abounds, violence and gore abounds.....everything that gives modern movies such a good name, especially among those who prefer classic-era movies. this is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against today's films. somehow i just can't picture nude male bathing scenes in randolph scott or gene autrey films. nor can i picture hearing "motherf---er!" exclaimed here and there. i sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago. yet, the f-word is so prevalent here you'd think you were watching a story centered in today's urban areas, not the old west of the 1800s.prejudice? well, what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty, brutal villain? do you think someone might complain about a racist movie? home come we don't hear an outcry when the reverse - as demonstrated in this film - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country?mario van peeples wrote, directed and starred in this bomb. remember that name. apparently, he is the "ed wood" of today's filmmakers. even spike lee wouldn't be this racist. you can't get much worse than this movie.

this is the worst movie of all time! it's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1/3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet. if you actually watch the whole thing, god help you.

this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films i've ever seen. it's basically a remake of the beast from 20,000 fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet-monster instead of a sleek ray harryhausen creation. combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the creeping terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like.the movie is dubbed, although by the original actors (i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences, then redubbed for us release), which just makes the movie seem weird...the sounds, like in a japanese monster movie, just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly.poor ray milland...he's certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or dial m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in. add this to his other sci-fi travesties (panic in the year zero, x the man with x-ray eyes) and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndrome...stuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. a movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth.spoilers if you even carethey can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie. the movie ends and they're like, "well, some day we'll have to kill it."avoid at all costs.

and abysmal, over-the-top acting, you might enjoy this rubbish flick.apparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two (or according to other viewers, wake them up). or so it seems. and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesn't make anyone ask any questions at all. coming to think of it, the plot doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever (why would evil sock puppets attack lighthouses?), so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesn't stand out too much.ok, getting past this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten, you may actually be able to stand this. but for once the complete lack of gore doesn't help, leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock-bottom-budget "glory".i doubt you'll be able to watch this though, so better stay well away.

this film has me seriously doubting again whether armando de ossorio was a good filmmaker or not... his blind dead films are praised by many fans. this i can understand. but wanna-be gothic vampire trite like malenka doesn't show any signs from a gifted filmmaker. and that also goes for serpiente de mar. it features horrible acting, a dumb plot, stupid events, a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster-movie and also veteran actor ray milland, who does his best to mumble his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what he's doing in it. apparently milland was already very ill while shooting serpiente de mar (his last theatrical feature) and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this, makes it all the more sad. one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a made-for-tv film directed by roy ward baker (also in 1984) doesn't change much about it.but the sock puppet/sea serpent is a hoot to behold. watch it swirl up a lighthouse and crush it. see it destroy a harbour with miniature boats. look at it demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trains.good badness? yes. 3/10 and 7/10

amando deossorio was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. his "blind dead" series started off great but had some truly laughable moments, such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for "the ghost galleon". in "the sea serpent", he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums.a vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where american pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of spain. the military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent american flag and a portrait of a deranged-looking ronald reagan, one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the eighties. the other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be "1.985" and tyria power's dated sheena easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.one of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. we learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the sea serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of spain for some miniature-set mayhem.now when i say the monster is unrealistic, i am not exaggerating. it's not just "sort of" fake looking. i'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted, but most of the time it looks like it was made out of crayola markers, a ping pong ball, and an old sock. not only that, it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that sounds so much like the "jaws" theme that it's a wonder nobody got sued.along with tyria power, timothy bottoms and ray milland are caught slumming, and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal. through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, i'm not sure what the purpose is. bottoms and power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). none of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. furthermore, power and bottoms are still on the lam from the law. as illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. the critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. but never mind. it swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. the end.i can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on. a lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced-in sock puppet/stop motion beastie. at least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head. i'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so somebody did spend some time making those, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved. it's seemingly played straight, although maybe this film's sense of humor went over my head. in the end, the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary. watch it at a party for best results.

i absolutely positively can't believe my fellow imdb reviewers. all the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "ring" or the million of imitations that's come out in the 10 years since that movie. and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! i think not! "shutter" is okay. average, i'd say. i give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way it's original and great and "the most frightening thing i've ever seen" as one reviewer said. puh-leeeze, people. this one is plain. it's predictable.i swear, if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them, i'm going to scream."original"? give me a break. you people need to get out more. or at least stop calling yourselves "horror movie fans".

one of my co-workers recommended this one, implying that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched. i checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or so.yesterday, i had a long talk with my co-worker (we're still friends!).this movie is as original as the latest film starring steven seagal. it brings absolutely nothing original to the table. the spooky parts have been done thousand of times before.the biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie. the periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of.. nothing..1 of 10 molotov cocktails

i have seen many japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same. this one is no exception. the ghost is a black haired girl, that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead.. the difference is just the motive for the haunting. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), creepy acting. while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before. some scenes where quite nice though, i'll give it 3 out of 10

i don't know, but the movie was just too similar to other movies i've seen. the ring, the eye, dark water, they're all the same to me. don't get me wrong, it's beautifully made, lovely camera work, great graphics, but that story is just too.. too common. in the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: the screams, rumbles. the characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by anything they see. i know some people that love this kind of film, and if you do, being a well made movie, i guess it doesn't hurt to watch it. but if you've seen the movie i've mentioned above and didn't like them, then i'd suggest you don't bother.

i should explain that as far as this trend goes for ripping off asian horror movies, this shutter is a head above the grudge, and dark water, while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that the ring establishes.still though movies, like life, don't exist in a vacuum and are therefore up for comparison to other suspense/thriller/horror movies. honestly, i'm not writing a lengthy synopsis here and will say that this movie attempts to rely on music induced "startle" scares rather than atmosphere and the "ghost" itself really isn't that remarkable. the plot is pretty basic and predictable and isn't anything to write home about either. while there are a few suspenseful scenes that border on creatively scary, most of the movie is pretty vanilla. if you enjoyed the grudge and it's ilk then you might enjoy this.grade: c-

it's not just that the movie is lame. it's more than that. this movie is just unnecessary. do we need another western? how about a western with afro-americans in the titles roles? sound stupid, implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre? it is. incredibly lame and simple minded. it's like that lame baz luhrman film "romeo and juliet" where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale. well, baz luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-american cast is racist in itself. it's also puerile and simple minded (like baz luhrman-man he's a bad director). hey (i hear you say) this was directed by mario van peebles! he's also in the film! how can it be racist? it's not. i said the idea of casting all afro-americans instead of caucasians was. the film isn't racist, it's just pointless, stupid and very very boring.

i decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the "scariest movie ever" so, that's what i expected. unfortunately, what i found out is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment in it (and i'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). the movie was nothing but terrible clichés and every time there was a jump-moment it was incredibly obvious. the pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well (like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see tun in the reflection and when it swings back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders). overall, this movie really added nothing new to the j-horror genre and all-around lacked creativity and scares.

i'm normally a fan of mel gibson, but in this case he did a movie with a poor script. the acting for the most part really wasn't that bad, but the story was just pointless with flaws and boring. i thought i would like the movie a little but i didn't like it at all actually. i give it a 1 1/2 out of 5!

that this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that god is truly dead. am i the only one that really saw (rather sleptwalked) through this "film"? this is the only movie i've ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back -- it was just that dull. and i even saw "highlander 2: the quickening" at the local cinema. from beginning to end, gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies, cast together by circumstance, who eventually work together as best buddies. the action (what little there is) is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer. thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our "cinema" that there's no chance for an "air america 2."

roger spottiswoode isn't the worst director, and he did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "the sixth day" (a.k.a. "the box office downfall of mr. schwarzenegger"). however, "air america" has to be one of his most inept projects.it comes across as an amalgamation between drama, comedy and war film - it's not a very convincing mix. in fact, i found it to be overbearing.robert downey, jr. (during his heyday) stars as a pilot recruited into a top secret cia organization operating during laos in the vietnam era. mel gibson plays his co-pilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they're trafficking drugs, and what not.the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and aerosmith had re-recorded the doors classic "love me two times" for the soundtrack.the redo of the song is pretty poor, which suits the film.

skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location. they get drunk every night. they smuggle opium. they drop pigs in parachutes. they fly under impossibly hazardous conditions. they dress weird and act weirder. they're iconoclastic, outrageous. they violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the cia. they're irreplaceable.nope. it's not "only angels have wings" and it's not "m*a*s*h." it's an uneasy mixture of the two that unfortunately comes across as more silly than funny.it aims at shock, amusement, and education, but doesn't really achieve its goals.as far as its shock value is concerned, well, we're inured by now, aren't we? does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard-living pilots flew secret missions in laos in the 1970s? no, it's not shocking. it's not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursion was not buried in a file labeled national interest, defense de toucher. that's okay. so we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so shockable nor so dumb.the problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse. without that, the film implodes. a group of shaggy drunken cia pilots are sitting around in a cat house, goosing the girls, shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol, killing lizards with same. asks newbie pilot robert downey, jr., "when you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate?" replies another, guffawing, "no, it means it's night time." that might be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. if we don't, the gag, like the movie, falls flat.there are action scenes naturally. everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight. people fall out of them, baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches, engines fail, they sustain damage from aaa, the are torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better.some might find this funnier than i did, and the acting is pretty good. robert downey jr. is especially effective as the straight man. check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing, then by all means watch it. there might be some laughs in it that escaped me.

prior to airport 79' these movies were rather good. they had decent special effects, all-star cast, and good acting. this movie destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for it. lets talk about the special effects wow!!!! they are horrific, what was the director thinking about. i know it's only 1979, but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars(1977),and moonraker(1979). i like the idea of the concord and this could of been the best airport movie, but they did too much with it. how about joe patroni(george kennedey) shooting a flare out of the cockpit window, to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the concord. also he is doing 90 degree dives and loops. this completely far fetched, and unrealistic wow!!!!!! believe me the special effects don't help this scene, and really are beyond poor.... they almost look like a cartoon, and this is how the whole movie is!!!finally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best.... over acting is a major issue in this movie, especially george kennedy.. which i really like as an actor, but just doesn't cut in this movie. the full blame has to go on the director, who did a very poor editing job, and really whacked out the airport franchise. too bad the concord isn't still used today it was a marvel of air travel...

this final installment of the "airport" franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy, like "airplane". george kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed? you'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. the passengers were unintentionally hilarious, as was the interior of the plane. the sophisticated french woman coming on to slobby george kennedy was like jackie kennedy coming on to ernest borgnine. ain't gonna happen. susan blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, did not get any points on her resume for this one. neither did robert wagner. this movie was so lousy it seemed surreal.

i just saw this movie on tnt and let me tell you, this movie was downright corny and cheezy. but after a certain point, i began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth, they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action/adventure. the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the delon and kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the french missiles that wagner ordered to destroy the concorde. our fearless leader, kennedy, decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles????? dumb yet funny---the kicker comes here though---after one shot, the flare gun malfunctions and kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well...if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie. the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot----yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don"t even see it???? its right in front of their eyes!!!!-----final rating for this move--- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy

its a truly awful movie with a laughable storyline.some awful acting.and a script that ed wood might be ashamed of.wagner is laughable in this. he plays his role like number two in austin powers.easily the worst of the airport movies.1 out of 10

'airport 4' is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist - the concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky' formula.bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft's flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. many stars in this one including robert wagner, sylvia kristel, alain delon, and martha raye as a nervous passenger. not really related to the other 'airport' films.

the concorde ... airport '79 starts in washington where a man named carl parker (macon (mccalman) contacts high profile tv news reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely) in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss kevin harriosn (robert wagner) owner & president of harrison industries that develop weapons for the military has been illegally selling said weapons to foreign countries. however maggie sees carl assassinated & she barely escapes with her life, maggie is to catch the concorde to moscow via paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him. determined to save himself he reprogrammes his hi-tech 'buzzard' homing missile to intercept & destroy the concorde during a test run killing all those on-board & destroying the documented evidence...renamed airport '80 - the concorde for it's cinema & initial home video releases because it was released here in, well, 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the airport franchise was directed by david lowell rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press & test screenings prompting universal to promote the film as an action comedy. the first thing to say is that the concorde ... airport '79 is a really silly & downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis i can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching, i really can. i quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend tv reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle & decides the best way to do it is to blow concorde up with his own guided missile & then gets a fench fighter pilot to try & shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot joe patroni manages to save the day. you know joe patroni played by george kennedy appears in all four airport films & goes from mechanic in the first to concorde pilot extrodinaire in this, also i reckon he's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters. i think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was because patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted. some of the things that happen here are just silly, patroni does barrel rolls, flies upside-down & out manoeuvre's a guided missile in a huge concorde not to mention he crash lands it & fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head. this guy is good, very good. then there's the character's, there's a saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem & a team of russian gymnasts with bad accents. also, despite being almost shot down with a missile & then attacked by a jet fighter the passengers of concorde don't seem that bothered & happily get back aboard the following day, i don't know about you but after that i would probably find a safer way to travel & why do the police or authorities not question anyone? why is the concorde captain patroni allowed to just go off & sleep with a french prostitute? the concorde ... airport '79 certainly isn't boring & is full of memorable moments & i was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film & modern audiences may not have the patience with it, hell i liked it for what it was in a daft way but it's no sort of classic.even though concorde no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air-plane & there's plenty of footage of it here, the one used in the concorde ... airport '79 was the seventh one built. this concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on july 25th 2000, while taking off in paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. when this aired on tv in the us in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished. i know the effects here take a bashing from most but i don't reckon they are too bad, when you consider this was made in the late 70's i think they come across quite well. the camera moves during effects shots, real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse & i could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds & limited technology. in a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what i mean. probably the most action packed of all the airport films there's missiles, exploding planes, daring crash landings, assassinations & a guy named robert palmer (no, not the singer) giving head a woman in a jacuzzi.the imdb says this had a budget of about $14,000,000 which is actually more than i thought, maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all. shot in utah, washington, los angeles & france. the acting isn't great here, people don't look worried enough that they are about to die. goerge kennedy gets some bad one-liners while robert wagner plays the bad guy.the concorde ... airport '79 is fun for bad film enthusiasts everywhere & to be brutally honest i rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour oscar nominated bore.

there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh. alongside chaplin,stan and ollie,the marx bros and.....(fill in your own special favourites)space must be made for everybody connected with "airport 80 - concorde,the movie". robert wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime.i would never have thought he had it in him. the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie. british moviegoers will recognise the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian athlete,a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but,tragically,he couldn't.i have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny. george kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time,and my goodness he triumphs!brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue,each word lovingly polished into coward-like brilliance. only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like "airport 80".all the years of toil and struggle,the sweat,the tears,the lessons with lee strasberg,living out of suitcases,born in a trunk etc etc,all come to fruition.a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on. i think i'm ready for my medication now.

this film is an absolute disgrace! i thoroughly enjoyed the original airport, and i can't believe how the same people could produce this twaddle nine years on. first of all, the acting is bad. the original had actors who had done quality (non-disaster) films before, but this one uses actors who have done the disaster movie circuit already (blakely, kennedy, wagner). also, george kennedy's character patroni seems to get promoted very quickly. he is now the lead in the film, but his character isn't strong enough to carry it off: he has lost the charm and humour of airport (1970), and the character is now just boring. have i mentioned the plot? is it at all believable that someone would send a missile after the concorde?? no!!! there are also too many loose ends; scenes that have no relevance whatsoever to the plot. the scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the chase of the thief in charles de gaulle airport are two such scenes. both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the actual story. there also many unanswered questions: why does patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane? why does robert wagner's character kill himself? (he must have another stupid and costly way of why is there no enquiry after the missile almost blows up the concorde? why are the back projections so bad? (it looks as though a cartoon missile is following the concorde; although it does work well when the plane lands in paris) why does patroni think that he is in a flight simulator? (when he turns the concorde over) why does he get a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after having terrified the passengers? and why is the ending so poor, if it can be called an ending at all? given their one-dimensional-ness, no-one seems to notice this. the blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coach is shmaltzy, the man who plays the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just plain silly. the scenes where susan blakely is lying on the roof of her conservatory, and the when she tells wagner that she still loves him are quite awful. in conclusion, this film should have been the climax of the previous three airport films: instead it is a diabolical, sub-moronic, complete and utter waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent"!!!!!!! remember when patroni asks the french pilot if he has "ever landed on his belly?" this film certainly does the belly flop, and lands flat on its pointy nose...

warning **spoilers**lord knows i have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry. this is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. the "story" involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (badly acted by otherwise great robert wagner) is a murder, thief, and just an overall puke face. after the concorde takes off, he sends guided missiles to destroy the concorde. so while the concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, george kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit then, sticks his hand out the window to fire at the missile! i'm no rocket scientist, but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn. then towards the final "climax" when the concorde is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fiance and proposes marriage. a priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing! (i'm not making this up) wow, the guy who wrote the script must have been sniffing glue for a week.

i gave "airport '79" only two stars because it's a truly lousy film. nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for charo's chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) this is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. it helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.a'79 really does seem like an early version of "airplane!" every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. you're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? the hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? no problem. you can still catch that early-morning flight to paris...no need to get the cops involved. your plane dodges one unmanned "drone" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? no problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. it's truly funny.and i'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. jimmie basically says, "nope." later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. this aspect of the film is just fun. (one passenger actually obeys the attendant. when charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) in summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing. unfortunately, the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this, as it was probably entirely unintentional.

my take: the silliest of the airport movies, and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies.as if to milk the franchise with all its got, the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action, silly subplots, gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements. in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet, concorde: airport '79 is the worst one yet, and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's. with its bad box-office results, it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome.the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed-up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000). but then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the "all-star" cast, which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars, tv actors and none-too-popular b actors. the plot is sillier than ever: george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni, now the pilot of the concorde (co piloted by co-pilot alain delon) en route to france after the summer olympics. on board is reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely), who has just discovered that his boyfriend, renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison (robert wagner), is selling their weapons to terrorist. to prevent her from revealing the news to the world, harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing.the cast/subplots are dumber than ever, even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun. we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler (!), martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character doesn't go deeper than that), j.j. walker a a pot-smoking saxophonist (arguably the most annoying character in the film), eddie albert married to "old" wife sybil danning, avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally, a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici (much to the sour watching-eye of coach mercedes mccambidge). plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo (and her pet chihuahua) and bibi anderson. camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick-in-the-balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies. this one is, in more than the sense of the word, a true disaster.rating: *1/2 out of 5.

i saw this short film on the dvd for ridley scott's film, the duellists. there was no introduction by scott before the film, it just started right up. boy and a bicycle is hardly an example of ridley scott's other work, it bears no resemblance. the film shows a boy, played by tony scott, riding around on a bicycle. guess what? that's pretty all that happens. the boy rides around, rambling on and on with pointless, confusing dialogue. the film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by ridley scott, i expected some cool cinematography or visually-striking sets. instead, i was treated with nothing. this film isn't even good for a first effort. however, i recommend that any fan of ridley scott should check it out at least once.

these days, ridley scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm movies--especially since he has films like alien, gladiator and blade runner to his credit. so from this partial list of his credits, it's obvious he's an amazing talent. however, if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school, you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness. that's because although it has some nice camera-work and style, the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving. however, considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground, then i am disposed to looking at it charitably--hence the score of 4.by the way, this film is part of the cinema 16: european shorts dvd. on this dvd are 16 shorts. most aren't great, though because it contains the man without a head, copy shop, rabbit and wasp, it's an amazing dvd for lovers of short films and well worth buying.

this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen, it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a hollywood-so-called-thriller. the protagonist is a loving father & a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: finding out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real.certainly, he get's involved deeper & deeper, smeary pornoshops (run by mexicans) & sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the "snuff" movie. assisted by a "smart" (he read a book) sexshop employee, he's catching up with a murderous bondage-film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film... ...and what do you expect? they are portrayed as the simple evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones, and he's the purifier. boom. killer of the killers. end of film. is it that bad? yes, i'm afraid so.ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who did the killing) is even pointing at his ridiculous character: in the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he's wearing one) and recognizes that "machine" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. then "machine" says: "blablabla i'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, i had a nice childhood, i just love to do what i do!"i just love to kill people. yeah, sure, "everybody loves killing people" (bender). it's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring, it's also it's ugly "i have to kill these people"-attitude which makes you sick. in one scene, our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him...but he can't. so what does he do? he calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead. the mother cries yes, she'd love her child, he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him.to come to the point: this film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob-supporters (certainly the police does not play any role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot. probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot.don't waste your time with this.

there is nothing good to say about this movie. read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other writings. abbie was often dismissed as the clown-prince of the '60's, but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness, his sense of humor and pop culture, and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas. the media too often concentrated on the man, not the ideas, and that's the problem with this movie, too. later in his life he did suffer from depression. but this flick is like a national enquirer version of abbie. he deserves better. if you don't know abbie or his times, this movie won't help. this film lies. i give it a zero. 

want a great recipe for failure? take a crappy, leftist political plot, add in some weak & completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash).the result is 'steal this movie,' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived.this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time. words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. this is not 'plan 9 from outer space.' this is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'steal this movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen. it depresses me when i realize that people *actually* took time out of their lives to act in this tripe, if you can call it "acting." but then again, when you have poor direction, poor writing, poor everything - "acting" is the last thing to criticize.this movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence, fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. thank you, robert greenwald, for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen. you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and/or boring.

the trouble with this film, like so many other films that fail, is the script.the script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place. what is the story here? ok, it's a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes. some selection and editing is required but this script just didn't select or edit enough. it didn't render hoffman's life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and, through them, 'get' the bigger picture of the whole man.the movie wanders from being a straight plodding 'troubled genius' biopic, to semi-docu/mocu-mentary (using new shots faked up to match archive footage), to sub true life sob stories movie of the week (the whole "i'm bringing up a son who doesn't know i'm his dad" shtick), to political conspiracy theory movie etc. etc. it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be, and the half-hearted citizen kane like narrative structure (reporter interviewing people from hoffman's past) is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts out.the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important. the whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after vincent d'onofrio pounds the window screaming "i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman!" ("i'm acting! i'm acting! i'm acting!") could have easily been cut. all that happens is the psychiatrist says "you have bipolar disorder here's some lithium.", and the two women in his life say "we could see you weekends more often." and bang! that's it. no more mental health problems. it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily, and should, have been dumped before it was shot. the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god? pointless. tells us nothing about anything. yet, when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust, the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesn't make any sense to the audience. suddenly he's dealing in heroin? where did this come from? why? what is going on here? i, being a middle-aged leftie, would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of 'the man', 'the pigs', 'the fuzz' etc. as brutal, be-suited, unthinking, hippie-hating androids. it may have been like that in 60's america, i don't know, i wasn't there, but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemic.having said all that vincent d'onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything, even reading a bus timetable, though she just wasn't right for this part.

let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of abbie hoffman and have read steal this book and steal this urine test. also am a even bigger jerry rubin fan. but his movie was a discusting pile of rubbish that made a very pg version of abbie hoffman. the director took no chances into making abbie hoffman interesting in this movie. they despicted stew albert as a f***ing cartoon chjaractor devoid of intellegence, the man was a proffesor at berkley for christsakes. ok they did a horrid casting job for anita hoffman, did a horrible job casting for the jerry rubin character. i just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that i have seen of abbie or the books that he wrote. the movie just didnt fit and upset me. oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over i have ever heard of richard nixon. this is one of the few movies that i have ever rented that i could not sit all the way through because, i have a passion for abbie hoffman and his discruntled band of yippies and this movie was just plain badly done. and it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the yippies they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap.

this film plays like a demented episode of vh1's "where are they now", or "behind the music". in the first half of the movie (that depict his "glory days") abbie hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. you know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who didn't write any of the music, doesn't have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. consequently he takes his success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. indeed hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. in it we see hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for his downfall. eventually the times pass him by completely; and he can never to come to grips with that. how sad. the end. end credits roll and oh no! we learn that abbie hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989.i'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie. given that tom hayden and gerald lefcourt were involved, i'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the 60's and of the left's anti-war movement. in this they have failed miserably. the film presents abbie hoffman as a mindless caricature. we are never told about what drives him. how did he arrive at his views? how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? how did he organize such a vast movement? why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine? why? who knows, and since the filmmakers don't seem to, ultimately who cares?

this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points, it's badly made, has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premise.this film uses the idea that h.p. lovecraft has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. i'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy (only for suspension of disbelieve) but that some of his work is based on reality and that insmouth exist is total nonsense.first of all, lovecraft didn't believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all. another myth used in this film is that lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he wasn't, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources.so we end up with a film about people jelling at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for horror.after seeing the film frankenstein lovecraft said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered. i feel sorry for lovecraft.

so many of these types of movies out these days. this zombie flick falls into the major "cheese" category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead, and day of the dead. in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them. but they were also good movies. a low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around. whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time.this movie had so so special effects and a very un-even plot line. the one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to transform into zombies. in this one, it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie. yet with the ease this "infection" spreads you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for infection, and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood.the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didn't get bit. when everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and were able to come out of it without a problem. our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. i was laughing out load at that point. unarmed, having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch? ok sure....also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military. they should have watched a movie like blackhawk down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations.one soldier was a fat overweight special forces private. lol that was a good one. another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors, even putting his weapon down at one point. these guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie stripes. special forces, lol...then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. the explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie. it made no sense at all.the only thing i liked was the anti bush jokes. the military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and at the end it was the vice president from an "undisclosed location" giving the orders. that was the best part of the movie for me.

a college professor is working on creating zombies and, wouldn't you know it, things go horribly wrong. next thing you know, the whole campus is overrun. thank goodness there's a pair of uber-commandos trained for just such a situation. too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron-commandos, lead by a rapper (he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy, he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin' wit' da homies in da hood). the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene. the male and female moron-commandos share the same locker room, and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties. hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in their underwear. my hat's off to the film makers.so, after much discussion of how well prepared these moron-commandos are for the job (bosnia, afghanistan, iraq), they all get killed off in fairly short order. their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on. a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end. human or zombie? can't tell. flip on the lights? no, moron-commando protocol requires them to walk up to the person, making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand, and well, you know the drill. the demise of sergeant major sticky fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie i've ever seen. luckily (and again, hats off to the filmmakers), the hottest babe among the moron-commandos manages to survive. her and the female uber-commando both wind up in tight t-shirts for the remainder of the movie. now this is how a military operation should be performed! there's a bunch of running around, punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber-commandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating (it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through). this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves, and even though we've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell, they're good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go.a few other funny bits - the paris hilton gag, the "can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters, main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on. another chuckle is provided by mr. fingaz, who can't seem to pronounce the word 'tourniquet' (toe-no-kit?).overall, it's somewhat amusing. could have used some more interesting characters, but for a sci-fi channel original, i was mildly impressed.

ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings. this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door. compared to datd the effects are vastly superior. however the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" consistently verge on the moronic. i feel like trying out uwe boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2. i am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. ok there it is. i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2.

ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! the zombie make up was extremely fake! the acting is very poor! and it doesn't really follow the first one! while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. i would say catch it on tv, don't spend your money on it! its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list. i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! the plot was pointless, i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.

oh man, where to even begin.....dropping your gun to get in hand to hand combat w/ a zombie, while holding a bitten soldier down debating to shoot him b4 he turns, then he turns and bites the person holding him down, turning your back on a "fallen" zombie, continuously shooting the chest and seeing it doesn't work, so they shoot the chest some more, having the idea that a kid slumped at a desk w/ blood coming out of his mouth is still alright, walking along a football field like nothing is wrong then all the sudden noticing the zombie football team doing whatever in the middle of the field like they couldn't have been seen up to that point....i could go one for a few more hours, but you get the point.....childish writing and dialog, bad directing, horrid special effects, truly sad and undeveloped storyline (zombie infested campus, must get the viral host then lose it....twice), the only plus i can find is that this one doesn't include clips of the actual game during the "action scenes"....id say don't waste your money, but id be more upset about the waste of time, i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back

i will keep it to bullet points so here goes: 1. very badly scripted. 2. tries to be like resident evil. 3. zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging lunatics. 4. never saw blood clean up so easily! 5. special effects not as good as the original "day of the living dead". 6. acting not as good as the "bold and the beautiful". 7. it looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week.basicaly med team plus special forces go into a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. all die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with 100s of zombies they survived. however special forces (who were trained at kindergarten school scouts) only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons. also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps. overall load of rubbish.

isn't it strange how crap-movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like: "boy, this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before"? it's pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high  or even remotely positive - expectations, as "house of the dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released. the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael hurst, as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor. and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll, huh? having to acknowledge that a straight-to-video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation? in case anyone still doubts: no, "house of the dead 2: dead aim" isn't a good horror movie at all but, yes: it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you're looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering, sleaze and stupid humor. there's no real connection with the events in the first film (another advantage) and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus. the male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house, inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts, but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor (sid haig!) who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie. this is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but, no worries, as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists & soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote. hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they even named them hyper sapiens, but their constantly increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers. director hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre, like james cameron's "aliens" and  of course - george a. romero's dead-trilogy, particularly "day of the dead". he luckily also didn't made the same mistakes as uwe boll, who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie (why?!?) and *slightly* exaggerated with the use of cgi-techniques. hotd 2 contains heavy images of violence, like chopped up female corpses and detailed amputations, but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking. naturally, there's isn't the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror cliché features here as well. the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesn't try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics. they're walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls, so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths. especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasn't got a clue what all the medical terms mean. just avoid getting bitten, sweetheart.

i am furious! it has been a while since the last zombie movie i've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ol' gory zombie movie. hotd2 was a major disappointment. a reasonable story but awful acting, filming, dialogue, and nauseating clichés and punch lines. i didn't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one...now i am curious about how bad could that one have been! the film is full of mistakes and goofs. who on earth analyses dna using a blood sample!? why are these "special forces" who "have been to hell and back" fight like spoiled 6 year old girls? we see ferocious zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two "heroes", take them down to the ground, then let them go without even a scratch. i could go on and on about this but life is too short and i have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry.

when one of the stars of a movie is named sticky fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. stay away. house 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies overrunning a college campus (man, how that must have saved on money). as usual, the "zombies" are given no direction so speak of, and provided very little makeup or costuming. they look like the zombies in one of those endless italian zombie cheapies from years ago. which is to say, they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from george romero and dan o'bannon zombie flicks. the folks battling the zombies are all nonactors who get to shoot guns and do little else. some who have written here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original. all i have to say is i'm glad the sequel's director did away with the 360-degree pan shots that helped to ruin the first movie. house 2 is still just more of the same, which means a lot of nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. there is one set piece, involving soldiers tussling with a zombie football team, that might at least have been funny. it's not.

i used to work in a video store. i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night.this movie was truly awful, there is no redeeming quality about it, because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it. if the first film wasn't low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit, being housed (mostly) indoors and at night...therefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student. rather than be mortified, the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet (he sped up as he approached her) that there is nothing to worry about...after which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her! if this isn't strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment upon her, bringing her back from the dead....and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so.soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and is, to be honest,the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest...like the swimming scene in the first film...but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting, crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns....why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes....its just a very very bad film

if you haven't seen the first one you have to at least know someone who has and you have to know it was painful to sit through. there just wasn't anything good to say about it at all. so what's different with the second one? why bother making a sequel for a movie that was wretched? this one doesn't take itself too seriously. it knows it was made for tv and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue. there are moments where it tries to get 'serious' or 'intense' but these moments are so corny you have to laugh.thankfully gone are any elements of uwe boll and any hint that this originated from a video game (other than the title of course). don't go into this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends unless they're into camp, lame zombie movies, or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie. take two shots whenever ed quinn's character mentions his dead brother! take one shot whenever a bullet would have been better place in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest! etc etc.

so lame it isn't even funny. a zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and a government squad of secret operatives back up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak. collecting zombie dna damn sure is not easy. once bitten you're one of "them". the entire university has been completely infected by the run amok undead.this sequel does not even redeem the awful original house of the dead(2003). senseless entertainment is accomplished though. a few glimpses of female nakedness added to a gaggle of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy. credited cast members: emmanuelle vaugier, victoria pratt, ed quinn, sid haig and nadine velazquez. the "f" word holds together an unimaginative script.

terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than uwe's horrible first film. it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection. these soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out(or at least aren't very interesting)so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of. the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter. it even has the same munching on guts. it just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory. and, the story's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous. one wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit(for they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapability)while others seem to get bit rather easily. the film sole motivation is to show people getting bit..nothing else. just go watch a romero film for lasting effect.

i can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie. instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clichés.where the two unarmed leads have to get down the college steps into the van he surrounds them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten. he can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads shove their way down the steps.sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind. this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombies.with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better.

how bad can you make a film. a good question which house of the dead 2 succeeds in answering. i could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first house of the dead but amazingly the director has succeeded. the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad, just bad. what with overacting, bad fx and a stupid story. its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to z-movies in general. why could they not learn the lesson from the first house of the dead movie? anyway i guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film. it is but a waste of time. watch "bad taste" or "dawn of the dead" if you want to see some good zombies.

"house of the dead 2: dead aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really don't need to see the first "house of the dead" to get this film. that said, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and it's edited quite nicely, with very effective sound design. however, that said, that's about all that's good here.the story and script are awful . . . there's blatant plot holes everywhere. it's also funny how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces (unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you). also realistic how there's little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military discipline.a 4 out of 10.

this is one of the most awful movies i've had the misfortune of picking up. don't get me wrong, i love a good zombie flick, but this wasn't one of them....might as well (from the opening scenes, at least) been called 'titty zombies from outer space'. it had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game (as far as i could tell.) the best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can get covered with so much blood and remain so nonplussed. i would certainly suggest giving this one and miss and staying with a safer zombie pleaser like '28 days later' or 'dawn of the living dead' (the remake, of course, unless you're into some serious campy action.)

i'm sorry, but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before. but they sure didn't act like they even seen a zombie before. jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs. second, the characters are pretty badly written. the actors did the best they could with what was given, i blame bad writing and bad directing. lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest. they loose the sample twice and the girl jennifer holland doesn't know if she's been bit or not. how stupid is that? as much as it hurts to be bitten, one would think you would know, plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue. dumb, the first movie had it's flaws but it has re-watchablity, unlike this disaster of a movie, which i could barely get through once. i give the house of the dead 2: no guts, all stupidity the crap-o-lantern

when uwe boll, cinema con man extraordinaire, released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. hollywood's per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by sony, a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. released direct to television in america, the sequel does improve on the original in most respects, but in so doing, it becomes bland rather than interesting. the scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. in particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found.the cast, on the other hand, is a real step backward. emmanuelle vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent angelina jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it jürgen prochnow. in fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one sticky fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home. put simply, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. say what you will about boll, but he at least inspired actors like ona grauer to fight against his ineptitude. that said, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. unfortunately, with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously, what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined.much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. how this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess, but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. the we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. we are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china, all in this space of time. filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension.the special effects used in house of the dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. where uwe boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, michael hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow. necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. it all makes for a much more convincing throughput, but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. the photography is also much improved. as dvd crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. the writing is also both an improvement and a setback. throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious being run like hell, are offered. the first couple of times, they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue. after the eighth time, however, they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time.interestingly, house of the dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america. given that tom savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results. in contrast to the much-reviled original, the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. in a further contrast to the original, the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing. sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. however, the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. when aliens, the real dawn of the dead, or the evil dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, or did it so well that we did not really care. house of the dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we end up not caring either.for that reason, and many others, i gave house of the dead 2 a two out of ten. it is too good to be bad, but too bad to be any good. unless you are into sucky films as much as i am, you are best to steer clear of it.

i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend, so when it wasn't as bad as that, i was delightfully surprised.unfortunately, i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well...and i was wrong.apparently i'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad.i don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw, or wonder if i saw the wrong movie.ed quinn as ellis and emmanuelle vaugier as alexandra 'nightingale' morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them. they deserve to be in better movies.the special effects were okay and some of the characters likable/hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch, but for the most part, this movie was just a waste of time.oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it aloud all the way through the movie...did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms? only once did it happen, (zombies wandering in) and i found that a little convenient...soldiers walk into a room, leave the door wide open, pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it (with the hapless "livings" being cornered with no way to escape) and yet only once did zombies follow them in.nitpicky? maybe but honestly...if i was fighting for my life, the last thing i'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me.that is really the only thing *bothered* me throughout the movie, and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original.

i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that. the first one i saw, bloodrayne, was not a complete loss. i liked it more than most people, and actually rated it a 4 out of 10. next up was the first house of the dead movie. now that was horrifically bad. i could stand watching ten minutes of it, and fast-forwarding a bit, and that was it. i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10.but i had access to the sequel, too (which however is not by uwe boll, but, mysteriously, written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one), and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original, i thought i'd give it a chance. and i actually managed to watch all of it. it started out with some funny references and cool lines (like how the president got his orders from the vice-president!), and acting-wise it is light-years better than the first. here we have cool muchachas like the ultra-hot emmanuelle vaugier, whose coolness is in league with carrie-anne moss, claudia black and evangeline lilly. man, i hope some matrix-style movie comes along for her sometime. and the always delectable, super-aerobicized victoria pratt. i love athletic women. and, there was also nadine velazquez (catalina on "my name is earl"), who performed quite well.the story wasn't much, and the action wasn't great, either, and the ending was a disappointment, as they didn't succeed in their mission. oh well, at least the two mains survived. guess that's some small victory, too.good cast, but a pretty bad movie. the actors make it watchable, but there's no real substance there.3 out of 10.

granted, hotd 2 is better than the uwe boll crapfest that was the first one, but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. ok ok, i'm being a little bit harsh with this one, its just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. resident evil was alright, but its sequels are pure rubbish. the first hotd was entertaining crap more than anything else; uwe boll saw to that. and hotd 2 was...better? the entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but... this is it? the script, even though subpar, was better than the first one. but in the script dwells horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés, and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the bollmeister very, very proud. but, it could've been worse right?hotd 2 stars sig haig (yes, sid haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death. as you may guess, it all goes to sh*t. a nearby college campus seems to be the center for the zombie (or hypersapien?) epidemic, and as you may expect, a group of commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. their main goal? no, it ain't blowing sh*t up. instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. between this and that lays bland character interactions, an insufferable amount of clichés (but hey, at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed), and decent looking zombies. the acting is passable. who would've thought that sticky fingaz was a passable actor? not me. emmanuelle vaugier and ed quinn shine somewhat as the leads. and the supporting cast was passable too. it was all passable. the make up effects on the zombies were alright, it could've been worse like in the first hotd: just guys running around in dusty mummy suits. the gore was alright too. cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. the action sequences were stupid as f*ck, but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. overall, this movie will appeal only to zombie enthusiasts, fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending, but i wouldn't count on it. unless uwe decides to do it. a 4.

this movie definitely made me laugh but that doesn't mean it was exactly funny. well, then again, me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it.i doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. all of the characters are overused movie cliché cardboard-box roles that don't even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not delivered. we have the corrupt cop, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the forehead at so close a range as to have blood spat on his face. we have the "worn-out cop on the edge" so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie; we have the old one-day-away-from-retirement-cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside, since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie. about as see-through as a glass house on a sunny day. the big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history (they could've just called him marcellus wallace), but just slightly tougher and more ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know laurence fishburne from actually good movies. then we finally have the highly educated doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given. not using it.the whole siege story is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it. there is the initial probe, then the laying of the siege, then the assault, then the escape attempts. meanwhile a bunch of strained, stressed, freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the quite important advantage of vision. then again, in deep night, with the power cut and with a snow storm raging overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision.but the best part comes right at the end. in the first scenes showing precinct 13, we see it is situated in an outskirt of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. from this point, the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up? some alley ending right in the middle of a forest! a forest! where did that forest come from? who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? how is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively flat?? from here i leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense. go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, i can really recommend it.

supreme sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the u.s. government. she has to kill a known tv reporter, but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter. because she hasn't killed him, she becomes the next target of her employers.the script isn't good although i've seen worse b-movies. a hit-man with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror,... what's next? aliens rescuing the victim??? no, supreme sanction will never win any award because of the script. and the acting isn't any better i'm afraid. a few better known actors (michael madsen and kristy swanson), who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie, together with some other actors who probably don't even know what a camera really looks like don't do any good to the movie either.so why should you watch this movie? well, if you haven't got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10,531st rerun of mc gyver or the a-team, than this might be the movie you want to see. otherwise you better leave it alone. i give it a 3/10.

i bought this rental return for $1.99 at hollywood and overpaid. i didn't expect much, but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least. i quickly noted the very weak storyline, the gross overacting by everyone (no one talks like that except in cartoons), and the seemingly let's-make-it-up-as-we-go-along direction. i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it, and i feel certain that it did not help any careers. as for this movie buff of 35 years, it has now provided a ready answer for the worst-film-you've-ever-seen question.

geesh, i never, ever, ever thought i'd write the above four words. but, actually, she's the highpoint of this little flick.as the movie was packaged when i rented it, it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication, which keeps her stable. it sounded like a cute concept. for years, all we ever saw of spelling was as donna martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull, lifeless tv movies. it sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her tv success and her rich daddy, she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie, i figured she took the part because this must be a low-budget jewel.wrong.instead, spelling's part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. when she's not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly, i could've sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. this would've worked so much better if spelling's storyline had dominated, and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and phil, the least irritating kidnapper.

this was my very first "bollywood" movie and i found it in the same way many other recent viewers did -- through "ghost world". having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of bollywood this week, i understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film. but "something for everyone" doesn't always add up to a cohesive product.the ultra-groovy musical dance number "jaan pehechaan ho" has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965. it's all over the internet now, with many folks scrambling for a good english translation. laxmi chhaya does an amazing job dancing take after take, making it all look fresh, new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted! she rules! on the beach with miss kitty is a light-weight fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot. still, i find myself singing it in hindi a week later. i found a rough translation:if you want to live in this life then listen to what i say leave your sorrows behind and join the party take my advicethose who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know? come to me and i'll explainwhoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and theremy second favorite number in the film is the butler's dream where mehmood is entranced by miss kitty's dancing. the electric tiki-like idols are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number. online, i'd seen it described as what would happen if "liberace threw up"!! way fun.gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole. that's why i gave it a rating of 3. it's actually a real stinker of a film with some fun, kitschy musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot.

produced by international playhouse pictures, it looks as if filmed in a doll house. everybody's a liar, everything is dream-like, toy-like for no good reason. i'm not saying everything in all movies should be totally realistic, but such unbelievable fantasy things and situations in one movie are way too much. how did they get these fine actors -actresses particularly- to this movie? it's nice to see mia again; if we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her, mia does do it well. not funny, not moving, just fake. stephen dorff briefly appears at the end, fitting for a play maybe, less for a movie, but this isn't one to measure things at. terrible.

i recently was in a stage version of this play. and, on the last day of the run, i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv. i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night, and i watched it the next day. i have to say i was very disappointed. the actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script. that is understandable as the resersal process is probably different, but it was upsetting to see. a lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen, but i am not sure if it helped the movie out at all. i gave this 4 stars only because i know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays.

depressing black black comedy about a woman (mia farrow) who flees her house on christmas eve when she discovers her husband (tony goldwyn) has hired a hit man to kill her. she ends up with a husband and wife (scott glenn and mary-louise parker) and then things go wrong. basically farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting very strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations.this was advertised as a feel good movie when i saw it around christmas time at its very short run in an art cinema. i found it sick, unfunny and just depressing. i like black humor but this was way too dark for me. what happens to parker's character especially was horrifying. to make matters worse eileen brennan is thrown in as a nun (!!!) later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto.the only saving grace was farrow's acting--it's much better than this picture deserves. also it was a relief to see the very talented stephen dorff pop up at the end. the ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn't erase what had gone on before.sick, morbid, pitch black "comedy". a 1

there isn't much about "reckless" that feels right, beginning with the off-putting title (thanks to screenwriter craig lucas, who adapted his own play, bringing the title along with him) and continuing with the casting (mia farrow playing wife to tony goldwyn, who's young enough to be her son). the couple live in an idyllic winter world that appears to be the inside of a snow-globe, but farrow gets a startling dose of reality after he admits he's hired a man to kill her. she flees into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who want to help her rebuild her life. the production design and art direction of "reckless" are fine, but they are services rendered for a completely inane, often alienating screenplay. it's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy, though the cast is at a loss with this unfunny, occasionally offensive material. *1/2 from ****

oh my god, i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie, seeing as 1903 was one of my fave years for movies ever, but it sucked! the "plot", although i'd hesitate to call it that, is about some dumb elephant. it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death. lame. even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. edison is, like, the worst director ever. plus, the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever. and the ending? wow, that wasn't predictable at all. *sarcasm*the picture quality is horrible too. you can barely tell what's going on most of the time. the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other un-scary horror flicks this didn't spawn eleven sequels. other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you'll never get back.

thomas edison had no other reason to make this film except to show that film can capture the electrocution of an innocent elephant. edison was not a genius but a man out for money and profit; his love for life was measured by dollars, not experiences, as this film shows.

thomas edison may have done lots of great inventions but wtf is this!!!! i am sorry but this movie is simply awful. the plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point & gets electrocuted. okay the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper. i thought that the early charlie chaplin films were awful. okay thomas edison may have been an inventor but why did he make this film he could have filmed a baby being fed & it would have been better. people might say i'm being harsh on the times but would you enjoy something like this from what i have said edison may have made the lightbulb but why did he make this particular movie. well i might sound like a complete a##hole but watch this on youtube then you will see this abomination. i still can't believe this film is completely awful. all in all the worst short film i have ever seen.rating: 1/10

we see thomas edison, with a glowing smile on his face, trying to electrocute a 5 ton living being. eventually he was successful, and so the first animal snuff film is born, cleverly disguised as an amazing achievement in technology. this is scientific arrogance at it's worst, folks. it ranks up there with the doctor who decapitated a monkey just to prove that he could keep its severed head alive for 22 minutes.oh yes, there's the absurd excuse that the elephant had been convicted of "murder" and sentenced to death, and that this was a fair and humane "execution". to all the people who are satisfied with this sophistry, please form a line on my right. i'm going to give you all a big collective three stooges slap across the head.go watch "the advocate" (1993), a movie based on the true story murder trial of a pig in mideval france. 500 years later, humans are still a bunch of morons i see.what's next? we arrest birds for stealing our blueberries? arrest pricker bushes for assault and battery? thomas edison, i hope you have a big fat worm crawling through your eye socket right now. oh wait, that would be trespassing, wouldn't it? lol

this vicious little film is horrendous. my low rating for it comes for two main reasons. the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach. filmed over a hundred years ago, i can only hope that we've evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. this film is complete and utter exploitation, made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. historical interest aside, this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination.reason number two? look at the way that the camera is set up. it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect: long march forward of the elephant, perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses. sickening.thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren't in doubt. nobody is perfect, but when you realize that this film provided a) an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and b) he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of dc as opposed to ac, you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too dispassionate and cold. any number of peter cushing's mad scientists would be proud. the rest of us should be ashamed and revolted.

"the wizard of menlo park" was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the motion picture camera, the electric car battery, the electric power grid (possibly his most important but least recalled invention), the pre-fabricated house, and innovations to the telephone and telegraph, as well as the ticker-tape machine and an early voting machine. the total number of patents is over 1,000 - far more than any other american inventor.but edison was a ruthless business competitor. he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals. the best example is the telephone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell. actually edison's invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876, but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop. still it was part of the huge 1888 supreme court decision that was the longest u.s. supreme court decision (a single volume of their reports!) written by chief justice morrison waite - which, by the way, killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing it.in 1886 edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities. this was george westinghouse, inventor of the railroad air break. westinghouse's firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor, and former edison assistant, nicola tesla. tesla developed "alternating current", which was a rival system to edison's "direct current". edison's system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity. tesla's system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another - actually it was a better, and more efficient system. but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign.it started with electric power lines. edison early on had his lines put underground, so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions. but westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open - like telephone lines. when there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on westinghouse's lines (in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattan's business district), edison started insisting that a.c. current was far more dangerous that d.c.one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting westinghouse a.c. generators and dynamos for an electric chair. edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair, but he helped several lesser figures along the way - for the complete story read mark essig's edison & the electric chair (new york: walker & company, 2003). edison experiment himself with cats and dogs (experiments he was glad to show the public). in the long run, despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution, edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current. but he never stopped trying.in 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against westinghouse and a.c. with his invention of the motion picture camera. he assisted in "putting down" a well known public elephant ("topsy") who had killed several men. he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with a.c. but the entire killing is on film - and one can view it to this day. it is a pitiful looking film - whatever poor "topsy" had done it was a poor beast - not a machiavellian murderer. the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant, we are aware it will soon be over, but the sudden collapse of "topsy" is still an unpleasant sight to view. the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences. yet, sad to say, it probably made a profit for edison - his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here. in 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it. one is glad that more people are appalled by it today - sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit.

surely this deserves to be in the bottom 10 films of all time, pity it's just a tv movie. rubbish that only we british can produce! it perhaps has some merit in the so awful it's good scale. watch out for scene where they start dancing !

this movie is such a total waste of time. i can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash. oh, i would have loved it when i was seven years old. i think a seven year old child may have written and directed it.there's no script, no acting, just rubbish. the best acting is that by the fighting roosters. i think i could whip these ninjas and i am not someone you'd consider tough. totally unconvincing and did not spark the least bit of interest. i was yawning, and laughing, by the end of the first ten minutes of the film. this is one that would turn people away from martial art movies. great comedy, bad action flick.

this movie is recommended only for insomniacs: it will relieve them by putting them to sleep. five-year-olds might also enjoy it. but for anyone else (including fans of the genre), what a bore! the "ancient" plot is reminiscent of "return of the dragon", and this film is just as inept, but nero is no bruce lee, so "enter the ninja" is an even worse film. until now, this is the second (the offensive "comedy" "bachelor party" was the first) film i gave 1/10 to.

i stumbled across this movie late at night on tv. my brother and i could not stop laughing at how god awful this movie is. the crappy sound effects whenever white ninja or black ninja punch, kick, or use a weapon is hilarious. this movie is almost on the same level as the evil dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because of shear crappiness. i'm not sure if the director meant for it to be so crappy on purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it.

franco nero stars as cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy frank landers (alex courtney) and his fetching wife (susan george) to protect them from a mobster (christopher george) who wants the land. things get even more complicated when the mobster hires cole's old nemesis (sho kosugi) who is also a ninja. inept martial arts actioner, while having better production values then most ninja movies, fails to inject any life into the surroundings, or for that matter actionscenes. a poor effort all around.

terrible action movie in which lead franco nero exchanges his cowboy hat, gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in django (1966) for an all-white ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it! despite virtually non-stop action, the film is utterly clichéd and unintentionally funny - with a campy villain, to boot, in christopher george. susan george (no relation) is the attractive woman with a washed-up husband, nero's wartime companion, whom the villains are trying to push off her oil-rich land - but the latter haven't counted upon nero's martial-arts (and stunt-heavy) gymnastics. the solution to their problems is to hire a similarly-skilled ninja for themselves who, as it happens, turns out to be nero's deadly enemy (played by sho kosugi, who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another!). the climax takes place inside an arena where one-man army nero 'eliminates' george and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations; the subtle way in which he despatches his nemesis, however, is effectively done.

a combat veteran, fresh from completion of ninjutsu training, reunites with an old friend in manila and gets caught up in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron.but, do you really care about that? if you're even reading this page, you must know something of what to expect. it's your typical chop-socky, complete with ridiculous dialouge, mega-corny villains, apocalyptic sound editing, and a camera that begs for your attention. the only reason for being seen in public with this film is the fight sequences, wonderfully choreographed by mike stone and true master sho kosugi. franco nero ain't no slouch either, assuming you can see around the mustache.well, i'm being too harsh. there are some good laughs--enjoy christopher george repeatedly screaming "ninja!" and delivering arguably the goofiest death scene ever captured on film.

this is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome!!! it has everything an early eighties movie needs: flared pants, big moustaches, chicks with farrah hair, and most importantly, ninjas!!!! i have a few choice moments to recant for you. cole's army buddy has a strange monkey-like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. he gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film. at one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy's hired goons and frank, i think his name is frank, is so moved he shouts to the whole group "lets have a cock fight!!" and they all gleefully move to the cock fighting area of the farm to begin the festivities. this is funny on every level possible. whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart. another funny thing is sho kosugi's little grunts and over animated ninja style movements. i remember this dude from when i was a kid and he used to say he was the world's only real ninja (he had ads in martial arts magazines) if i remember correctly. my friends and i were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and i can recall seeing it in the local theater many times. i was wondering as i watched this on starz last night why every sleazy american gangster type always has a stronghold in the phillipines and wears a white steve martin suit. as a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in requiring all of his thugs to wear white steve martin suits. there is a scene where it looks like 20 steve martin impersonators are attacking a 1970's sears underwear model (cole). as we wind up for the final battle cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires off a round from his pump action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care. cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, proceeds to sneakily ascend a staircase then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are. the second in charge tells him he didn't need to kill everybody as they were expecting him, then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge cock fighting arena. don't ask me why cock fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is. when they arrive cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it. the final battle is approaching as cole has killed everybody and now sho, as i like to call him, reveals himself to have kidnapped cole's lady aka frank's wife, and they meet in the snazziest cockfighting arena you ever saw. sho then, very politely i might add, releases said lady and the battle is about to start. they do their bowing and start circling each other, both masked by the way. when they join in battle it appears cole becomes someone else intermittently ala "finishing the game" a funny spoof on completing bruce lee's "game of death". cole eventually comes out on top, kills sho, who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well. next we see cole, after ruining everyone's life is about to split town again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably winks at the camera, freeze frame, credits, done.

this is a very famous ninja movie but it isn't a nice movie. if you want to see some ninjas and some figures, want to know some things about ninjas see this movie. this movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia.first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best. you can just see ninja figures and fight in this scenes. between these are below the average, nearly bad as a movie. acting is bad. sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. frank nero is a good actor and charismatic but he cannot fight good. scenario is also not good. its so simple. franko nero comes near to his best , old friend from army and war. he also protects him from mafia but he is having sex ( go to bed ) with his wife and his friend knows this but don't say anything to nero negative. is this possible in life ? what a friendship !finally this movie started a genre ; ninja movies. also there is the ninja master sho kasugi but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo. this film is below the average even it is a classic.

any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it. otherwise i can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.the fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable. instead of casting franco nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead. in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie. nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar. his kicks and punches are lame.there's enough of old action movies with good action. this is just a waste of time.

a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. this is a very tedious film to watch. richard kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff. you are taken on a ride of slow build ups, one after the other with minor revelations at best. at certain moments, i thought to myself, this will have major significance at the end, but nothing does. the film just leaves one thinking, "this story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense." i will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so.

enter the ninja (1981) was the first of several "ninja" films produced by cannon starring or co-starring japanese sensation sho kosugi. but the star of the first "ninja" film was legendary tough guy franco nero. sadly not even mr. nero or sho kosugi couldn't make this film watchable. when you have two bad dudes in an action film and it's neither watchable or fun, somethings amiss. but i digress. skip this chapter and watch the next films in the series. they're more interesting and a whole lot of fun.next is revenge of the ninja. instead of playing the "evil oriental" (i use that term tongue in cheek mind you). he's the star! strange for a western film. watch that one instead.not recommended except for die hard sho kosugi fans or cannon film buffs.

this film simply has no redeeming features. the story is incomprehensible, and the script is gross, sadistic, and stupid. the sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. the music is awful. the acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. a half star dud. shame on directv for putting it on pay-per-view. in a theater, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.

circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well , however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with .... did i lose you? well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer , it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially famke janssen shines as lily but sadly gets a lot of useless screen time just standing there doing nothing.....the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors especially john and famke who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing who every second....

i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on `circus' from `awesome, breathtaking, brilliant' and most things between right down to `golden turkey candidate'. i find myself in the latter camp.the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over-the-top violence with barrages of four-letter expletives they'd have another `lock, stock and two smoking barrels' on their hands. a pity that they forgot to include wit, style, charm and flair. and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles' classic `the lady from shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be.john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity, a huge american drives around in a mini minor as `circus' pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful amanda donohoe can't add any class to these proceedings.if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime `wonderland'

would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a "british neo-noir" crime film with a cast almost entirely american? the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful! but entirely in keeping with the performances, which are so wooden, one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire.really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is this? even neo-noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for, even if they're wretched and doomed; they at least have some decency to them, some sense that what they've done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that somehow they're stuck with the responsibility for it.not in this stanky stew. these characters are putrid, betraying each other, themselves, and the audience.also, note that they are low-lives - all right, nothing wrong with that - except that they seem to be living a life of luxury. for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves, the keynote here is - ennui. it's all so terribly dull and dross, doncha know. so let's just rip some people off or maybe murder them, and go get laid in a luxury hotel. what ambition! gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are: boringly uneven pacing; predictable 'action' sequences that aren't; banal and incoherent set-design; made-for-bad-tv camera-work and editing; forgettable score; and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction.wholly unbelievable, unlikeable, and for less dedicated movie watchers(or masochists) like myself, utterly unwatchable.there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film, but they wouldn't print them here. suffice it to say, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film - just about anything, in fact.

set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy, 'the box' was directed by richard kelly ('donnie darko'), and stars cameron diaz and james marsden as norma and arthur lewis, a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher, he as an optical specialist at nasa's langley, virginia, research center. they have one child, walter (sam oz stone).one day the lewises find a parcel on their doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. there is a note from a 'mr. steward' indicating that he will return at 5:00 pm to explain about the box.the mysterious arlington steward, played by frank langella, shows up at the appointed time, nattily attired in an elegant savile row suit. he is polite but businesslike, however his most noticeable feature is his face, half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, however he is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup, which resembles that of harvey 'two face' dent (aaron eckhart) from christopher nolan's 'the dark knight.' it's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting.steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. if, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, he will give them $1 million cash. the only catch--and it's a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. it might be across town, it might be on another continent, however steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. as a show of good faith, he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill, theirs to keep whether they push the button or not.arthur and norma are skeptical, believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax, however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? would they really get a million dollars? would somebody really die? weary of the speculation, norma slaps the button. nothing happens. however, their initial relief gives way to alarm when steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. they decide to call the whole thing off, however steward tells them it's too late. "you've already pushed the button," he explains. as steward's limo pulls away, arthur notes the license number, which he later discovers is registered to the nsa (national security agency).at this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. meanwhile, the town becomes invaded by pudgy, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?), where steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen till now--and informs arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'what happens if i choose the wrong one?', arthur asks, seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'eternal damnation,' the spinster says ominously.arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering over norma's bed. when she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden marsden and diaz flop around on the bed.it's confusing, i know.we eventually learn that steward was once the public relations officer for the nsa, until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. he was pronounced dead, but later came back to life, having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the cia, the nsa, and nasa all by himself.and what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? apparently, steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g., the 'binding of isaac'), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. if enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. unfortunately, those people who do push the button, such as norma and arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'lady or the tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot.'the box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. richard kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals, as with the mixing together of too many colors, into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap.there is a point in 'the box' where arthur, who is a technically-minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. opening up the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside.having seen the box, i know exactly how he feels.

this must be the first movie i've rented and not seen to the end. complete garbage! the acting, the plot, set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot. not even a b move.

s l o w, l o n g, d u l l. . .oh my god, dull. characters so annoying - you'll cringe every time you see jimy smits, or the guy that played tomtom from now on. they must have never rehearsed or reviewed the film in progress. mel gibson was absolutely wooden.this may not be the worst movie ever made, but that it went almost straight to video says it is darn close.

i rented this movie on 20 june 2001, and watched it for about 45 minutes. i concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison. there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and swallowed the whole bunch of them.so, i e-mailed all of my friends and relatives warning them, and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! i have seen some really bad movies in my time, but never one as bad as this.

pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not constitute a 'movie'. like all pop promos, mdh's pretentions are are outdone only by its' unjustifiable budget. one dollar spent on this aimless, purposeless dross was one dollar too many. stick to penning pop songs bono.

without being really the worst science fiction film ever made, or the worst i have seen, 'time under fire' is still much under average. the premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, it starts as a x-files story, combining bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together, but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series. soon, 'time under fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés, not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. acting is bad, and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.

it's the one film i almost walked out of, and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me. normally, even if i don't like a film, i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end. that way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. but with the million dollar hotel, it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director, one i didn't normally like so much. but coming from wenders, it was all the more shocking to behold. i know bono from u2, a good friend of wenders's, wrote the script to this abysmal film, and i wonder why wenders let him, as buddy-buddy as the two may have been. "stick to the day job, bono", is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess. pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring, with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon, especially the leads, jeremy davies, milla jovovich and mel gibson, none of whom i dislike normally. the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible. on a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2. but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered, not even close.

perhaps i'm just a simple person, but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. this was supposed to be a comedy? maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). the thing about it is, it missed on so many things. there were characters that could have been funny, but they weren't. there were characters that you could have liked, but you didn't. for instance, the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs. there was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. haha. and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the walrus' scene like it was special. what? he played 'i am the walrus' on an old piano and sang out of tune. is there an inside joke there? it sure stank at face value. this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/garbage message the artist is expressing. if you want to be entertained, stay away.

this movie just stunk. i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good "just doesn't get it." i like wenders in american friend and wings of desire. but this is utter dreck. the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does. he is, as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey. i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care. this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be goofey or weird. i liked the mel gibson character and the milla jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them. milla is of course beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is. i see gibsons character as almost frankenstien like. i just wish he would have save milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. milla rating 10 movie rating 0

even mel gibson couldnt save this slop of a movie. this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he couldnt sit and watch? what was this? a total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrinic lady, who was also on some heavy ilicit street drugs. for all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs; you will love this movie.

riccardo freda may have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great mario bava; it's clear that he wasn't one of italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies. this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot; it's a sprawling mess and overall, i'd even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than freda's insipid giallo effort, the iguana with the tongue of fire. freda apparently disowned this movie, and i certainly don't blame him! the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. they happen upon a house while searching for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony...ho hum. the film features a lead role for camille keaton, who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers. the film features one decent gore scene towards the end, but this really isn't enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that don't make sense - but even i couldn't stand this one. miss it, miss nothing!

on the way home from a day at the beach, four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of lord and lady alexander after their car runs out of gas. they don't know it, but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a satanic ritual. jane (camille keaton), the only female of the group, is to be sacrificed. as her male companions rush to her aid, one of them accidentally kills lady alexander. things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed. the four try to make an escape, but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed. one by one, they meet their fates.gong into tragic ceremony, i was positive i would enjoy it. slow-burn gothic horror is right up my alley. i'm also quite fond of some of riccardo freda's other movies like the horrible dr. hichcock, the ghost, and i vampiri. tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. unfortunately, things don't always work out the way they should. the biggest tragedy with respect to tragic ceremony is the time i spent watching this mess of a movie. with a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me. the characters are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is terrible. there's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further. in addition, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. by the time the four leads realize they're in danger, i was well past the point of caring. and i don't understand the reviews i've read that praise the acting of camille keaton. i suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting. the three male leads are the very definition of nondescript. they do nothing to stand out. the supporting cast includes some genre favorites like luigi pistilli, luciana paluzzi, and paul muller, but none is given anything to do. in fact muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes. it's a weak attempt to provide a wrap-up to a very weak movie.

this late-ish effort from freda plays as a modern day (70's that is) gothic thriller, but comes out short of thrills. certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film, it's jut got that feeling which many of freda's later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first daily's. it starts out good enough, almost giallo like in tone, then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent (albeit terribly cliché) set up. then suddenly freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles. then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent-to-poor special effects. this is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending (if it's even intended to be a twist?). and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony. thus in parts it's got its qualities. but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you. a pity.btw stay away from the sharoma dvd, a useless murky pan& scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience.

i will repeat - what a stupid scenario.is there anything new inside? i don't know who have wrote this. but i believe this guy have watch all hollywood -children -family -teens movies ever made... all scenes and dilouges u can see in everywhere. why do u people making this movies? children's like an adults? they like money gold cars... and they are positives? they have lucky... and emotions of course... without it can be done. o the young actors - wow :-). i do like when is camera concentrated on their nice faces? what a crap... there is 90% better children movies that this one! this is not creative or funny movie. this is simply nothing.d.

this is one of those "family" movies that i can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9. a group of siblings discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle, to which they've been evacuated from the london blitz. ...and there you have it, all in one sentence. the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled, but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children (or vice versa!). the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.

the great war breaks out and daddy is a brave pilot who goes off to carry out some unsightly business to put jerry in his place. mummy is doing her bit as a nurse, so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country, where a secret passageway takes them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure.based on a book written the best part of a century ago, they don't make stories like this anymore. and there's a reason. the men fly planes and author books; the women change bandages and clean house. the boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime furloughs; the girls do what they are told and play violin - badly. fat kids who wear specs are nasty. all the kids speak in those clipped, vowel-flattening accents that are soppy and prim but which a certain economic class of english people cultivate. on top of the snobbery and yearning for imperial albion, there are plot holes a five-year-old would not tolerate. i mean that literally - my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset, why the compass didn't just drop from his hand as he disappeared. the film at least tries to aim strictly for the kids, until a completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue by eddie izzard (what a waste of genuine comic talent) plays over the final credits.no doubt the five percent of british schoolkids who go to expensive public schools in the uk will find it all such a jolly wheeze. for the other 95 percent of british families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is wall-e, ratatouille and wallace and gromit are all out on dvd.

where do i begin? the story was so bad, it must have been written in a high school film club! the acting was so wooden i felt sorry for the actors! one actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights! another actor has this constant look of being constipated! but it was the dialog that takes the cake! our hero says to his captors - all holding submachine guns - if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead. moments later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only women prisoner go at it. when our fearless leader, who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression, he calmly walks up to the guard, while machine guns are trained on him, and in a split-second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! he then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially yell at him!i could go on and on! this movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor, it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!

1st watched 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10(dir-john stephenson): mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight & work in world war i as england entered the war. they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle's mansion, which of course they do over and over, and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down. this is the "it" referred to in the title, created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard. the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from. this part of the movie is not done very well because it's obvious the children, primarily the freddie highmore character, do not learn from them but instead keep going back to "it" to solve their next big problem. "it" is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. so, all in all, this was an ok film but could have been much better.

i would think that this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on, were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar. it is certainly possible for a great film to be "based" very loosely on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the former.there were a number of flaws. one was that it tried to be too much like the railway children, probably because adults would expect this, being from the same author. another is that it also sought to be too like harry potter, down to the music and in overemphasizing the setting. i have nothing against j k rowling or the films but the book is just nothing like the harry potter ones. i thought the psammead, though very well voiced by eddie izzard and in character too, was almost gratuitously in a totally inappropriate environment. i may have missed something here, as the comments made about one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. there was also no need for the extra characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they weren't.i saw this film with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesn't. the one who does know it thought it was all right but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't. i'm not sure what this means.

schieder delivers a semi-believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria conchita alonzo as the female vice president. the movie just stinks. with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on. relegated to late night hbo time schedules, this film is not worth seeing at all. 10 minutes into it, you are asking yourself why it was written. 40 minutes into it, you are wondering why you are watching it. save the effort and watch a re-run of hee haw or something. anything is better than this clunker.

ugh. this movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess. the story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. we're actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk. if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the president's protectors, then we're all in trouble. roy scheider turns in a good performance as the president, but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of patrick muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk). perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise--or, perhaps someone will see it and say, "hey, if they can get a movie this bad made, maybe i can, too!"

the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichés it is rehashing. snarling chinese gangsters. a female vice-president. a ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big caucasian male. shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy. a situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent armageddon. independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball. the vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates, while the chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining, snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters. a lone hero left alone in a ship (building, airplane, whatever) wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons. etc., etc., etc.the second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario. i counted up to 45. a president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel. the impossibly non-overridable command from the nuke box. the part where the chinese decided to play shoot 'em up. etc., etc. man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen. i admit the film was interesting until the point the evil taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president. then the boredom kicked in. suspension of disbelief ceased, and i started thinking the fun i'd have torturing this film...

drab, dreary and a total waste of my time. the plot is incomprehensible (so don't think about it too much). the acting is odd and wooden - i would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting, but that might be an insult to body builders. there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but lots of fires, explosions, a gratuitous sex scene, etc. the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclear...hmmm. is roger corman psychic? let's hope that "iraq" was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn't come true. 

"son you must stop the experiments i have started!!" too bad nobody said this too whoever green lighted this project!! i was almost literally dragged to this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight showing when we were in high-school. now, a midnight movie in high-school on a friday night, you are not expecting much, but c'mon!! and upon seeing it again years later i sill stand by my original opinion of it. great special effects but so what!! quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. unless you enjoy blood and guts and seeing some hollywood vets (steiger & hunter) make fools of themselves for a buck. yuck!!!

the kindred opens to shots of a porsche racing along a highway, it catches up with an old pick-up truck and gets held up. as it speeds past the pick-up the driver (benjamin j.perry as ben perry) shouts obscenities and honks his horn. distracted he doesn't notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his porsche. he is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital. on the way the paramedic (randy harrington) trying to save him suggests that he probably won't make it. then the ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van. the driver of the van, jackson (jim boeke as james f.boeke) beats the paramedic up and steals the patient. the ambulance driver, harry (charles grueber) makes no attempt to stop him. once the injured man has been placed into the van jackson turns his attention to harry whom seem to know each other. harry asks jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw 'last time'. jackson punches harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him. the film then makes it perfectly clear we are in san fransisco by showing a shot of the golden gate bridge. sharon raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend dr. john hollins (david allen brooks) to inform him that his mother, amanda (kim hunter) who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness. hollins works for a company called the 'geneticell corporation' and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her. once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called shelter cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments, especially the 'anthony journals' which hollins has never heard of, she also claims that he has a brother named anthony. back at geneticell, hollins talks with a dr. phillip lloyd (rod steiger) about his mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other, and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called anthony. he claims he knows nothing. when amanda dies after a visit from the sinister dr. lloyd, hollins decides to carry out his mothers request and try to find out who anthony is. while paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named melissa leftridge (amanda pays) introduces herself to hollins and says she was a big admirer of his mothers work and research after she helped her. because melissa seems to know so much about his mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has. hollins, sharon, melissa and three lab assistants, brad baxter (peter frechette), hart phillips (timothy gibbs) and cindy russell (julia montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon(!) named nell valentine (bunki z, great name what were her parents thinking!?). they get down to business straight away but find little of any interest. for some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement, which is just as well as there's something down there, something large, slimy and has lots of tentacles. first it kills duke, the dog. then it moves on to larger prey. when hart is attacked by something in a barn hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his mothers work and whatever anthony is. jointly co-written and directed by stepehn carpenter and jeffery obrow, carpenter also acted as cinematographer and obrow as producer. this is a pretty poor film in my opinion. the script is credited to five(!) writers, carpenter, obrow, earl ghaffari, john penny and joseph stefano and with five people working on it i'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this. nothing is explained that well, why did amanda create these monstrous sea creature/human hybrids? what is dr. lloyd's interest and his motives? why does he steal bodies from the back of ambulance's? why does he have a basement full of mutants? why do none of these so-called genetic scientists think to check the basement out? could melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried? why are none of the characters given any background? why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called hemocynine when 99.9% of the audience isn't going to have clue what their on about? there is also a serious lack of blood and gore, only one person dies on screen, just one! and all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy 'happy ending'. this is a horror film guys, all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways. the one on screen death is actually quite cool, someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin, in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence. to try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where dr. lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the film doesn't mean a thing. melissa also turns into a fish, don't ask. there's no nudity either, which isn't a surprise. the film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace, we don't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late, when it does make an appearance the effects are ok and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn't used more. overall i was very disappointed and i was expecting a lot better. a horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total, what's the world coming too?

i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves. i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again.however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80's horror titles in their original boxed form, that have been deleted for some time. i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list!the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn't like back then, i now own and have now re-watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a.s.a.p.hurray for the 80's and long live horror!

director todd verow's unexpected turn into sentimental coming-out drama yields a predictable result: nothing new to see here. attractive but unconvincing leads - these 20-somethings are supposed to be in high school? - dribbling out banalities about confused, adolescent sexuality doesn't strike me as the best way to explore the promise of anonymous, which was equally self-involved, but also honest, raw and, by comparison, not all that maudlin. i have no idea what to make of this drab and uninspiring movie other than to hope that verow finds another career. sure, it's unpretentious, but so's mike huckabee.no single attribute, however, is as awful as jim dwyer's chintzy, electronic score, which grates non-stop, wall-to-wall for the full length of this movie. if i'd seen this, and heard this, in a theatre, i would have walked out. thankfully, on my laptop, i could scrub and hit mute.

awful is really all one needs to know. first think of all the things that could be bad about a movie. and then try to make a movie that is bad in all of these ways. you will have made "vacationland." the state of maine should feel insulted: it's much too nice a place to serve as the backdrop for such trite, mindless, boring schlock. i'm a romantic, and i always want movies about two people finding each other to succeed, and i tried hard to find the good in this one. it was tough; very tough. i couldn't find a glimmer of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise in humdrum dreariness. except maybe in one or two of the bad guys.maine is a good vacationland; this movie is not.

who's responsible for these "behind the scenes" things? who are these actors? did they crawl out from beneath rocks? 'yuks, lots of yuks!' no. no yuks for me. only loathing and shame that i am a human being. i have to avert my eyes from the set, it's so embarrassing. in fact, i changed the channel.i've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings, but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. watching someone who isn't funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity.please stop making these absolutely horrifying tv movies. please.

arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. however, the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him. it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. yet, oddly, hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! i think this was actually done as padding, as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.later, in the "surprise twist", he comes upon heaven--or at least his concept of the place. he's invited in, but since they won't allow dogs, he has other ideas! overall, reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! with no twists or irony, this episode is a bit dull--not "twilight zone-y" enough for my tastes.

stephen king tv movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? so why give the stooges only 96 minutes? i'm not asking for a pbs mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? the movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. i do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the stooges, but the spirit was there. after watching the movie, i pulled out a tape from american movie classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. the movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after curly has the stroke and moe needs to keep the business going. when curley started crying i lost it...like i said, the movie was good, but could have been and should have been much, much better. maybe it's fitting though...the stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.

this production is an insult to the stooges, especially moe. it is inaccurate and poorly acted. many of the events depicted just didn't happen that way and too much was left out or skipped over. read the books written by moe and his daughter joan instead. this was a waste of time.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. people just don't act that way in real life situations. my question is: who would fund such crap?the movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes. one guy falls and breaks his leg or something. the fireman arrives to help them. meanwhile, somebody starts a fire. some more bike stunts. bla bla bla.i wasted my time.do not watch this movie.

a bunch of teen dirt bikers are out in the forest riding around in circles. they're having fun; little do they know nature is about to be unleashed by an emo refugee from a deliverance or hills have eyes movie. he's armed with matches and fire accellerant. and he's got an eye that's bleeding or something. why torch a park? i dunno. maybe he doesn't like smokey the bear, or something. but he wears army/navy store fatigues, if that helps.the rangers send one single helicopter to battle the resulting blaze; that's all you ever see, except a bunch of people in a base somewhere talking a lot about the fire, but doing nothing. some cop or ranger or militiaman or whatever he is drops from the helicopter on a defective tether.everybody now rides their dirt bikes like they're auditioning for motocross. they forever pop wheelies, do evel knievel jumps, spin around etc. they argue incessantly. shots of the fire are as phony as a 3 dollar bill; it's the same footage from a dozen different angles, and the blaze never grows or moves. and you still never once see any fire fighting equipment.syfy channel movie which has about 0% science fiction attached to it. what you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects, and a story that goes nowhere (like the bikes and fire go nowhere). laughable insomniac cure.

when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire, which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. i don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. and lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. and to make things worse i have the whole set on dvd fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche. all i'm missing is the awesome tornado movie which i hear sucks balls.well until my next crap movie peace

as a south african, living in south africa again after a 32 year stay in the uk, i am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment. the three main problems i had with the movie was a) why swank and ejiofor - an american and a nigerian - to play the leads. this country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports... b) gillian slovo has been trading off her struggle credentials for years now. she's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of mr hooper... and c) hilary swank again, such a great actor, as proved in million dollar baby (but that's eastwood too), here dressed in the contemporary new york style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the karoo. where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? yes, the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown. heart's in the right place but needs a pace maker.

**major spoilers** watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it "nature unleashed: fire" has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history. we have the fearless ranger jake, bryan genesse, leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume beaching mine shaft! this during a raging forest fire! it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire!***spoilers from this point on*** all this started some time ago when ranger jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner tiny, chris harz aka "the sherd", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the tiny was the culprit! as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him, fires explosions as well as impaling, could stop the crazed miner.before tiny's reappearance, or resurrection, ranger jake got involved in rescuing bikers chris mel sharon & marcus, josh cohen melanie lewis anastasia griffith & ross mccall, who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them. having the usual know it all-marcus-among the bikers things don't go as smoothly as ranger jake wanted them to go. marcus not only eggs on the meek chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but has the guy break his leg. this makes it almost impossible for ranger jake to have chris air-lifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers!for the remainder of the movie ranger jake, who put himself in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers! all this ends with jake's brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them!even though he was supposed to be the life of the party, or movie, tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun. the make-up job on tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp.ranger jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules forest ranger. in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because tiny , despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!

don't see this movie! it's... repulsive! the start is indeed very good, but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest. awful picture! the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert gustavsson, lena nyman and gösta ekman.hope you take my advise... the picture is rubbish.

if i could give this movie a negative rating i would. the humor is the cruelest i have ever seen in a film. horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. there are 2 plots, neither of which supports half of a film. where is the "depth" others see in this movie? that no good deed goes unpunished? that only the heartless can succeed? the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought "schindler's list" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.

set in 1945, skenbart follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to berlin. unfortunately for everyone around him, he's a walking disaster, causing mayhem everywhere he goes. the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife (who's also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two gay elderly gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a bunch of refugees, and even more people.meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - at least to begin with), and comedy, the film fails with both. it doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene. and as the train races towards its final destination, the film turns more and more bizarre, ending on a truly surreal note.the good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters. skenbart is packed with famous swedish actors, no matter how small the part is. it feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film. too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (act your lines - don't read them!).the comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same jokes repeated over and over. the pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often, actually) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason. the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. the film looks great though, in moody b&w, but it's wasted on such inept film-making in every other department. [1/10]

outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. happy you. the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history. and still.. seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie, trying to copy a younger gösta ekman. ekman, by the way, is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. credit that can be given is for the photo, splendid idea using black and white. music is ok.but over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.

i had this movie given to me, and have to admit, i am glad that i did not pay money for it.the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. but the reality in this movie is far from that.in reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all.even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.but jaded has none of this. it concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. and the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.while it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.if at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs.

"jaded" offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question "when is rape not rape?". unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly. "jaded" is lame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama.

hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (i.e., the writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). christopher plummer, veteran of 129 movies, frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck. i guess there is nothing wrong with that, but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it.it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb. art? if you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. comedy? watch a re-run of the flintstones, about the same plot with less time wasted.dabney coleman gives his usual performance, for better or worse. and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie. but plummer???? it was embarrassing to watch his performance, in fact i was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie, knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame! i see from his bio that he called sound of music "sound of mucus", so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.i wonder if today he was asked, how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is, what would he say.....?probably something like "where the money is"....

i'm a boorman fan, but this is arguably his least successful film. comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done. still, it's almost worth seeing for boorman's eye for talent: this is one of uma thurman's first starring roles, and as always she is ravishing to watch. (on a sad side note, boorman wrote the script with his daughter, telsche, who died a couple years ago.)

i say this. if you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. if you want to see a movie, you go to a theater. trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in "where the heart is". an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment. you like dabney coleman, see "short time". you like crispin glover, see "bartleby". you like uma thurman, see "kill bill". above all, if you like christopher plummer, see "the silent partner", because his character here, is a terrible embarrassment. in fact this entire production is an embarrassment. sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a short, but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense, masquerading as filmed entertainment. - merk

after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street...this movie is an absolute no-brainer! the jokes (if this is the right word for it...) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all. save the money and get drunk. you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted, perhaps!

it really is terrible, from start to finish you'll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot, thinking hes cool when he's really not, rubbish plot line, terrible acting and complete waste of time and money, do not bother.

^^contains spoilers^^this movie is utter crap. do not watch.there is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.the acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. no one can even cry believably.if you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make no sense whatsoever.for example, i left the room for a second, while jennie garth's character was sleeping with her manager. i come back, seriously about 4 minutes later, (also i'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there) and she's sleeping with that berko guy. i gave up on this movie around the time that berko was being an ass to his fiancé in the car, because she didn't want to call off the wedding.i wasted 2 hours of my life. you shouldn't.

as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel 124. it is an urban channel. i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. i almost became a mass murderer due to this film. i have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of dookie. the lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. i would rather watch star crystal....... holy cow maybe that is not a good example. the main question i have about this film is... was it to be a morality film? the reason why i ask is because ther was one line where this lady in a wheelchair says " i would have been another gang statistic" oh my head is starting to hurt. after hearing that line i went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared watch this movie. but some sense kicked in and i just changed the channel to watch the man with the afro paint. well that is all i have to say about this movie. if you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes

i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back. it was so bad, i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. the only plot summary i can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high.(spoiler alert starts here...) when the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the "demon cop", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong. a car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. it sends him flying over the top of it, and what does the driver do??? watches the man as he falls, gets back in his car and drives away. what kind of hair-brained dolt would do that? i would've at least asked if the guy was okay.then, some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face, then, later tells reporters, "i didn't get a good look at him." my sisters and i, by then, were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter.then, there's some scene in an alley, where this girl with an afro, pulls a machine gun out of her teeny-weeny little purse. it couldn't have possibly fit!! i can hardly remember certain scenes. maybe it's because they were just that bad.cops in the film can't even jump a fence, and the acting is so wooden, it makes planks of wood look like better actors.all in all, this movie brings shame to hollywood, way more than any other flop could. you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot, which it has none of, as far as i can tell.

one night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. though tempted to turn it off, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. alas, there was none. absolutely nothing. the film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. then again, there was precious little to salvage. after a few minutes of cameron mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally terrible acting, and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. the rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous "special effects" and "makeup" to ever disgrace the screen, even for television. the main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. one can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. seriously, a handful of three-year-old kids could've produced a better project. at the end, poor mr. mitchell returns (how desperate he must've been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the aids epidemic. please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. it was so bad, even mystery science theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it.

this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. to me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. i saw this film as weak and boring. at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. at times i wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. this movie just wasn't good for me.

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. if you're looking for a nice theatrical effect, skip it and watch something else.but if you're looking for camp-value, this is it. here's my advice: gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it.

this movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free, and that it probably helped the romanian economy. other than that, hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in mississippi. to go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. it wasn't. i remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing. whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be relocated to another sector of society...maybe food service, to the deaf. if you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem oscar-worthy in retrospect. then again, if you actually ended up at this movie's profile, i imagine that it may be too late...

i like ali g's show, i believe the guy has comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to a talent.the movie is a little worse than i was expecting. i don't find ali-g offensive, just stupid. jokes for 5-year olds, some good, some terrible.if you want to watch a movie that seems "offensive", but is actually funny, see tom green's 'freddy got fingered'.2/10

this story starts at the end ! so the film's opening credits advise us. unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950's. the story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.the scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke. - oh yes there was a pool of water as well. someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers.written by lou rusoff, who penned several sci-fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days, not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage. the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential. it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be.mike connors and richard denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- 'i enjoyed that film' richard denning's acting career began in 1937. he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five-o and the flying doctor series.directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer. he has made some good films and is still making them. he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe, often starring vincent price. he also made other low budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than this.i would not recommend this film to anyone.darnmay 10th september 2007

this is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. the cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.they all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie. harvey cormann's first film, it shows a certain simplicity in movie making. to avoid expensive sets, actors go through curtains to enter and exit the house (ie the studio). the location shots filmed in the hills near hollywood are the backdrop.i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s.

a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. it's the end of the world. four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. a mutant monster! seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed "a million years of evolution" (on an already living human) the result is a laughably bad, zip up the back, rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water. it rains. the monster dissolves. the remaining two characters, the hunk and the virgin. set out to repopulate the world as the caption 'the beginning' fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around 'out there'.the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of 'curtain acting' that goes on in it. one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the superabundant use of curtains in the set design. it was cheap. finished with one set-up? pull a curtain across, drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting.'curtain acting' is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in ("it looks like rain", or "here they come now, and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them!", that sort of stuff). he'll do this by standing to one side of the window - reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot - ie towards the camera - thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen, without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. there was a lot of that in this movie.

a group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending h-bomb blast. not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. one of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. richard denning plays the hero. mike connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. lori nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. not one of director roger corman's best. this is predictable black and white sci-fi.

that distinction has to go to the dungeon of harrow. at least ed wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "star" power of bela lugusi, vampira, tor johnson, criswell and lyle talbot. the dungeon of harrow has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. what could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of the island of dr. moreau or mysterious island, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. the "special effects", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a victorian interpretation of the bible. the fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat fallon and his lady, cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the castle de sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. it is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. no wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end.

this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, some spare paint and cardboard,a toy ship, a few friends who acted in community theater, and the incorrect notion you can make a film. the end result is an unwatchable time-waster that you'll skip through, unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first.the acting in the opening scene (especially by the rotund lee morgan as 'captain') and the toy ship "crashing" into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you're in for (with all the foam, it looks like this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink. i guess boyette figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time). in terms of bad cinema, the funny thing is "dungeon of harrow" seems to have inspired (maybe by coincidence) the twist ending of "manos: the hands of fate". yep, it's the same lame "i was the victim, and now i take the mad villain's place" ironic ending. the bigger irony is that two inept, talentless filmmakers could make two equally-wretched, texas-filmed horror movies and get away with it.monotone nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line (why they were great is never broached), boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes (we're also treating to a droning narration throughout the film). sadly, we aren't so lucky. his family's toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink, and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman, conveniently deposited on a mad count's island.meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a blackstone's magic kit outfit, assaults him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats. . . all the icky stuff). the count (william mcnulty) overacts worse than shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting.i'd be mad too if i had to be in this disaster. the woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs, and the two jerks are captured by his manservant. the count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he slaps his manservant around a lot (apparently his greatest joy), fatboy gets tortured, there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse, the rotting leper hag-in-a-wedding-dress countess in the dungeon (she digs the nerdy noble and is the only effective & creepy thing in the movie), a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table, the blubbery captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway (aking to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions). . . it's all an ugly haze to me. i spent most of my time on the fast-forward button.anyway, the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yeah, we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean). they don't, since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the would-be rescuers away. honestly, i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance. they head back to the castle, the nurse starts rotting like the countess (and your stomach, by this time), and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the . . . dungeon of harrow!!!! blech!i love old, lousy horror films, but they must have some sort of entertainment value. i feel ripped off, even at the low low price of $5.99 for this biscuit. mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun. i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments. wrong! avoid this tripe at all costs, and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere. this movie makes corman's "the terror" like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.

if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this stinkburger.don't get me wrong i loooooovvveeee a good crappy movie. i am a big fan of films like octoman, wizard of mars, queen king and others. real classics of b-cinema.but this film actually makes jack nicolson and boris karloff in the terror look like an academy award winner!! the dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. "i will now condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. the acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.the story? what story, a count is exiled because his wife had leprosy? i'm still not sure on that count. a (rich?) fleet one and the captian of one of his ships crash on the island? people acting unnaturally? ok, i like camp in b-films a lot, there lies a lot of it's charm, but this was just dumb..plain dumb. a salty sea captian who sounds as well versed as a college professor? a fleet owner who is as clueless as they come (i felt this guy had no idea of how to play it, one scene he's spanish acting, the next english/european)? the count, who's not sure if he's a reincarnation or really desade (don't ask me how desade figures into this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and i still couldn't figure it out.the scare factor? i could show this turkey to my small grandkids and only worry about them sleeping through it. i like a lot of early 60's horror movies, and some still have good shocks, but this thing...never had a shock, or even a hint of of a scare.on the info on the back it says, "this movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare." the only degradation is watching this movie. it's 90 mins.(the case says it's 74 mins.) of your life you do not get back.i paid only a buck, yes one buck, for this and another film. i still feel like i am owed .50 cents for even sitting though this.to sum up dungeon of harrow had no one named harrow in it, but, it did have a lovely cardboard dungeon.

why can't a movie be rated a zero? or even a negative number? some movies such as "plan nine from outer space" are so bad they're fun to watch. this is not one. "the dungeon of horror" might be the worst movie i've ever seen (some of anyway. i had to fast forward through a lot of it!). fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies i've seen, but thankfully, i can't remember them. the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. the special effects looked like a fifth grader's c+ diorama set in a shoebox. the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant. he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits. i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed. this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as "the manipulator", the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual (one time) hollywood leading man-mickey rooney. the only time i would recommend watching "the dungeon of harrow" (or "the manipulator" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (i'm kind of cheap) i'd have to have $7 or $8 bucks for "dungeon" and at least ten for "manipulator". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer

this movie tries to be more than it is. first of all, the acting is horrible. you have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. the plot is quite interesting. a shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. if this weren't bad enough, some guy named count de sade is living there as well. he lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs. there's another woman who doesn't speak and his wife, who is a leper. anyway, things get bad as these men have to deal with this nut case. he is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. the rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape. it has an ironic ending which i won't reveal and it kind of rescues the film. i wouldn't bother if i were you.

a couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. it just seems to drag on and on. and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point. as an example of 60's gothic horror, this is strictly a bargain basement example. i sadly can't recommend this one really.

i had already heard of ali g in madonna's music video "music". i always think he's funny. (in fact, he really is.) just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of "ali g indahouse". that's why some months later, i bought it cheap and i started watching it.but the movie surprised me. my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. it turns out that "indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. it was really really bad. it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. it also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. we definitely hate that movie. oh by the way, i have plans to sell it.ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows-- in such a negative way. maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). for the first time ever, i was disappointed at him. that really made me sad rather and happy.i gave this movie 1 over 10. actually, i really want to give it a 0 rating. it's one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life. i wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.

"dungeon of harrow" had a lot of things that could've made this quite a good horror film. creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. but sadly to say this wasn't made very well.a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle, his slave, and a mute maid. the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them, and the mute maid who befriends them, to torture and imprisonment. sound not-bad right? well, not quite. i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen, but now i hesitate. because it had so much potential it can't really be called "one of the worst." however, seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film. all in all, it's not a very good movie.there is a very gothic-suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride, adorned in a tattered wedding dress. this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene. man i wish this was a better movie! this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late-night chiller, but ultimately took all the wrong turns. i suggest someone remake this one.

this weird movie from texas is about fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s c&w singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by count desade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. the count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. meanwhile, creepy former nurse cassandra tells fallon the secrets of the castle. the countess has leprosy and went mad! fallon is trapped but brings supplies. the captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave. fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it's her wedding day. the leper bride is horny, bu cassandra kills her. fallon and cassandra escape the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. desade kills the slave and fallon kills desade. fallon and cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year, but when the supply ship comes, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they're both lepers now. they live for years in the castle...fallon's hair turns gray and cassandra goes bonkers. fallon puts her in the dungeon. our tale of love and leprosy ends.so bizarre it's watchable, and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.

the basic idea behind "dungeon of harrow" isn't all bad. the acting, however, is bad. the lighting is bad. the music is bad. the scenes of torture are without emotion. there really isn't much there to recommend this film. you know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say "special guest star" and list someone you've never heard of. might as well say "rex hamilton as abraham lincoln." because there's really no one in this movie you can identify. there are one or two decent moments, mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawner.

buyer beware. the alpha video release uses a print that defies description. the movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. the print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. after 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. it looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception. adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that i can recollect. even the voice over narration is stupor inducing. every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor. i found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out. for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end. it's one of those so-bad -it's- good movies but i wish that someone would find a half decent print.

my bad film guru (and the president of the exposed film society) sprang this one on us last week. there was no denying the demented gleam in his eye as he pulled it out of its brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "the most dangerous game", filmed on a budget of about $2.95.of course, $2.95 went a lot further back in 1962, but still...anyway, there is certainly a lot to dislike about this film. it abounds with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the 'repeating musket' that fired twice in two minutes without benefit of a reload). the hero is a wuss who stands by while his wounded friend fights the henchman and gets killed. more? ok -the plot is a shambles with no continuity to speak of. the movie wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' who serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows him again. the hero is choked unconscious by the henchman but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and first meets his host. the mute servant girl is captured, put on the rack...and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in this predicament) just sort of "forgets" about her. more? well, the sets are cheap, and the special effects are cheaper (the makeup is an exception to this). much of the plot is carried by the narrator's droning, monotonic voice-over, which carries less dramatic impact than the menu recital at denny's. most of the dialog is simply ridiculous and stilted , as if it was translated from japanese. ("i demand that our conversation be pleasant!!!") and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot, as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (note - this last may have been the fault of a bad print, rather than the camera crew). but there were a couple of nice moments here and there. the makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors were looked interesting, especially the mute servant girl and the countess. and in spite of everything, there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found, very nasty and disturbing.so what was the deal with this movie? i thought about it a bit, and realized that director/writer pat boyette basically tried to put a story from of the old "ec" horror comics on film. that would account for the stilted dialog, the sketchy character development (in a comic, physiognomy = character even more than in film), the loopy interior logic of the story ("ec" horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty "shock" ending and weren't big on psychological realism), the over reliance on the narrative voice (which belongs in captions over the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the grisly pictures that the old ec artists did so well.in fact, i'd be willing to bet that when boyette saw his leading man during casting, he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky, shambling figures and caved in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world.. he used costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living ec comics characters. (see: the leading lady's blank beauty, the count's strong bony features, oddly bronze skin and sharp chin, the platinum 'do on the tall, bony black henchman, etc.) this would explain the movie's failings. boyette knew how to 'frame' things, but he didn't know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. boyette knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. he wouldn't be the first person with this problem of course - look at what joel schumacher did to "batman". but he didn't have a big budget to hide behind.in any case, i'm imagine that boyette walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about "dungeon of harrow"than the folks who post on this film's message boards. he did, within certainly vague boundaries, what he set out to do, and you have to respect him for it...even if you don't care for "harrow".

**may contain spoilers**the main character, a nobleman named fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. count lorente de sade (pronounced "dee-sayd") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. he routinely beats mute servant anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. inadvertant laughs are provided by giant "nubian" slave mantis who talks with a deep south accent and helps de sade hunt down trespassers in the style of the most dangerous game. de sade's crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner. (this scene was viewed on late-night tv by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood.) the one nearly-normal person in sight is cassandra, who has self-deprecation down to a science. ("i used to be a nurse, now i'm not much of anything.") she and fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de sade and mantis combined.	this movie was shot in san antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (i'll say this much for mr. boyette--he does showcase his fixatation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) it's rather like an andy milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers. the period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the handicapped and all-around misanthropy makes one wonder if andy wasn't called in as a consultant. however, milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which looks like it was shot in a fish tank. also, a film made in texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. glorious eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves. fallon's initial encounter with the leprous countess is truly horrifying, as is the movie's parting shot. if the rest had been half as harrowing, the dungeon of harrow would have been a terror classic. instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash-fiends will love, for all the wrong reasons.

okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). this baby falls into the "so bad it's entertaining" category to me, and for that alone i would give it a star. the effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day. you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning, too! it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago. while the alpha dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something, i actually liked that in this case!

the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. the leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. so, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. you don't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company.what a load of leftest excrement! looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of communism's grip on this region for 45 years. but no, it was the american war on iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms, and the constipation i had last week.the film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block. you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair. we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight, beat her up, then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. no one sees this or calls the police, and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase. even better, we later see 4-5 women lined up in the centre of london in -again- broad daylight to be sold, one of them has a smashed face, and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening. you can't make this stupidity up.i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood, but apparently i was mistaken.

the movie begins with much voice-over, a bad sign. then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence-insulting scenes involving trappers and indians. but, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow. meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky indians sit around watching them. it's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "blazing saddles". there is a minor flaw in this comparison; "across the wide missouri" is not a comedy.

of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. even ford. but this is one of his worst. even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a bonanza or big valley. yet there is one moment, typical wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the indian wife of gable. she has gone to give her baby some water and wham is killed by an arrow instantly. no warning. nada. one of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema. particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western. of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with wellman's total indifference, apparently, to the film. even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.

don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. it was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies i've ever seen. ali g is only funny on channel 4's ali g show. after watching his performance, all i can say is he is not made for movies. with a daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. full of annoying, unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. at the end of the film, ali g gives a speech. he mentions, if you hated this film, tell people it was good. not even the speech could save the movie, he probably knew its gonna be a stinker. i would of given this a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. overall, don't even waste your time on this rubbish.

for those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. garden state tends to be one of those movies. sure, zach braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. people have compared this film to the graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. garden state isn't atrocious, but its isn't great.first off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of large into his former life. after ten years, people tend to act like he never left. where's the awkwardness? of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which i will say was portrayed rather accurately). the film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. however, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like peter saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). it wasn't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.

"garden state" is another of these "indie"-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). where the picture is lacking is in zach braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.when you're as young as braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. in garden state, he plays andrew largeman, a semi-successful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother, who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. he appears to have no feeling about any of this; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old, and has no particular despondency over losing his mother (in fact, he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his, who works as a cemetery grave-digger). it all smacks heavily of "beautiful girls", also about a guy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang with his old friends, with a little "ordinary people" thrown in on the side. it's really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life, given his father and his useless friends (i'm surprised he didn't kill himself), who are still living their "lives" as though they're still in high school, partying with dumb bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the "retarded quarterback" (natalie portman's character, the most aware person in the movie, does), and say things, like "hey, i remember you from junior year". these guys are such losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap forward. even one friend, who made millions inventing a silent velcro, has no real reason to live, because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying. and you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, which keeps from "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, like an adult would. then he meets sam (natalie portman) a sort-of lost girl, who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size. anyway, they fall in love, and braff learns to "feel" again. the clichés come fast and furious. braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game. in one scene, braff and portman are in the millionaire kid's house, playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard movie-schtick, i swear, i half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire. in another, braff visits a doctor (ron liebman) to get his junk refilled, and liebman tells him (in easily the worst line in the movie) "the body can play tricks on you. i once found my ex-best-friend's cufflinks in my wife's purse, and i didn't have an erection for a year and a half." obviously, no licensed physician would ever say that, but it's dirtbag poetry, a nod from braff to, i guess, his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them, just as the "37" joke in "clerks", was kevin smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies. anyway, braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope; the story plays itself out predictably. but if you're going to have a movie that's wall-to-wall clichés, at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it. and braff does. he has the right sort of vacancy, of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out andrew both real and poignant, and natalie portman (also of beautiful girls) gives the movie a big lift. with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood, she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion. jean smart is surprisingly good as portman's mother, and peter saarsgard (though much better in "shattered glass") is notable as the gravedigger friend. i would recommend "garden state" if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies, but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few "f**ks" and "awesomes" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material. it doesn't.

wave after wave of directionless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and mired in cliché-driven dialogue which builds to a crecendo of awfulness and cheese by the end. throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters, who are actually very dull, and just don't quite work and who clunk through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits, driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the whinings of coldplay. the film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, rudimentary humour of the film in general) but by the end, the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out. watch this film at your peril.

bean, kevin & perry, uk tv creations that have made successful transitions onto the big screen. now its ali g's turn and i m afraid to say this is not one of them!ali has always been obscene but funny with it. this film was extremley sick and not funny at all. scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake.ali g in da house is rubbish and deserves making very little money.1 out 10

if i compare two films with sacha cohen, borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better. i'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g.i cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the ali g script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. and a number of jokes including mr cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. ali g overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. but it's ok to watch,it's quite funny.but never ever watch borat, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.

my god how bad this is. who is this impostor pretending to be ali g? avoid this at all costs. it replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo.one commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr sacha baron cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the packaging.terribly disappointing. go seek out the dvd's of innit, aiiii, or bling bling for some real ali g.

ali g was funny at first. his interviews were fresh and original. the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first.but this film is just a rehash of old jokes, the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part. the film claimed good actors like charles dance, but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters. it is not 'terrible' but isn't really funny at all a second time. it could be said that the movie was ali g's last bastion of comedy. after that he ran out of steam.

i have absolutely no idea why i watched ali g indahouse except for the fact that salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating sacha baron cohen for a emmy for his work on da ali g show. it is a sure bet that i will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. comedy? torture was more like it. it was just about the stupidest thing i every watched. i will admit that i was captivated by rhona mitra. i had not seen her in anything. she wasn't on the practice during the time i was watching, so i guess i will have to check out boston legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.

may contain spoilers for about the last four years i've been a keen fan of ali g. sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my view, his best creation is borat who's as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.anyway, to the movie. i didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema; i suppose because i didn't expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently, i found the whole thing pretty sad. the best part of ali's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - really!!?? this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen. the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that i've come to expect from british films. where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to? that said, there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in ali's bed and ali's audience with hm the q with the "shaven haven - respect" remark.so, in summary, i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with anita roddick of the body shop) but this movie fell really flat with me. if there's to be another movie, i hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.weasel100 canberra, australia

this movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! the trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. press releases indicated that shatner and hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). if you like william shatner (i do) see "free enterprise" instead.

ok, a film about a film that takes a crack at video movie making could be entertaining. could be, should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet... this film is the bizzaro negative version of that. hamlin was entertaining as a 'b' film producer. shatner played crazy yet likable, and had all the best lines. the rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. the production value was lame. you'll actually see the boom come down in one scene. the sound was awful in some of the scenes. hey i'm a big fan of shatner's and of hamlin now, but their talents are wasted here. at least the story had a clichéd ending.

really bad italian horror movie, a sort of remake of hammer infamous frankenstein must be destroyed, this time with a lady frankenstein taking over the business from father. a few nudes, several botched bits of dialogue, no tension at all. forgettable

although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv, i found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time round, buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces (including a bemused joseph cotten as the baron) and, contrary to many another film of the euro-cult sub-genre, an incident-packed plot in place of lethargic pacing.the creature itself looks a bit dodgy and cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life-forms out of corpses (one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still) but ms. neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable herbert fux probably comes off best as a lecherous grave-robber/blackmailer.

okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film. a sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor (joseph cotten) whoring himself out for a buck. mr. cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap. the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews, who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead. i know mr. andrews was in the throes of alcoholism, but why did cotten do this mess?!as for the plot, it's a reworking of the frankenstein plot. the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story. then, inexplicably, they introduced a daughter. this wasn't a bad thing,...until then, out of the blue, they decided to stop making a horror film but make a soft-core pornographic flick!! the change was dramatic and bizarre. it was almost as if they said "okay, mr. cotten is done with his scenes and has gone home,....now ladies,...strip!".the problem is that on every level, the film is just awful except for the monster's makeup. while not great, it is still pretty cool to see. but bad writing, acting and a budget of $17.46 conspired to make this a drab and awful flick--one so bad that tossing in some nudity for the pervs out there shouldn't be enough to entice anyone to see it.

a true gothic horror trash classic!uhm, actually, it's a horrible movie. best thing about it: rosalba neri's erected naked nipples. intensely suckable material.oh sure, rosalba neri is one fine lady. never even heard of her before this flick, but she is a damn fine looking lady. but honestly, it were her nipples that did it for me, in that very last scene, before the movie abruptly ends, all naked and erected... total dream-nipples, man. okay, sorry, getting a little carried away here...basically, i got what i expected from lady frankenstein: it's a sleazy and horrible flick with a big stupid, ugly-looking frankenstein monster and a couple of naked tits. and it's got a castle in it. so i wasn't really disappointed or anything. it just dragged too much in certain places (the first resurrection of the creature kept on going for ages, with daddy frankenstein just experimenting, talking, trying some more). there was one fun, imbecilic homage to the original frankenstein, though: instead of throwing a little girl into a lake, here mongoloid franky picked up a naked chick and threw her in a river. had me laughing.some friends of mine raved just a tad bit too much about this flick, though. had me maybe expecting a bit too much. but rosalba's erected nipples sure were worth it... (aw crap, i really need to stop mentioning her nipples). i think i'll just end this user-comment now.

wow. just wow. never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes. and then i happened to come upon "lady frankenstein". this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down... and not in a good way. if you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv, or you have the dubbed version on the 50 chilling classics box set like i have, as number 24. and lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here. because they're not very good. enough of that though, onto the movie.it starts out with dr. frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who's....obviously not igor for some reason. his college graduate daughter (?) shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree, cause yeah. there were so many female doctors back then. so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no. and then he makes the monster and it kills him. so she grieves for exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar. the monster escapes and goes on a rampage. ok, i really can't believe they killed dr. frankenstein so early in the movie. he dies like...20 minutes in. and then his daughter takes over. which.... doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but sure. so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster who's now rampaging....is to make another monster! oh yes how i love her logic. so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in it...i know. just nod and go along with it. so the monsters meet and duke it out. i love how the assistant asks "why don't we just let the mobs kill it?" and she answers with "they wouldn't know how to kill it!" and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head. haha. oh yeah, nobody else could have figured that one out. so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein. the end.this movie was just....weird. it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic. there's no other way to describe this movie. there were some odd naked scenes too. like, this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away. haha. nice guy. she then struggles a bit and dies from.....to be quite honest, i really don't know what she died from. but whatever. it's lady frankenstein. it doesn't have to make sense. this movie had a lot of those "why?" moments to the point that i just gave up. movies shouldn't do that, but for some reason i see that more than i probably should. so final word, it's not the worst movie i've seen on this pack, but it's a tad boring, and full of many many holes and random things. so lady frankenstein gets 3 frankenstein porn scenes, out of 10

last night i got to see an early preview screener of prozac nation. because i love everything that christina ricci does i was very excited at first, but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going. based on a true story, it is simply about christina ricci's character and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family as you can probably tell from the title. in my opinion this movie moved too fast, and it was way too dramatic. i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie moved through her life extremely fast, and this left no room for us to connect with christina ricci's character. christina ricci's performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie, and i believe this movie's success will be all because of her and christina ricci. i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out.

if you're coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. i understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character i've ever seen in a hollywood feature... no small feat. christina ricci as elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end). there is not the slightest hint of what she might be like without depression... not the faintest glimmer of any other aspects of her personality... she just screams. at one point, her roommate tells her, "lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around when you're not being depressed," and my reaction was, "she is?" it seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. it has no discernible structure or flow at all; instead, it consists of a series of awkwardly strung-together scenes of lizzie screaming, then ends. character development? no... scenes of her everyday existence, i.e. going to classes, that might possibly be important details? no... screaming at maximum volume? check. it's not quite enough, i'm afraid. 1/10.

i suppose that to say this is an all-out terrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. the sub-disney storyline involves dogs playing soccer and falling in love (aw, how cute!) the acting isn't bad, but definitely could be better, especially that of young canadian actor kevin zegers, who, during the whole movie, looks embarrassed, like he doesn't even want to be there. anyway, kids will love it, but parents beware!

at least if you're a disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, air bud: world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch. i'm a disney fanatic. i enjoyed this film enough, and i'll gladly watch it again.but boy does it have a lot of problems. the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters, too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all. in the space of 82 minutes, we've got adults getting married, teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it, teen competition for love and jealousy, preteens playing spy games, dogs falling in love, dogs playing soccer, dogs having puppies, manipulative parents who'll do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids, housekeeper dilemmas, and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots. i'm probably forgetting something, but that's 10 big plot issues to be dealt with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that's both not too complicated--this is a kids' film, after all--and that's also humorous and heartwarming. not surprisingly, director bill bannerman, on his first turn being completely in charge (he has a lot of previous second unit experience), wasn't quite up to the task. i'm sure it didn't help that there were at least three screenwriters involved, and probably dictating producers, as well.the end result is that air bud: world pup is extremely choppy. events occur with little justification, and worse, often little explanation. people figure out and do things primarily because they need to--and fast--so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes. from one cut to the next, time might jump ahead six months or so. we have both adults who seem like maybe they're mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action. some of the threads should have simply been removed, because it's difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you're introduced to an idea, it's already passed you by.also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a rip-off of one hundred and one dalmatians (1961), minus a cruella de vil character. and another problem is that given the way the film is edited, i have to assume that the dog, air bud, probably couldn't do much with the soccer ball. unlike the first two films, a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see him, it's in very quick glimpses; every once in a while, these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation.yet, for someone like me, there's a cheesy charm to air bud: world pup. the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous, hokey and kinda clichéd. i tend to like that combination. it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. and at times, like the ending, when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the u.s. women's soccer team, air bud: world pup is so blatantly tacky that you can't help but love it.

i'm a big fan of h. p. lovecraft's books, and the mythos background spawned some rather good other stories and stuff like that. and in the last years there came along some boys who did movies about h. p.'s work,  for the bigger part low-budged flicks  and showed them to the public at places like the h. p. lovecraft film festival. now, like i said, most of them don't have a big budged, but they at least know the heart and "soul" of lovecrafts work and films like "cool air" or "the call of cthulhu" - are what i would think - gifts for the fan base and other loonies that like h.p.'s creation. and then there are people like ivan zuccon, who just rip off the name and create a movie which would have been fun to watch if i had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down at the beach. that is what mr. zuccon did as it seems...but, while blokes like aaron vanek's or bryan moore's earlier movies might not have had more budged, they somehow still had more to offer , like a story, real characters and some connection to lovecraft! just blabbering out names like "nyarlathotep" or "necronomicon" makes a movie not a lovecraft-adaption. anyway, this flick will not only make fans of the mythos shudder and hide, it will also not appeal to people who 1. like good movies, 2. laugh about bad movies, 3. like good c-grade splatter movies or 4. watch everything that has horror written on the dvd-cover. i will not go into the "plott" of this waste of time, as it has already been discussed by others here on this page, but like i said, unknown beyond is like a movie i would have made up with some geeky friends.. aside from that it lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous "moronic-nonsense-but-he-it's-art-stuff". self-made flicks of this "quality" are fun to watch if you know all the blokes in it and ha-ha, see how xy is coughing out the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff  but hey, you don't put this in a dvd-casing, declare it an actual movie and want money for iti give it 2/10 because of the i dunno  effort or something like that

i'm sort of between the gushy review and the hate review. i've been a fan of lovecraft (and a lovecraft 'purist') for a long time, and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities. i went into viewing expecting the worst thing i've ever seen, and wondering if lovecraft would turn in his grave over it, but i was shocked to find that i actually kind of liked it.i don't want to catalog the movie's faults, so i'll only mention a few that keep this movie from being a 'stellar amateur effort'.it's very low budget and shot on a video cam, so it has the look of some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea then it ceases to be a big deal. the direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy. still, this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to lovecraftian intent than nearly all the stuart gordan and brian yuzna travesties (my main exception to those films being re-animator and dagon) put together. the idea of being impregnated by some old one is reminiscent of dunwich horror and shadow over innsmouth (which isn't to say this movie is as good as those stories!!), so the overall plot is quite faithful to lovecraft's ideas. one thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid. i'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that 'god's' words upset the old ones or just this particular zombie. there was no real answer to that. the rest of the christian symbolism in it reminds me of august derleth's take on the mythos. so in a way this was a derleth style take on the mythos.i would recommend this film only as a curiosity. it shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget. i liked the setting of the wine cellars. the outdoor shots were sad, though. using the same stretch of beach and trees (and nearly the same damn shot) to convey 3 characters' long journey was really sad. the director needs whack upside the head for that. the acting was standard for an amateur film, with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for "best impersonation of gollum by an italian actress". actually i think this film was done prior to the lord of the rings movies. maybe andy sedaris watched her and thought "dang, she'd make a great gollum!" one little kudo to the director, though. the makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids. i was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching. i was like "oh so that's how we know she's evil and possessed", but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman (both living). so it wasn't an attempt to say 'goth makeup = zombie' but rather, 'goth makeup was left on after zombification'. however, possessed/zombie does equal 'blue contact lenses'...heh.on the whole, i still liked this movie better than the yuzna and gordan films (barring the aforementioned exceptions). yuzna and gordan had much better budgets, but this film did a better job at filming a lovecraft-like story than they did, and on a tiny budget.one quick word to the the make-up artist: i know you wanted 'claws' or something on zariah's fingers, but long, black press-on nails looked really silly.a quick word to the writer of the score: i know you couldn't resist, and apparently neither could the director who okayed it, but when the two characters square off with guns for a 'duel', playing that little whistle from "the good, the bad, and the ugly" killed any mood that scene had accumulated. it was cute, but cute wasn't appropriate.the filmmakers of this movie have read lovecraft and had a great deal of respect for him. i enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character carter with the bad dreams, and the character pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.

it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame. and it's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this. i rented this "movie" cuz of the drop "h.p. lovecraft" on it. and i'm a big fan of many of his adaptions, mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver! a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine-cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" over the whole movie. no actors, just some stupid low-grade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing, stiff as wood. and so must be the director. it's obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere. but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesn't work. and no gore-effects, just some blood in a river (you drink = you become demon) and dropping here and there. oh yeah, the story: thousands of years ago some "big old" colonised the world and took humans as slaves. then mankind got independent, so the "old ones" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon, that's where it gets to lovecraft. so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine-cellar. unbelievable - the whole thing! but as it is dubbed (german title: "armee des jenseits) and you can find it in most commercial video-stores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that. i find this fact impressive.

as i was watching it, i was getting ready to compose a blasting, lambasting critique of this "film," (it is actually video), but then i saw that someone already did. i pretty much agree with him. but then again, it looks like a lot of effort and millions of lira went into it, so i guess you gotta give them some credit for trying. however, that being said, anyone who doesn't already know the lovecraftian world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think, ... well, i suppose, that not only is it really bad, but it makes absolutely no sense. thank god i read part of the other review ('twas a little gushy, maybe?) which revealed that this guy also did "the shunned house," (which looked pretty bad, judging by the dvd box), so now i can avoid it and save my mind from any further exposure to such desecration of the brilliance of h.p. lovecraft.

this really is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life (i'm approaching 47)! the description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. the further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their "acting". i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! the location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. i suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard. the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning. as were the actors faces. which brings me to the topic "make-up": by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teen-ager's magazines "my first own make-up" or similar. what made me buy the dvd was the name "lovecraft" printed on the cover. the only connection with this brilliant mind's works was the use of the name "necronomicon", which was wrongly translated as "book of light". the 4,70 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss, for the dvd went into the recycling box without any further ado.

maybe we aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. i have a database of all the dvds i own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, i always refer to imdb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. when entering this, i noted that it was a comedy and so i decided to watch it at a time when i wanted something light and a good laugh. well, it was neither! there were absolutely no laughs at all and an inordinate amount of gratuitous profanity (are there really radio announcers allowed to broadcast the sort of filth that steve jones dishes out? what if a decent child happened to tune to his station?).rather than enjoy a good laugh (or even a little giggle) i found the whole thing thoroughly depressing. i have given it 3 out of 10 but, to be honest, i don't know what those 3 are for! i suppose the basics of lighting and sound weren't too bad! we have an ostensibly stone-broke loser (giovanni ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for the fuel?) and live in what could be a nice apartment (who pays his rent?) given the opportunity of forming what might have been some sort of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl, he even blew that! perhaps it was she (lynn collins) who earned this movie the 3 points! the fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense ("i make as much in one night doing this as i do in two weeks' hairdressing").unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth, forget it!

this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen. it just wasn't funny. my wife fell asleep. i suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. if you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an english radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. the strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom. what did happen in the strip club made no sense at all. there was a great deal of mumbling by the lead character with whom i developed no sympathy at all. mena suvari was hardly in the film, presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film. the bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep.

i realize the line on my summary is not too polite.this film written & directed by scott caan & starring giovanni ribisi,don cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.there is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.the movie opened in 2 u.s. theatres in late april 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. it quickly went to dvd in early august 2007.we were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the dvd off.this was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill. you saw the main film & figured lets see what this one is like, you might have walked out before we shut it off.the 3 actors & the young ladies in the film all have done & deserve better than this..ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) imdb 4 (out of 10_

let me start by saying i don't recall laughing once during this comedy. from the opening scene, our protagonist solo (giovanni ribisi) shows himself to be a self-absorbed, feeble, and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word, or forming a coherent thought. i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression. i guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature. i didn't get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character, which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days. no spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self- absorbed, self-pitying lowlife. i didn't develop any connection with this character. he didn't seem to care, and so neither did i. i actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point.the dog was not a character in the film. it was simply a prop to be used, neglected, scorned, abused, coveted and disposed of on a whim. so be warned. even though "dog" is in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers.scott caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend/cad. don cheadle is sincere and magnetic - i always want to see more of him on screen. mena suvari was delightfully repellent. lynn collins role of a "stripper with a heart" was well acted, but the character was simultaneously absurd and clichéd, not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and ribisi.romantic? hardly. comedy? if you say so.

this movie looked fun on the cover and i honestly thought 'how bad can this be?' little did i know. out of the gate the dialogue was unbearable. it was contrived, unrealistic and not even interesting. dialogue on upn syndicated television shows is more natural sounding. the story was implausible and had nearly zero play-off at the end. the end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. the only remotely interesting character is rose mcgowen's, who is mute which prevents her from being ruined with cliche ridden garbage dialogue (well, at least until the end when even she has to speak). the only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is rose mcgowen's nude scene. truly awful. save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a barney video.

a bad quentin tarantino rip off, at least i hope that's what they were going for because at least then i could respect the director for admiring tarantino. one scene a "singing" scene with rose mcgowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. so besides his quinton inspiration and rose mcgowan and her one good scene this film sucked. some of the crappiest dialogue i have ever heard, i'm willing to bet why mcgowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been. tries to be funny, never is, tries to be dark and isn't, tries to be stylish and is just bland. who dishes out the money to make movies like this, i'm hoping it was all the directors so no one else's money was wasted. if not for mcgowan the whole cast is awful and when mcgowan is your best hmmm, i gotta wonder.

the two most noteworthy things about "i won't play" are: it won an academy award as the best two-reel short film of 1944; and it was directed by silent-era leading man crane wilbur. the plot of this run-of-the-mill short is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks spark, while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most war-themed hollywood movies of the 1940s (in other words, it's awful). admittedly, there are moments when "i won't play" is funny -- janis paige's totally artificial look and line delivery are precious -- but one laughs at the picture, not with it.

firstly, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. thirdly, few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm. fourthly, once a second member of a college small-group project team meets a violent demise, the college president will disband the whole class, and not turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths. since the supernatural elements of cult make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!

cult starts 20 years ago on the 'quinling mountain range, southern china' as a guy called owen quinlin (robert berson) finds an ancient amulet said to have magical powers, cut to california where quinlin has set up a cult & the members are about to sacrifice themselves when one of them (cazzy golomb) foils his evil scheme... jump forward to the present day as five college students, mindy (rachel miner), cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) & morgan (victoria venegas) are researching the events of twenty years ago that have become know as the 'quinling massacre' for a school project. unfortunately morgan decides to kill herself which unleashes the evil spirit of owen quinlin for reasons that are rather tenuous, he sets about completing what he started all those years ago by claiming souls so he can finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil use...edited, co-produced & directed by joe knee this is not a good film & that's being kind to it. the script by benjamin oren which seems to take itself very seriously is a dour supernatural tale about a cult leader who comes back from the dead to finish what he started a few years prior, as you would expect the character's involved now have links to what happened all those years ago & it's as dull as it sounds. the character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue just as much so, there's no proper horror or exploitation in it, it's slow going at times, it's predictable, it's clichéd, it goes completely off the rails at the end & doesn't make much sense when you think about it. the story never grips or engages you, it's never exciting or particularly interesting & i'd struggle to even call it average. there is very little here by which i could recommend cult, don't bother with this one.director knee does alright but the film has that bland shot-on-video made-for-tv look about it, it's utterly forgettable & flat stuff throughout. there's no scares, there's no atmosphere & it lacks any tension. there is no gore either, sure there's a fair amount of blood splatter but no proper actual special make-up effect gore scenes.with a supposed budget of about $950,000 cult looks cheap although it's not as badly made as some low budget horror films i've seen recently. the acting isn't even worth mentioning.cult is a poor film that didn't do anything for me, i'd struggle to call this average. there are much better horror films out there.

while studying the differences between religion and cult in college, mindy (rachel miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) and morgan (victoria venegas) to research the massacre of worshipers of kwan yin by their leader owen quinlin (robert berson) twenty years ago in california. quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed. however, after the death of morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet.the storyline of 'cult" is not totally bad. unfortunately, the screenplay, the direction, the acting, the lines, the camera, the cgi and the edition are awful. i was completely bored and tempted to use the ff button of the dvd, but i resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never-ending crap on a saturday night. my vote is two.title (brazil): "o amuleto secreto" ("the secret charm")

this film is a nightmare! the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same i got when i finished watching this movie: "uffok, it ended, what a relief!" i felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! it's a b-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but i think it not an excuse to be so bad! i've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! this one got nothing of it! the plot is hilarious, it almost seems like an "american guide about how to transform ancient chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, with some kids playing with the occult" i don't know if the chinese tale present in this movie is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! the production is just horrible, a plain zero (what "special effects" are those?). there's no suspense. the supposed "tension scenes" are a complete failure. the acting is not better; and what about the dialogs? oh my god! a movie which has for several times dialogs just like: "i will pass there later, ok? is that alright?  ok, alright. - ok?  ok, alright, bye then" i'm sure it doesn't deserve more than a 1/10 score!too bad to be true!

i can't seem to find anything that is good about this miniseries. why the hell would you ban chocolate when u could ban something far more practical like smoking or alcohol? also the fact that its an australian program and its all set in england and everyone is faking british accents is stupid. overall i think that this show is unrealistic and cheap.

this movie was so bad if anyone out their who starred in the movie are reading this including the director,i hate you! lol,that blonde woman, who was running away screaming through the forest.at least cry rather than scream and keep doing the dodgy heavy breathing!! and oh dear god, if it was the director who sorted out the cameras on this one, then go back to a normal job. no one wants to be watching some scared woman's chin throughout it.damn, don't even think about renting/buying or even having a copy of this within 100 metre radius of your house since it can be harmful to,people who like good movies...when i got home, i thought id rented a pron movie by the acting and style of the camera.

that's all i can really say about this film. it's dbz...like tree of might and the world's strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the tv series. the action is pretty nice in general. the plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. pretty good in general, there... the problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. i mean, really weird stuff. like the world's strongest, there's a really, really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced haze...disturbing is the fact that gohan, while singing, is pretty much drugged out himself. creepy. the villains are odd and rather comical...moreso than the usual dbz type--this seems more like it was made as a dragon ball movie rather than a dragon ball z movie. in general, its entertaining enough, but...just...strange.

i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games hosted by my city.knowing that it is an american film, i had already expected it to focus more on the american athletes story.and i was really ready for it. but what i saw was..., too much!i mean, when a movie has such a title ("first olympics: athens 1896"), even being of american origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and, on the same time, ignorant towards other countries' athletes and efforts.the american athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, smartness, generosity, kindness, politeness...), in contrast to their "sin-athletes" in the games, who seem being unable even to... speak their thoughts or express feelings.the number of times the american anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography.megalomania at it's best!it even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the greek nation, such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon athletes with wine, in order to help the domestic ones win the race.so much for the olympic spirit.think of it.being a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all.but according to what i have seen, i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 (being pretty generous actually).

historically awful. scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. one cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. as with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown. from the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the la olympics.

**spoilers** with the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters. instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the piranahs. even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten, whole and alive, by the fish.the movie "piranha piranha" starts with this scary looking piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but****spoiler****that's the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a piranha is the movie again. what you do see is a travelogue of venezuela and it's people and the venezuelan jungle along the amazon river basin. together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but that's about all.there is some kind of a story that has to do with this great white hunter caribe, william smith, which ironically means piranha in the native language spoken there, is this what the title of the film "piranha piranha" really meant? "caribe caribe"! the person caribe is played by legendary hollywood hell's angles biker and all around tough guy william smith.at the beginning of the movie this trio of american tourists jim pendrake and his sister terry, peter bown & ahna capri, and their american guide art green, tom simcox, are on their way into the venezuelan jungles to go sight-seeing with terry taking photos to send back home. terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun. even when art saves her life using one when see's attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake terry almost belts him for having a gun; which he promised her he wouldn't take along with him on the trip.at a jungle rest stop, or bar, the three run into caribe who we first saw catching monkey's in the jungle at the start of the movie. caribe makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the amazon basin.even though a bit strange at first, the guy is so in to himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are any people around him, caribe turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with art. caribe even shows terry, who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out, the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes don't really die but become a part of him after he kills them! a bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination. it's much later in the movie that for some strange reason, maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking, caribe suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly piranha's. trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty-fighting caribe that he's almost left unconscious. just when caribe's about to finally kill art he's shot to death by terry who after experiencing what this insane nut-job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life-saving occasions.worth watching, if worth watching at all, only for the scenery and nothing else. it's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish, or piranha, horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with smith, he does have the build for it, playing tarzan of the venezuelan, not african, jungle

this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly.. i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films, but this one bugged me.why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap, its getting to be one dimensional. the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this : thumb sucker kids bully allthose i think are better so i recommend one of those is you'd like to see a good "teen movie" i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me

this movie was outright painful for me to watch. i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. first off, jump cuts. there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. secondly, the dialog. i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films. since this film is very specific to its location, the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also (example: set a movie in boston, yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent). even with understanding this, it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present. these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film. there were a few others. i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing. i have years of experience in the film (more importantly the low budget indie film) industry. i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness. i have been unable to discover this method used in this film. this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making, or just another low budget, poorly put together film. i honestly hope that it is not the latter. if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way, or has any thoughts/views of their own concerning this film, i would love to hear them. hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed.

i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater. despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of eddie polec in 1994), i really have to come down hard on this movie. the director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film. a stroll down the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style, distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama. martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse...did i miss anything? no doubt a better cast (and a better-focused direction) would have knit these threads together, as martin surely intended, to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others...but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make. just a sprawling mess. martin, i know you're from my town, and i'm down with you man, i really am...just do a better job next time, like you did in two plus one.

this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it. this was a mistake. i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck, terrible, horrible, but somehow you just can't look away. shaudenfraud i guess! ; ).this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean. one by one they are all murdered. one drinks cleaning fluid, one gets blown up on a waverunner, one goes over a cliff...so these are not accidents, but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should "wrap" the shoot and go home, not just in respect for the dead, but perhaps out of fear for their own lives. no. they just continue with their shoot because that is what's most important. forget about the dead models, we have a magazine to produce!one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner, played by lee majors, rex is his name. he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says "well, i can't say this won't be good for sales", mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha". so absurd. another subplot is when it's revealed that rex is one of the models baby dady, only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort. she didn't, but always resented him for even suggesting this.they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named raule, seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and "looks creepy".at the very end (sorry to spoil, but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now...) one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. this was the last straw!!!! vanessa angel, forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun, they struggle, the gun fires and now she's dead too!!! while she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault. he gets him to sign over the magazine to him. once he does voila! all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rex.oy! what a ridiculous movie. as someone else said; if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better!

so you've got a number of models on an island, and one by one they're picked off agatha christie-style. we get somebody lost at sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, driven off a cliff, blown up, etc. nothing terribly graphic.before any of that starts, one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask.the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair, and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age.in the end, it's all about business, or something,there's an 80s style montage of a photo shoot, most of the bathing suits being one-pieces, surprisingly. a couple are fairly translucent. there's camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture. the photographer is rather bad at framing!

"terror in the aisles" might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has, in fact, very few to offer. granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) selection of horror/thriller fragments that are considered classic but ...what's the point? this documentary primarily aims for the horror-loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already, haven't we? the only thing really praiseworthy about this project is the editing. if you're into scream-queens, chases by vile murderers and that sort of things, "terror in the aisles" has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences. all these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring donald pleasance and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater. in between two sequences, the address the viewer and "explain" why we love horror so much. those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ...bla bla bla) and i fail to understand why many people love the concept. this is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing. on the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing. the main reason why i overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known, but fundamental (foreign) titles endlessly focusing on "halloween". this does result in a cool inside joke, however, when donald pleasance screams to the screen at his own character.

i used to think that "it came from hollywood" was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror, sci-fi, crime and drama movies. of course, i hadn't seen this beauty yet.what's wrong with "terror in the aisles"? four things:1) it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the '70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along. and what bones are thrown to the true classics (i.e. - the black and white films) like "frankenstein", "dracula" and "the wolf man" are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at all!2) the clips are most times so brief and out of their originals' place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and, for those unfamiliar with these films, will make no sense at all (indeed, the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in "jaws" is shown much to the effect of a sight gag. whereas, in the original's context, it had power.)3) did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that "it's only a movie" or that most of the violence in the horror movies "is, sadly, against women"? so, is that an indictment against the movie-makers for adding those scenes or the movie-goers who tromp into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again? sorry, that's a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie.4) and most importantly, why is the movie so short? it isn't like there wasn't enough of these kinds of movies to use. if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film, they could have had a "that's entertainment!"-style movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining. heck, even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing (cushing was alive then, mind you) and better yet, even vincent price would have been more than willing, i'll bet! what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience!but no... all we're left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie. don't get me wrong; it was good to see what clips they did show, but if they could have just done more with the goods!two stars. another good idea left laying "in the aisles".

pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald pleasance and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious ("movie horror helps us deal with real horror", "you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre") and pretty trite. also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring. and, shown out of context, these bits aren't very scary at all. and it's real short--i saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that i paid $5.00 for an 84 minute movie!still, it is reasonably well-edited and allen and pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves. for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting. but if you're a horror fan (like me) you'll probably be bored silly. good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). i give it a 3.

if this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the wga, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang up the word processor. astonishingly inept writing, direction, production, at every level, even for a tv movie. no cliche goes unexploited in this jaw-droppingly bad movie. what were they thinking? does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this?

maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that "cranked out" is written all over this production. obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. there is some talent among the cast, but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent. the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter, but will friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character, though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his "boy meets world" role. the background for this movie is washington, d.c. and the white house, but there is no real "presidential" feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty. the disney channel presents a lot of original tv-movies and most of them are better than this.

this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. this is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts. this movie is good for someone young...although come to think of it, i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion. the movie was really predictable. i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. i think it was appropriate for the whole family but hallie's dress was a bit unmodest but certainly appropriate enough for family material.

five fingers is so bad, that i hardly know where to begin. so let me admit first, that i have only seen the first half hour. when the first finger had been chopped off, i thought sleeping a more useful activity. i told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example.couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? like me? they should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. this major goof makes the mental pressure put on martijn just a laugh. how, when and why did martijn date a moroccan girlfriend? such an affair is very rare in the netherlands.calling me a retard is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average iq. moreover, as far as i know, retards don't play chess. i do.the biggest problem is the script of course. just compare the little intelligent movie hard candy. to keep the spectator in a grip, the information must be revealed bit by bit. a nice twist now and then also helps. i understood from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the movie. any smart person can guess what it is. this of course just raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? oh my, why should i even care? the whole movie focuses on just one thing: the chopped fingers. the makers have not even learned hitchcock's lesson: it is thrilling to get a bomb exploded. it is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking. but no, we don't see the paper-cutter until the impossible countdown is over. i will not waste more words on this crap. go see hard candy.

boring movie. poor plot. poor actors. the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco but actually in some american city! the "arab terrorists" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the "arab terrorist"...damn!there is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are americans (or western people if you like).the movie is divided into two parts. the first part of the movie concerns the dutchman travel (15 seconds) while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something).the dutch guy is going to deliver money in morocco to some "charity organization", gets off the plain, takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling "they will not shoot at us". the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a morpheus-like arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too! at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for!good when you are so tired you can't sleep.

i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, i still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. we have similar people in the united states and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. think of the puritans,and the christian crusades against the islamic people during the medieval times. lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion. i do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. but still do remember the majority of the islamic people are peaceful! people of any nation feel some sort of patriotism but to start a war on the fact that i'm right and your wrong needs to be rethought. again i repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them.

forget what i said about emeril. rachael ray is the most irritating personality on the food network and all of television. if you've never seen 30 minute meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. i really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. the problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot. if you love something or think it's "awesome" (a word she uses roughly 87 times per telecast) just say it. and she's constantly using horrible, unfunny catchphrases like "evoo" (extra virgin olive oil!). shut up! what's worse is ray has two other shows on the network! i think this is some elaborate conspiracy by the terrorists to drive us mad. give me more tyler florence! ray is lame.

i watched this cooking show for a few times before i wanted to pull my hair out. just one question.....who can't cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. also, almost every cooking show on tv is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for sandra lee), during their show. oh and yep....they do full meals too.love the comment by the guy who hated the "evoo" comment. add "de-lish" to my list of stupid tag words. then you have the obvious....a loud, gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience. she laughs at her own lame comments, mugs too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks. no she ain't "the cutest thing." she's a 40-something year old woman who isn't de-lish.

i give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line. without going into too much detail.the acting in this movie is terrible. really terrible - wooden, shallow.the graffiti on show is weak, so bloody weak that i can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all. it was obvious in the spraying scenes that they'd gotten other people in to do the 'work'. they might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few cents.i would avoid this film at all costs.the kid loco soundtrack used to be something i listened to on my ipod, its going to be a while before i can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mind.avoid at all costs. unless you are thinking to yourself "wow, its been a while since i've seen a really sh*t movie...."

i enjoy gay-themed movies where the characters aren't stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me to this movie, that and the principal actor, which is the only reason i'm giving this movie one more star than it deserves (although not because of his acting in the film, let me tell you). a lot of people complain about the cinematography, but the camcorder feel of the movie added a certain "underground" quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would make any movie screen blush.but the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (i got through the latter half of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another film), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialog and then it is awkward and amateur. the subject of graffiti could have made this movie great had it been gracefully exploited and had the art itself been more intriguing, but it isn't.worst of all, there is no climax; there wasn't really a plot to begin with. the movie just crawls back into its shell of silence and dies. a forgettable movie.

i remember this movie with feelings of sheer . . . agony. more than half of the film is commercials (no, really!). the slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost is!) the end result is a prefab love story of predictable schlock, all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary debbie boone hit. yep, that's how fast it was produced... the song that "inspired" it was still big on the charts when the film was released!despite decades of seeing bad movies, this one still impresses me for its extravagant, no-holds-barred, headlong jump into the most tedious, absurd, and indelible cinematic badness. it truly deserves to be on the imdb list of the 100 worst of all time, and has never left the top 3 on my personal "worst" list. enjoy it for the sheer masochistic thrill!

debbie boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "you light up my life;" the didi conn film of the same name, however, was a horrifically embarrassing flop. conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with michael zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. they are engaged, but every one knows that zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only didi is surprised when he dumps her. needless to say, didi is quite embarrassed.fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. she calls it--can you guess?--"you light up my life." she hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. now, i recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "well thank heavens, we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. now maybe something interesting will happen." and something interesting did happen. the credits rolled.yep, that was it. not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. this movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. we're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. if you liked the debbie boone song by all means buy a copy of it. but don't waste your time or money on this flick. this is one movie you'll be glad you missed.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: sam raimi didn't direct it. although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. it's too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. i don't think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the pang brothers.the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other "horror" films, so you'll find absolutely zero original content in "the messengers." what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of "pulse," a couple that could have come from "the birds," one or two from "the others," etc. nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the "surprise ending" long before it comes.right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. in fact, everyone can see the ghosts. the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. i'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. now you know, so don't be fooled! perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. it simply isn't there. all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling "boo!" all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. if there's any message that "the messengers" delivers, it's "don't waste your time on this movie."

this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. few movies can actually give me chill bumps. this one did. few horror movie give me a sense of dread. this one did. it kept me guessing. i cared about the story. i cared about the characters. the acting was decent. unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. it becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. it does. what builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd. a plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters. the story concludes with disappointment. while this movie seems complete, there is one loose end that could setup for a sequel. the movie isn't good enough for a sequel. this movie is worth seeing in the theater, just don't expect to be stunned. this is best suited as a movie to rent. it's probably not a movie you'd want to own.

i don't usually like to comment on the acting in a movie, because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after. in this movie, i will make an exception. the acting in this film are below average all around. i mean halfway into the film, i wonder how the hell did the producer and/or the director gets around casting such an ensemble of people who can't act. even-though the production value was good, the ill written story just compounded on top of the bad performance of the actors, and there is even a half-hearted attempts to a twist to the ending of the movie, which ends up quite confusing. is all the spanish horror films this disappointing?

this week's surprise screening at gv turned out to be the horror movie the nun (la monja). seriously, i think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like the monk, the priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.the basic premise goes very simply, that a ghoul dressed up in a nun garb (so that it can lay claim to the title) goes around killing ex-convent girls. there seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved, as the daughter of one of the victims, eva (played by an eye candy icelandic anita briem), goes on to discover, with the help of a few good friends, like a rip off of i know what you did last summer (mentioned also, by the way).so as the body count increases, it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred (aren't they always?) heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. delving into the sins of the mothers, the movie did the unthinkable, that with a dream sequence as the introduction. i hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly, and there are a couple of them in the movie.in part, the movie played at times like ju-on gone wrong with the plenty of dark water references, and they could have retitled this unholy water, for the circumstances and plot points in the movie. however, there are plot holes abound, so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply. you'd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun, and sets which look like they can rival recent thai horror movie dorm.the acting's pretty forgettable, with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented english. and since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witch-hunt. what gives? hello, got hantu, still got mood ah? then again, the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated/sfx which has a built in ai of popping up every now and then, in various fashion, just to elicit screams from timid audiences. the characters also break every unwritten rule in the do-nots in horror lore, so you know and expect their just desserts.can you possibly enjoy this movie? sure you can. just ensure that you're watching it in a full house (should be easy, since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific), and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every "frightening" scene. it's pretty fun, and adds to the atmosphere, besides what's going on the screen. surround sound doesn't even come close.think of it as watching an episode of scooby doo without the wisecracks, and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a pg rating. those could possibly have been the best bits, now left rotting on the censor's floor board.

this is a stereotype plot. a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.the fights are not of high standards. they are way too "simple" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. the fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. the coach yells do this and do that with no success. and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. this results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. think about the rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. the fights are also shot poorly.there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment.these guys really could have made some quality entertainment, but the director wasn't up to the task. or the other crew in my opinion. maybe they had a small budget, i don't know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.

this movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book. as written by rafael sabatini, this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the caribbean, and it would have made a grand motion . also, it would have been very simple to make. all the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island. unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. even the name of the main character was changed, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel. it's a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story.

i attended a screening of 'the cooler' at the toronto film festival this year. while the other reviews i've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, i must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. the very brave and candid performances by william h. macy and maria bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clichéd script to have received the green light in years. i don't know how bad the brown bunny was, but i'm certain it couldn't have attained the dante-style depths that this one did. as courageous as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to entrust themselves to such a dreadful director and abysmal screenplay.he must pitch pretty well in the boardroom, because he should never been permitted to be within a hundred yards of a camera. the dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that i actually found myself blushing during the screening. i am mortified that the talents of macy have been totally squandered in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing.watching gifted actors like alec baldwin labor through kramer's appalling script and ham-fisted direction was akin to watching a baby seal get clubbed to death - i felt angered, helpless, and sickened all at the same time. although i am always glad that there are investors and industry-people willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises, this picture was a total, utter fiasco. kramer couldn't have been crueler to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe to their knees. i hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening. regrettably, it seems that the bad luck of main character has rubbed off on the picture in the worst possible way. anyone accustomed to quality independents will likely find it completely unbearable.

admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero (bond) and villain (blofeld) were seriously miscast. lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play bond. he looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. the director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like "royal baluga, north of the ..." just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster. the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father. but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with lazenby only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor. this movie is too long (140 mins.) for a bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until bond's mountain escape, where it begins to pick up. this film tries very hard, but falls short. many bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch, but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one.

a woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. she's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. we also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse. further, even though this is a business arrangement, the first time she's with her sperm donor, she takes off all her clothes, as if it's a seduction. plus, her husband doesn't notice when $30,000 goes missing from their bank accounts. does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most hollywood fare? far fetched on all counts.

i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. apart from his rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. but surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit. the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes."l'étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, ray neglects to say so. i was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in french) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('si belle, cybele') and some portmanteaux.as so often in ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. i'll rate this mess one point out of 10.

i looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. but the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. there is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. i was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!there's only one good thing about this movie. the sound!! the soundtrack is awesome! .............don't expect anything from this movie.

this noisy, dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except william h. macy, who could have tackled the role played by mr. stone, the team doctors, or the "fruitcake" selling cereal. if you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some mtv-styled music video scenes.** any given sunday (12/16/99) oliver stone ~ al pacino, cameron diaz, jamie foxx, dennis quaid

another lame attempt to make a movie "gritty" and "thought provoking"- whatever the hell that means. they have al pacino say a lot of words like - "television killed football." yeah whatever. this is another movie that showcases oliver stone's delusions of grandeur. if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs? he even throws cameron diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. it's a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad.ever since "scent of woman," writers and directors have used pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. his characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite. he needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling. he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "organized football is messed up," and act out a good story.

i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. the acting was over the top. the direction was tacky and amateurish. the script was just a joke. the story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. and why, why did oliver stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? he was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. he could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. then you have jamie foxx, who throws like a girl. but, he is a tad more athletic than the aged dennis quaid. seriously, stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with add. that is why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and numerous edits. it just became a bad mtv video. shame on al pacino for doing this crap. cameron diaz? heck, that no-talent takes any role that comes down the pike. when lawrence taylor is the best "actor" you got going, well, your movie sucks! and this one does.

i just got back from "ags". after seeing it, i'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, stone never has watched an nfl game in his life. great cinematography ? give me a break. the game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. was there anything in this movie that wasn't brought up in "north dallas forty" ?aging star player ... check. young hot shot .... check. painkillers .... check. owner who doesn't "get it" .... check. crazy off-field behavior .... checkalso, it's the playoffs in dallas (i.e dec or jan) in an outdoor stadium, yet people sitting there in tank-tops and shorts ! and what was with those lights ? were they playing in a japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium ?and the strategy shown in the game was laughable. it's fourth & 1 inside the "sharks'" 30. dallas leads 35-31. kick the frigging field goal. not only would this had made sense football-wise, but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two-point conversion. hell, tie the game w/ the extra point and stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime.were the lame montages of "old time" football players supposed to be a tribute to the game ? give me a break.and the script ... ugh. more cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there's another one."slapshot" was better than this movie. by far.1/10.skips this at all costs.

beautiful images, propaganda and history as toy. the ingredients of this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. politicall shadows. jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical america. he is silhouette of a vision about life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of large part of north america. in film is only superman. the delicate contour of ideas are crushed. the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. and jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of american realities. the end,triumphal and fake, romance and heroic, is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom. and the war against "avatar" is another gray stain. for one who heard nothing about jefferson, movie is a good beginning. for the others - disillusion. it is like the precious silk of a tailor. but the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are only ordinary cloth. so, a sad experience. slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation. a film who must impressive. and the ash of a story who could be magnificent.

when i first watched this film, i thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. he gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. he is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and american dream-working class hero trash (which i'm not). i don't get it. how can this film get away with being so naf. that bit with the little boy being rescued, i mean, come on! you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire-guy wearing any goggles (i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you) and no breathing equipment (he'd have choked after 2 minutes!). this film was just bad, ok?why robert? whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????!!!!sorry if this is your favourite film.

the man who gave us splash, cocoon and parenthood gave us this incoherent muddle of cliched characters, poor plotting, you've-got-to-be-kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting? i guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then. he's allowed.

the basic plot is good and can be engaging. the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef (though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie). so, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. and the dialog?! what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? you get much greater realism from most cartoons! the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. and, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! if you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie--way in excess of what you'd expect to find. they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems. so, as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re-write and re-editing.

if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then backdraft is definitely the one.however, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then backdraft has some serious flaws. it doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.after two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? well i was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.a good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.

i loved this movie when i was a teenager. loved it. it hasn't grown up with me, though. maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'goddammit' a lot. the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that william baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime. robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching, but no one's really at the top of their game here, and the women folk get particularly short thrift. the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and hans zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favourites.

the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie, stand by me, a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn't like it. he lends me a movie called backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it, instead i hated this movie. i don't think i've hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. i couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: billy baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who's being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it's own. i just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters, two brothers. stephen "bull" mccaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. donald "shadow" rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .martin swayzak is an alderman on the city council. he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. however, swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.i just couldn't get into this movie, i don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. i loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick. i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, donald sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. i know ron was going for great quality, but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey. the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, i didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, i'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.2/10

the unfunniest so called comedy i've ever seennot a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dare twin townvegas i ;like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well english in the worst way (in recent years the english films have been awful all of them) ireland at least produced the commitments, scotland with braveheart and trainspotting 2 stand out great movies and wales had twin town, zulu, last days of dolwyn , torchwood, doctor who and under milk wood etcthe comedy is paint by numbers, the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunnyengland is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce. it's the old class system that destroys english films. the oxbridge graduates spewing endlessly clichéd scripts about working class people they've never lived with. it is pathetic. monty python wasn't funny, neither was anything from oxbridge.let guys like jonny vegas and peter kay, rob brydon, billy connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the british and english film industries will rise again what next prince edward to write a modern day oliver twist?

now i like johnny vegas which is a good start, i also enjoy toilet humoursuch as young ones and bottom etc. this however failed to bring even asmall smile to my face. the story follows johnny around after his wifechucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) as he attempts to shag anything that moves. failing normally. i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a wasteof my time altogether. unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother..... 

oh sex lives of the potato men, what foul demon created thee? this is a film that you watch, smirk a little during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it, you just cannot help but smile as you talk. but it's not that sex lives of the potato men is actually a funny film and one that inspires you to smile when talking or thinking about it, it's just that the film is so bizarre; is so insulting and is no shameless in its attempt to get across a meek laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin. do bear in mind that what follows the smirk is a sinking of the head; a consequent shake of the head and a raise of the index finger and thumb to both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to reminisce about your time watching this trash.but that's what the film is, it's trash; it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none-the-less. whoever came up with this idea, put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must either be very brave or very desperate. it's strange to have a film that is most definitely 'about' something but one that does not have, under any sort of circumstance, a decisive narrative. this follows on from that idea that most of european cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open-ended and themes take precedence over most other things. in sex lives of the potato men, the same situation and technically the same joke are replayed over and over again and that is an ideation that consists of: 'sex is a very, very funny thing.' these ideas are perhaps more suited to an american film so it's no wonder that after a while watching this film, things start to feel a little out of sorts.the film begins and ends in the same manner, creating a feeling of a circular journey; a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. three blokes sit around a table talking and what-not. their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios each can possibly think of. the odd thing here, being that whenever one man says something nasty, the other grimaces but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not. the men are dave (vegas) and ferris (crook), two people joined by tolly (coleman) whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories. they are employed by jeremy (gattis), a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of humour rather than study.so what's the situation in sex lives of the potato men? the three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week. if the humour revolving around dave and ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then for jeremy things are just spooky. it all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in, that's when the jaws drop. the character of jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general merely look 'funny'. jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to ruth (davis), echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with hannibal lecter writing his letter's to clarice in 2001's hannibal. but whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when, later on, it is revealed the true origin of their relationship. suddenly, we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and distasteful. to say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film.quite sad how, in one of jeremy's letters, he writes about something-or-other exclaiming it to have "no artistic vision  just one big mess". i hate it when words said by the characters echo the film they're in. sex lives of the potato men does not explore someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible, it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously unfunny jokes and situations. rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down, it makes a daft joke out of it (tickets with numbers on!?); rather than get into the mindset of a fan of sadomasochism, the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he climaxes. ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss. it's a relief the film got to no audiences abroad. this is one section of british culture, indeed of the british mentality that i pray will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly.

an in-name-only sequel to john carpenter's vampires, this movie takes place in thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires, who enjoy killing people, and a sect of good vampires who do not. while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand, the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale. this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles. which brings me to my next point, which is that this seems a lot like blade lite. we've got the rock soundtrack, the martial art battle scenes, a dance club bloodletting and, of course, lots of sharp objects going through vampires. what we don't have is the budget and talent. yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad his acting wasn't as good, and there's plenty of decent wire work, and tons of revved up fight sequences, maybe too many. the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films. perhaps it's just that the film has a "been there seen that" feel to it.however, for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead, played by the buff and bland colin egglesfield, and his girlfriend. she gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. we have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot.in the end, you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this, but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time, like renting any of the blade movies.

there's a good story well hidden and never really used! the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. what is left is muddled and superficial.turn off your brain and watchyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.

this movie "vampires: the turning" isn't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it. the movie, is very predictable from beginning, up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers. the use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. the acting, was b-rank at best... and the movie was just, dull. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. oh, and did i mention the wardrobe? the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to "non-existent" because our hero, and his girlfriend (whom he's trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie. i'd suggest this film only if your really bored, and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~dave, the horror cowboy

even though this was set up to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay, "vampires: the turning" (vtt) could have aspired beyond that. because it doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie, vtt fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to.using the idea of an 800-year-old thai vampire was interesting, but the story about progeny she mistakenly brought into existence (and now must wipe out) actually reminds me of gizmo and his plight in "gremlins," and that isn't a good thing when it come to a vampire flick.stephanie chao is attractive and serves as the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of any accent grates when you realize that she's an 800-year-old vampire. added to that, when she tells connor he's "a young soul," she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an "old" soul. attractive, but not believable.meredith monroe was more believable in her role but, for a "dawson's creek" alum, you would think she would have more screen time. the question of whether amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie, and you never get it. you get a tease of it, but you never actually get any type of development out of the characters for that plot device. it's a cheap way to play your audience, folks.if you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find lugosi's "dracula," and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of flicks from hammer with a lot more strength than this one. in the end, if you want good or sexy, this isn't the place. this is just forgettable.

in thailand, the americans connor (colin egglesfield) and his girlfriend amanda (meredith monroe) quarrel in a muay-thai fight, and amanda leaves connor alone. she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire niran (don hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. connor joins to a clan of "good" vampires leaded by sang (stephanie chao), trying to save amanda from the claws of niran.i expected that "vampires: the turning" were a good movie. the locations and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive; but unfortunately, the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts. the story is very short, and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race, fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film. my vote is four.title (brazil): "vampiros: a conversão" ("vampires: the conversion")

this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. henry may long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced merchant ivory-type features. i suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'brokeback mountain.' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it is truly a dark and depressing film.

if you're a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you weep inside. granted, i'm only about 1/2 hour into it currently, but it's so painful, i felt it was my duty to warn away real ten commandments fans before they are subjected to this bastardization. i didn't think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in 1950s when the original was shot, but this 2006 remake proves me wrong. i can forgive some lame special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, melodramatic lifetime movie-style schlockiness, and the stilted we-are-wax-figures-come-to-life acting makes me hope they'll rewrite the plot and drown moses in the red sea.

i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. this movie is awful from the demille version. all the way through this movie i was saying to myself, huh??? - what???? - i don't remember that part. the only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the red sea. and in heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version. did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the red sea was being parted? i think i did. anyway, i might - might - watch the last part tonight.i wish hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies. instead of re-hashing old films.they should of left well enough alone.update:well i watched the last part. did moses make up the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand - or was i seeing things - please someone - email me and let me know. horrible

i realise it's very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a charleton heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. even the animated the prince of egypt was better.the one thing that threw me off was ramses. compared to yul brynner's version, paul rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-pharoh like. the acting really wasn't that great. for a modern adaptation, i was expecting something better. it just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one. i guess they were running on a tight budget or something. there's an occasional voice-over narrator which i found strange and unnecessary. it also broke up the flow of the story. and um...god's voice/lines were kinda weird.

this movie was dreadful. biblically very inaccurate. moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of egypt, the movie has him about forty. moses was about forty when he fled egypt, was gone for forty years, and was with them wandering for forty years. moses was 120 years old when he died, and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land. i realize movies use a lot of "poetic license" as the biblical account isn't that long, but, if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known, and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character, this movie fails in this aspect, and in many others.even though the 1956 version has its problems as well, theatrically it was much better.

i as a christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture. the film's website says they researched the movie before writing but i believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source the bible. i sat with two different versions of the bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. it was like they made up what was not in the bible and changed what was in the bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth. i personally am too young to remember the 1950's ten commandments but it can't be any worse than this. i have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty.

i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of moses and the exodus of israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon moses' shoulders. as excited as i was to see this film, i was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (i'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) what is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from biblical texts. one of the overarching principles from the bible is that *god* led his people out of egypt, and he promised that he would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey. not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. he never left them; he always was visible to the israelites. the movie, however, depicts a god who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert. this movie changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts god as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void.in addition, the depiction of moses was just as wrong. moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be such a father-figure to israel throughout the old and new testaments, even that moses is known as a man of great faith). however, the movie depicts him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure loner who despises the calling that god placed on his life. ok, i'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the exodus story... but this is beyond creativity -- it is heresy.

with a name like "10 commandments" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible, specifically exodus. not so here. this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark-made film. remember "noah"?? that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. at least this film had "some" truth to the original story. however, menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of moses, is not in the original story. other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated. so what, you may ask? because this should be representative of the actual story; otherwise, some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened. in today's age, people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible. also, it is a great error. see revelation 22:18-19. the script is already written. why change it? other than the account in exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have the cecil b. demille film to compare it to, which is clearly a far better presentation.the night it first aired, my wife was anxious to see it. i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark-film. she looked puzzled and said, "why? hallmark makes good movies". that might be so, but they butcher the bible. i'm sorry to say that i was correct. not just the story, but the acting as well. with today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie. i'm still waiting...

if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical (or torah) portrayal of the events in exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the bible have been "created" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a shepherd priest who gave moses excellent advise. god is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that moses had to figure things out for himself. nothing could be further from the truth.this movie is a typical humanistic twist on biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on moses for trying to understand what god wants and what he should do. those who know the book of exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie, but outright glaring changes to events. most importantly, they will see a near total absence of god's dialog with moses, which determines everything moses does after the burning bush. far from being alone as portrayed in the movie, moses is guided by god with detailed and direct communication.even hallmark apparently can't acknowledge god's direct role, and without his spoken words to moses many events make no sense. to compensate, hallmark has actually changed some things. for instance, after the golden calf god plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live. hallmark creates a civil war instead and the israelites pick sides, then slaughter each other. moses side wins of course.there may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. the twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their bible. read exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.

this movie deviated from the bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie. i hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally seen 10 commandments. moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind looking man charelston heston in the 1956 movie. i will not waste my time again watching this movie. they tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one at that). i'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but to each his own. also, it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, it probably took them 2 months to make this one. the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.

it's painfully clear that all effort in this film was directed toward cinematography and very little attention to everything else. most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast. many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed out of place, and having an amateur director certainly didn't help. the story is a very common geisha story, and characters behaved very inconsistently, thus making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine. this movie's theme is "modern prostitution", but still, it was annoying how tsuchiya anna's lead character kept talking like a female motorcycle gang member while everyone else spoke in old japanese fitting for this setting. this movie has very beautiful vibrant colors, similar to zhang yimou's "hero", but viewers can easily tell it's filmed in a cheap, elaborate set.the two sequences with shiina ringo's insert songs were really nice though, in mid-section of the movie. i actually really disliked her music before, but they fit perfectly in this movie. although ninagawa mika is a complete failure as a film director, she has a major potential in pv (music video) production.i believe the story felt very plain because the director failed to focus on character development, and because tsuchiya anna's unconvincing acting as an oiran. had this film been directed by a known jidaigeki director with any other known actress in japan, it would've had the potential to become a masterpiece.

i just realized why the colors and sets in "sakuran" were so flashy and gaudy, and just painful to look at. the story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in japanese. their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. but the director, mika ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. what anna tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. you couldn't call it acting. it was nothing more than catering to her flipped-out, high-school-girl fan base. hey anna, good luck on that one as you get older. yeah, right, an oiran as a crude and vulgar, prone- to-violence, biker chick. didn't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie?the story was painfully boring and predictable. what is the story of "sakuran"? an obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that: an obnoxious bitch. she finds that, inexplicably, men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful, high-class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she's a member of a female biker gang. this so-called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action, probably due to the ineptitude of the main, pretend-phony-biker chick, i mean "actress." the main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer. not very oiran-like, is it? how could such a woman ever become an oiran? oh, because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price. who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap? rumors get around. how could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy? because the screenwriters are dolts. they just made up a bunch of crap.then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her (why?) and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is (which doesn't make sense. how can anyone respect someone so worthless?).speaking of crap, it's like the director squatted down and took a huge, psychedelic-colored dump on the aesthetics, culture, and society of the edo period. what of such things as sabi, mono no aware, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a rigidly hierarchical society? all shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless, nouveau-riche parvenu. the amazing thing is that so many other japanese, in watching this movie, squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing-colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was.argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the edo period when japan was totally isolated from the international world (except for the 3.7 acres of dejima)? why not just have anna, the bad-ass-biker oiran, answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red ferrari? the music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic (the same as the art design). near the ending, i liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree. but, earlier, the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed, we all knew exactly what would happen. how boring, to telegraph the ending so clearly. but what's the point of the old tree blooming? that rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of yoshino in spring. that didn't impress her at all? no, of course not. i already know that about whores. the guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls. maybe it bugs the whores to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are: just cheap and worthless.considering the director's obsession with goldfish, the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over. two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters, belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and can't survive outside (just like the denizen's relationship with the pleasure quarters). otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning.in the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom, but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms. i couldn't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene. the sky would go quickly from hints of shadow, into an ever- deepening gloom, and night would fall. it would become cold, very cold. and dark. that really wasn't a happy ending, was it? romantic love (in the edo period?) could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed. maybe a few days, unless it rained sooner. but the unconsummated romantic love we see here? it's existence in this period is incomprehensible.anna tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran? she couldn't do it. literally. check out the scene of her "promenade" where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy's shoulder to keep from tumbling on her ass.i was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then i realized what that was all about: sick dominance on the part of the director. those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming, "i'm the most important one here! me! it's all about me!!!!"

in his feature film debut `yellow,' chris chan lee attempts to enlighten hollywood's portrayal of asian-americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film. however, in so doing, lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates asian-americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity. the result? dreadfully one-dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over-acting, ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch.don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by `yellow'; each falls into one of two camps. in one corner (e.g., right here on imdb.com), you find asian-americans who are so elated that an asian character can be depicted onscreen without thick glasses and a math book, that they somehow neglect the idiocy of lee's final product. on the other hand, you find movie critics who have simply presumed that it'd be uncool to give `yellow' the thorough bashing that it deserves; after all, it's an edgy asian-american film made by an independent asian-american filmmaker... protected territory for now.case example: main character sin lee (michael chung). writer/director lee accomplishes a monumental feat with sin, by editing `yellow' in such a way that sin never appears onscreen unless he is either scowling or yelling. see sin resenting his friends' support. scowl. see sin walk along the beach and brood. scowl. (yelling ensues.) see sin closing up his father's shop. scowl. see sin urinating. scowl. see sin breathing. scowl.gee, i wonder if sin is full of asian-american angst. do you think? i'm not sure. scowl. scowl.just to be thorough, lee introduces us to sin's father, woon lee (soon-tek oh). throughout the movie, whereas sin simply scowls or yells, mr. lee scowls *and* yells. in fact, this is woon's principal role in `yellow': simultaneous scowling and yelling.gee, i wonder if woon is an asian father with an authority complex. do you think? i'm not sure. scowl. yell.if lee's one-dimensional characters don't annoy you, his story line will. meet mina (mary chen) and joey (john cho), two characters that exist in this film solely for the purpose of spinning a tangential and entirely irrelevant love story into the film. you see, lee learned in film school that every good movie must include some sort of love-related subtext, and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. mina and joey's excruciatingly inane flirting dialogue consists of one-liner insults culminating in a kiss: `nerd!'; `stupidhead!'; (eyes meet); (understanding smile); (kissing ensues).but rest assured, somewhere out there, sin is scowling while this all takes place.that neither mina nor joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the film's plot does not perplex me so much as lee's insistence on the most hackneyed movie cliches to accomplish his nonsequiturs. and trust me, the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg.towards the end of the film, we find woon lee attempting to explain his constant scowling and yelling to sin's girlfriend, teri (mia suh), in what i am sure lee meant to be a poignant moment. what a surprise: as woon invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point, ripped straight out of reader's digest, his voice quivers in that extra-special paternal way. the camera pans into an obligatory shot of teri's trembling hands. we feel compelled to roll our eyes, except we realize that woon's explanation makes no sense whatsoever. but lack of substance didn't stop lee from making the movie, so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene? after all, the world can always use another cliché.well, you say, the movie may be painful, but at least it *must* be a technical masterpiece -- say, like, `what dreams may come.' sorry, on a technical basis, `yellow' disappoints as well. lee's edits are awkward and disrupt what little rhythm exists in the film at all, but i'm sure lee thought they would seem hip. to make matters worse, every frame is either underexposed or overexposed. although the light meter was invented in 1932, somehow the newfangled technology didn't make it onto the `yellow' set.in light of the film's utter deficiency, supporting actor burt bolos, who plays sin's best friend alex, performs relatively well. although bolos overacts slightly, you can't really blame him when lee's script consists solely of scowling and yelling. bolos' castmates, on the other hand, show no restraint in their overacting whatsoever.i have not seen a film as bad as `yellow' in a very long time. and i truly pray that i will not see a film as bad as `yellow' for quite some time, as well. please do not waste see it; life is already way too short. thank you.

wow, what an overrated movie this turned out to be! it was supposed to be "an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home." well, i doubt it terrorized audiences in the early '50s and i know it would put today's audiences asleep."sends shivers down the spine," proclaims the new york times. no, the only shivers i get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the n.y. times prints about anything.well, it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man. "howard wilton" (robert ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. in fact, this was one of the nicest roles ryan ever played! yes, "wilton" was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trust.the film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of yakking. beware, my reader.....this sucks.

this early film from director bob clark ("porky's", "black christmas", "a christmas story") didn't really pump my nads like i expected. in fact, it straight up annoyed me. it's about a theater troupe who sail to a burial island, consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect some corpses... the leader of their group, a conceited black-magic enthusiast and possible homosexual, attempts to summon satan's help with the re-animation of an exhumed body, which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby, deserted caretaker's house and play with it... nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the desecrater's. the make-up effects are okay, the gore is very minimal (pg rating), and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much, which really got on my nerves. i guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some "comedic" status, yet i found no humor in it, whatsoever. the entire concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did. the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring... don't waste your time with it...

it's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre. my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion.children shouldn't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out. the whole idea of a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses had me intrigued. however, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. the actors,who for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive, were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization. some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery, to outspoken criticism, back to ambivalence. it's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film; it's another to produce an overly dynamic, circular attitude that loops every ten minutes.another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead? even with the aforementioned flaws, i would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since i believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency. the scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting (even to a veteran zombie enthusiast) by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead. current filmmakers should learn from cspwdt about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development.all in all, if you are zombie movie completionist like me, you should take time to locate and view this movie. it's a fun watch.

i'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting - both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films. however, what i didn't count on is this film being really, really boring; if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately, this film has neither. i'm quite surprised, because the previous two horror films i've seen from director bob clark - deathdream and black christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining films, but children shouldn't play with dead things just doesn't cut it. the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life. however, they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood!the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick, but what i didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, i'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing. the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters. i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along; but please, if you're going to spend so long on it, you've really got to make it interesting. all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying, and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. the film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well; but bob clark already did it with this film. the direction isn't bad either, but it's brought down by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies. overall, i really can't recommend this film; but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you may get a kick out of it.

i've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. date movie. that was bad. but this...this is just...it's not good. house party 4 is the worst movie ever. it's as simple as that. it's basically ferris bueller with black people in it. oh, and it's not funny. it's awful. so awful. chris stokes may be a superstar on bet, but he's an idiot. he can't write a comedy. or a horror movie. i like to refer to him as a blacker, lesser-known uwe boll. except uwe boll's films are funny awful, if you know what i mean. you can invite some buddies over, pop in alone in the dark, and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies. chris stokes is like that, except if you invite friends over to watch house party 4 with you, no one will be laughing. not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock. i'm serious, i didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie. the acting is terrible, and the movie looks like a bad indie film. what was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? i mean, what the hell? this movie just sucks; don't waste your time with this crap. it's disgusting.

i'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. even though marques houston did appear in "hp3", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. okay...so reid and martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. i'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was "hoodwinked"--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. and i'm sorry...kym whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris, ketty lester, or dc curry in the earlier films. although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion...i have to give this a thumbs down!! just naming the film "down to the last minute" would have been ok. furthermore, the hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.

artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel dinelli from his play "the man" concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal. despite solid work from ida lupino and robert ryan (both trying their best), this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually dull) and underpopulated cast of characters (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!). hokey and humorless, with a stilted direction from harry horner (perhaps lupino should have directed?). where's all the suspense promised by the ads? dinelli also served as a co-producer. *1/2 from ****

watching this movie, you just have to ask: what were they thinking? there are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie, you might get the feel that its intentionally poor, as some sort of joke.i think the worst part about the film is the directing. there are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad. the funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations by email - the same camera angle is used for each shot (which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece) and the same computer screen with the same desktop/window/program etc appear. it even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time. the whole sequence was also completely silent, with no music, or sound effects. overall, it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over town.if you listen closely, you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks. this is no surprise- most songs, including the one that opens the movie, are in fact slight alterations of scores from other movies (see if you can guess which ones). also, i noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. it sounds like its been written and played through a low end midi keyboard. if you are familiar with the lucasarts scum adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the imuse engine.everything else about the movie just plain sucks. the acting is terrible. the script is derivative (ferris beuller?). there is no joke in the movie remotely funny, unless you see the whole film as one big joke, being played on a paying audience. don't rent this. don't even watch it when it's rerun on comedy central. just forget this - it's terrible.

i too am a house party fan...house party i is my favorite movie of all times. house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the hp's and to kid n play...this was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at house party 3. i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and i have been a fan ever since. when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking about...there was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off.

i saw house party 1-3 and i loved them but this one wasn't funny at all.first it can't be a house party movie without kid n'play right? this one sucks and it was more like a black version of ferris bueller's day off than a house party movie.second who the heck is john-john?these new character's can't even compare to the ones from the other three movies.now i know why they put it straight to video.it has horrible music, weak plot, untalented actors,and no hilarious jokes at all.my advice,watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep.they should have ended the series after house party 3 since kid'n'play separated after that one.i hate this one am glad my local video store doesn't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on comedy central either.just because chris strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming r&b group doesn't mean he has talent directing and producing films am i right or what? finally, the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the flick.imx separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays. in simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks!!!!

i've never saw the first three, but i know they're all better than this...trash. it's about some kid who throws a party. wow. sounds amazing(sarcasm). is it? nooo! it starts off with a kid laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom. so, the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school. he goes to his uncle's house and rounds up some people and throws a party. i didn't laugh at all while watching this trash. i can't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking "man, dis !@#$ is gunna be big, yo!" makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie. i watched this knowing it would be bad, but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. this just disgusted me. two thumbs down!

(spoilers ahead!) this same exact plot from this movie has been done before. it has been done in ferris bueller's day off! marques "bat man" houston plays sick. his gullible parents believe him. his sister knows that he's faking, but she still must go to school! she is mad. he has a party with his friends while his parents are away. by the time his parents get home, he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party. i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature!

after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies. i should have followed my instincts.i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldn't. the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst. everything in this production is amateurish.always a joy to watch, mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation. i won't even bother checking the name of the leading man - hopefully he's back doing commercials.even poor vanessa redgrave, whom i adore and respect, seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home. maybe she needed the money.if i can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated.

this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "actors" (with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip, all of the "performers" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. the "new" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading(?) this film, while boasting a creative premise ala 'dead men don't wear plaid', is a technical and creative wreck. in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to 'fog island', whatever that is! the "flashback" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. unrelated scenes from 'the lost world' (1925), the most dangerous game (1932), white zombie (1932), bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla (1952) and some other poverty row productions. this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera.the "filmmakers" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors (carradine, zucco, ouspenskaya, etc..etc..). this tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in 'final destination' here it's just obnoxious! bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about spiderman, dracula, and superman abound. even the old as dirt 'dewey, cheetam and howe' lawyer reference is used here-this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s.the film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi. the finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy.truth be told though, it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. maybe thats what they wanted to happen!

what a waste of time. i got about five minutes into it and became *very* antsy, and was soon fast-forwarding a bit, and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast-forward button was nonexistent. actors mark redfield and barry murphy did very capable jobs, i thought, but no one else i saw gave anything like a good performance. again, take this review with a large grain of salt because the movie was just so unbearable i couldn't make it to the end. heck, i couldn't make it to the middle !!i find myself unable to submit this review because it isn't long enough. maybe this last sentence will put it over the top.

the only reason this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the acting of both ida lupino and robert ryan is superb. ida lupino who is lovely, as usual, becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman. robert ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to the next. seemingly simple and docile, suddenly he becomes clever and threatening. ms. lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along. she could not manage to get out of her of her own house: windows didn't open, both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. you could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried. she did not take the precaution of having even one extra key. nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor. i don't know what war her husband was killed in, but if it was world war ii, the furnishings in her house, the styles of the clothes, especially the children and the telephone company repairman's car are clearly anachronistic. i recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find.

problems: 1) although billed as "a loving tribute to poverty row," a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films-- much of it is from rko's "the most dangerous game," (1932), with some from the silent (!?) version of "the lost world" (1926)! 2) much of the old footage is just used as filler (the old shipboard footage) or as silent shots (for example, of bela walking, looking or staring) often repeated; 3) where is the pantheon of poverty row master thespians (bela, boris, lon chaney, jr., george zucco, john carradine, buster crabbe, tom neal, etc.) emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes (as in woody allen's "what's up tiger lily?" or steve martin's "dead men don't wear plaid")? even mike nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized "reefer madness" is funnier than this. high point: the long but extremely enlightening lecture by gregory mank which makes you give new respect to and admiration for bela, john carradine and george zucco. that's worth the price of the dvd alone!

this is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. it was the first i had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. it was brutal; the worst thing i had ever seen on film.dr. clement molloch, played by joseph mayer, is still one of the most evil characters i've ever seen on film, and i've viewed thousands. he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again, nor would i recommend it. he makes hannibal lecter look like mr. rogers. if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun, then stay away from this film.i know there are a lot of sick people out there, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick story. it's a "b" movie, anyway, with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson. this is not one of his better efforts. even if it was, there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn't want to watch. trust me on this one.

does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents . one edition featured charles bronson ( robbie coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie glc :" it's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner " " and after glc what next for bronson ? " " we're using a new angle . my family don't get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same " this accurately describes the evil that men do . it's a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of " the doctor " , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . it's never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents as you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor's sister being a lesbian so some t&a can be included in many ways it's like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons . believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed

it's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy charles bronson vehicle. bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. he was quietly moving in the tv movie "yes virginia, there is a santa claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the sean penn-directed "the indian runner".in "the evil that men do", however, bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns. there's nothing here you haven't seen in the last five "death wish" flicks. wait, i take that back. this has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film bronson has ever had the dis-service of being in. not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture, but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets. and jose ferrer! what in blue blazes was he doing here?!! i mean, he won an oscar, for crying out loud!!! okay, sorry about that outburst. let me just say that "the evil that men do" has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen that was based on a book. yeah, that's right. i wonder if it was written with bronson in mind?no stars. watch "death wish" instead. at least it was topical.

once again bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. the fact that "the evil that men do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. it is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. one hopes this fine actor will rise again.

yet again, director j. lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. in fact, this is probably bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish, ten to midnight and chato's land). however, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment. if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. the story is about a retired hitman (bronson) who lives a cosy life on a caribbean island. he is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various south american hell-holes. throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is. these themes are actually quite serious. torture does go on in suppressive latin american dictatorships, and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint. but the evil that men do - for all its worthy posturing - isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people. it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scum-bags. it's just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues. the torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick-in-the-head voyeur, rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing "snuff" movies. the script is full of horrid dialogue, including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas... its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. sorry, but that's just wrong.

during an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the cannon group: 'the evil that men do,' a tristar films pickup from sir lew grade's itc entertainment firm. bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director j. lee thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'kinjite: forbidden subjects' in 1989.expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a better-funded outfit like itc, but 'the evil that man do' is a great disappointment on many levels. while still from the low budget, b-movie mold of the 1980s, 'evil' has tantalizing potential for a great film. everyone in the production department, however, took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of bronson's imprint. 'the evil that men do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and thompson's best films, but instead will go down as one of their most average.this 1984 political thriller/actioner opens in brutal fashion with clement molloch (joseph maher), a british doctor, holding his special training class for political leaders in surinam. the gray-haired, passive molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes. in the opening seven minutes, we witness molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on jorge hidalgo (jorge humberto robles), a dissident journalist. as you may expect, the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs release.hidalgo was none other than a friend of holland (bronson), a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the cayman islands. holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of molloch, but turned the offer down. a mexican professor named hector lomelin (josé ferrer) visits shortly after hidalgo's death to talk holland into finishing the job, bringing videotapes of testimony from the doctor's victims. while in denial at first, holland eventually agrees to the dirty work, targeting molloch and his doting sister claire (antoinette bower) in guatemala.holland enters guatemala city with help from an adviser, max ortiz (rené enríquez); he poses as a tourist with hidalgo's widow rhiana (theresa saldana) and young daughter sarah (amanda nicole thomas) in tow. as with most of bronson's later output, his character knocks off molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing paths with a sleazy american diplomat (john glover) and his supporting hit-man (roger cudney) along the way. a brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine, where the doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims.'the evil that men do' is based on a forgotten novel by r. lance hill and jumps at american political dealings in latin america during the 1980s. indeed, 'evil' is hard-boiled in every sense of the term, as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development. for every plus this film has, there are three or four minuses, resulting from shod craftsmanship.while 'the evil that men do' has a great concept, the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreign-based scum. in the style of bad pulp fiction, 'evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. holland, despite being played strongly by bronson, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire. rhiana, a terribly weak part for theresa saldana, is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him. where does her love come from, especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before?the most interesting characters are actually molloch and his sister claire, because so many questions can be asked of them. naturally, we never find out what has brought them so close together, how and where their torture dealings started, what claire's exact role in their business isthese plot holes can go on forever, especially with the paint-by-numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along. why is hidalgo's daughter brought into such a dangerous situation, other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by molloch? if molloch's bodyguard randolph (raymond st. jacques) clearly saw holland and rhiana in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords? is his memory that short? and what really was the purpose, other than cheap theatrics, of holland throwing molloch's chauffeur cillero (jorge luke) off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in claire's apartment?the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances. j. lee thompson's direction is lacking at points, but may have been compromised by limited time on site. besides evil's filming in mexico, the presence of itc is clear through better production values, cinematography, and music. rural locations are well-used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer xavier cruz provides rich color and clarity. the orchestral score by ken thorne ('murphy's war') is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk. oddly enough, these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out. peter lee thompson's editing is better than usual, although with more laughable continuity errors.'the evil than men do' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and i find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans. the dvd from columbia tristar entertainment is an okay presentation, offering widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. while the video quality is well above average, 'evil' was originally recorded in plain mono audio. the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality.** out of 4

originally, the spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. i dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. this one is no exception. in the first part of the spiders, 'the golden lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the spiders--to steal gold from incas. a silly love triangle ensues, with some cowboys and indians action. the sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.one can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to lang's later, far superior work. and, the film-making is better than in other serials i've seen from this time, including 'les vampires' (1915). in the spiders, the camera isn't as static, and this film is fast paced, thankfully. the tinting and lighting are adequate, too. none of that's remarkable, though. it's nearly unseemly, however, in how closely this series resembles louis feuillade's serials; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in 'les vampires'--only the names, and to a lesser extent, the situations have changed.for the further comments on the spiders series, see the web pages for it.

beware, my lovely (1952) dir: harry horner production: the filmmakers/rko radio picturescredulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of collier young and ida lupino, aka the filmmakers (with lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). robert ryan is the 'peril' and ida lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the 'woman in peril' style film. ryan plays howard wilton, a tightly-wound psychotic handyman drifter (noooo, ryan? i know, hard to believe). lupino is the lonely war widow, helen gordon, who hires howard to do some work around her house. things go downhill from there as howard makes helen a prisoner in her own home. howard has a nasty secret, not that he could reveal it. you see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. maintaining it, that is. he has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead. this is part of the film's problem. the nature of howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). he can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. his violent, threatening, anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting, inadequacies involving the war, due to his being rejected for service). i don't know how he even made it past the interview with helen. there are other implausibilities. if you were locked in your house with a madman, but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time, couldn't you figure out a way to escape? ryan, i think, is defeated by the material. it feels like he's overplaying his hand. his series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there, done-that robotic feel to them. at this point in his career he'd probably played this character, to some degree, ten times and it shows. we are encouraged to empathize with howard (i didn't) through shown bits of humanity, like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him. lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress, which she is more than capable of and does. the picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? so naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, christmas tree decorations). this indicated something going on, or about to go on, in his head. horner (1953's vicki), who made his reputation in production design, does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison. credit too, the always reliable rko art department for the work on the house. in the end, sub-standard work from the principals, who all have much better films to their credit. *½ out of 4

it's just a bad film.not as bad as r.i.c.c.o. but bad.it got me hooked at the beginging then totally lost me after that.the acting was way off then on then going way way way off.do not see this movie at all costs,trust me with all my heart!!!!the directors who are brothers are not the next hughes brothers,who made really great films like dead presidents,from hell,american pimp,and menace ii society.the only person who made me watch this was the acting of paris campbell,who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this.christina caparoula also did a nice job for what she got.i hope the fittest is 10 times better than this piece of crap!

this film has no plot, no good acting, to be honest it has nothing, the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you. i wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous! ice-t isn't even a good rapper and even worse at acting, every bit of the film is rubbish, i got this film on dvd without knowing what it was for the price of £1.99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain, i then looked at the imdb rating and didn't take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the dvd i had bought was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it!

i really enjoyed the film. it was really cheesy at times. (they destroy the villain with hair driers--but where are they plugged in?) it's a unique film though, and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope. i also enjoyed fanuel (however you write it...) liking megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb. besides the acting, the "rewinding" and showing what happened on ariel's and then megan's point of view was quite interesting. i saw it twice and i'd see it again

this is a silly movie with much singing and dancing. acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. there are rememberable performances by buddy epsen, with a short but outstanding performance by gypsy rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. a totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating exibition of alice in wonderland. many parts are worth watching, but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie

the movie that would be included if mystery science theater 3000 had a home game version! the source material for tacky comments in this movie are endless. i found the video of terror in the jungle at a garage sale. what a find!

an unbelievable plot, laughable characters, and obvious errors (in one scene where several grass huts are supposed to be burning, a gas torch can be seen repeatedly trying to ignite one of the huts), this film is a real dog.

altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. he doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. the problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.on this "turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me), altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino. (mr. tarantino, if you're reading this, please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) he doesn't use subtle moves to do that, all he does is to use extreme stuff, and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable.levent üzümcü as the forensic guy with the cow-licked hair is just hilarious. i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself. because i really found the role insulting for him. demet evgar groping her genitalia was also uncalled for, and did nothing other than making everything look fake. another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% faulty pace setting. when things need to be taken slowly, scenes flow abruptly. and at other times, it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on.if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality, he should use michael sixarrows as his name instead. even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie. he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach, then realize he's not in hollywood, and then take private lessons from zeki demirkubuz or reha erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot. this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those, but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps.by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and otostop, and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever.

this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. and of course us americans just have to remake everything successful into english, because man reading subtitles is sooooo hard isn't it! from what i've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant jessica alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) it looks exactly the same but probably w/double the budget. i thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks i have seen in any language in quite a long while. i would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together, there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason this even called "the eye 2" except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first flick. do yourself a favor watch "the eye" with the volume turned up and get ready for some probable jumping. i watched it w/headphones on and was pleasantly surprised on the excellence that was the direction of the pang brothers. if "the eye" remake does well which i'm hoping it does for the sake of the pang brothers movie careers, but at the same time it seems a shame that people won't/can't see the original, because very often/almost always the remake isn't as good as the original. watch this one if one wants to be mildly kinda of boring flick, but the original is no comparison to this sequel in name only flick.

****probably will contain spoilers****after a successful attempt to get attention (i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a "failed suicide attempt"), joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits.overall the movie was a little slow going, but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing. for a horror movie, there were only a few minor creeps and thrills. halfway through, however, was a really good scary scene (i wont give it away though) :) i watched this movie because i really liked the preceding movie, the eye.i was a little confused, however to determine that, other than being a "supernatural suspense" movie from the same creators, the eye 2 had no relation to the eye, *whatsoever*; different cast, different story. the eye2 does not even have anything to do with eyes :\the movie had a few questionable scenes: joey attempts suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train), she is associated with brutally defacing an attacker, she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely, without even so much as a psyche evaluation or put in the hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy).the movie was not the greatest horror movie, the story was rather far-fetched (even for a fiction movie :p ), the spooks were either few and/or nothing we have not seen before. however, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what the "truth" is behind the spooks, it was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story.i rate the movie 3 out of 10.

(the beginning might be a spoiler...)"the eye 2" is the sequel to "the eye". it's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. "the eye" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas "the eye 2" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. omit watching this. watching "the eye" is good enough.

i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.what??? this was probably the worst asian horror movie i've seen.*spoilers* there were just so many fundamental problems with the story. a lot of asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and ju-on). this is the case here except they aren't scary. a pretty asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all. the "monk" character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life; nothing scary there either. but the woman just doesn't get it, she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated. my friend and i were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she's been following her around. that information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever.*that said i did like a couple of parts right in the middle. first she rides a taxi with a ghost (ghosts ride taxis?) that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably is creepy. right after that at the bus stop, well you need to see it as it's pretty messed up.all in all this movie is a total bomb, i gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above. this is a poor quality asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women's wombs almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images.

harmony korrine - hate him or hate him? on this evidence, loathe might be a better word. not him of course, just everything he does. but it could've been so different because the first ten minutes of this film promises so much including a fantastic idea of a michael jackson impersonator falling in love with a marilyn monroe impersonator. fantastic. and set in paris! this could be great. but unfortunately, korrine may spark the odd decent idea but because he is an awful writer, the story fails on every level and the audience walkout i witnessed about an hour in is proof positive that he is the most boring and pretentious film-making out there. apparently the walk-out rate at its premiere in last years cannes festival was quite shocking. instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he switches the story stupidly to the confines of a château to introduce a bunch of other impersonators making the whole experience tedious and narratively barren. when will the independent cinema stop funding this upstart?

i watched this movie and all i can say is this...i am not a film student, nor am i some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that i don't understand. however, if i were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...yep! he's on drugs and i can picture it now...he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly? like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while, bounced to the ground and got up and walked away? *cackles* or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath? oh my god, i'm cracking up just thinking about it! dude! we gotta make a movie about it! and then he says to his friend as he's laughing...oh and wouldn't it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it? so to me, this is what happens when some guy does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie. should i have been doing lsd to understand what this guy was thinking so i could have had a laugh too? because i have to tell you, i wasn't laughing. i was yawning and checking the time.i think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. i had never heard of this director until i came to read the reviews, which i did because i was mad that i lost that last 2 hrs, or how ever long it was, (it felt like 12 hrs of my life) and i can't ever get it back, anyway...i have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art?? what the heck is that? so my point is sort of proved. this guy is not all there, he's a drug addict, and his movie is evidence of such...so please quit trying to find a deeper meaning to it. if one really wants to understand everything in this movie, go drop some lsd and sit back and relax, then it might actually make sense.it reminded me of the time i watched gus van sant's last days, another movie i was mad about watching. i cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie, if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one. it seems like, if the movie's director is totally off his rocker, or if it's a french movie with sex and subtitles, or if it's a cartoon, it is going to get great reviews, hands down, anything else is boring and has already been done. blah, bring on the boring please!

harmony korine. i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded.i know that there were big questions raised in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a god. all great questions, but i really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy. i'm all for real life being portrayed but come on. it's never funny when a wife is being raped, someone killing themselves (and family and friends find the body) and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons.the only good thing about this movie was the location it was filmed. there is a lot of beautiful places.i'm not a film student or even know all that much on the subject i admit this, but i do know that when i leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a film i would recommend to anyone.

...if only disney had stayed away from it. see, i think that this movie has some potential. well, the main character's situation does, at least. take out the whole jordan cahill thing, and you've got the beginnings of a decent movie! of course, you also lose more than half of the film, but, oh well. not that much of a loss.so, here it goes: you take a typical, preppy, suburban teenage girl (danielle panabaker, who's actually a decent actress) whose best friends screech a lot, mostly over a "pop sensation" (i'm assuming it's a direct quote from the movie; movie's like this almost always involve that particular phrase) named jordan cahill. except, of course, tpstg wants more out of life. enter brenda song's character, a sophisticated individual who is just what tpstg needs (honestly, i don't care what the character's real name is, i like the acronym better). the two new friends go to see jordan cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of the droolers), and they come out of it with his cell phone. hijinks ensue, and everything turns out alright in the end.if only disney, or any major film studio for that matter, didn't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds. or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them. it's sugar-coated crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with (a little film called 'high school musical' comes to mind...)

douglas sirk's inaugural "women's-picture" weepy for universal, based on a preachy, dogmatic, didactic novel by the intolerable lloyd c. douglas (author of that other beloved piece of crap, *the robe*). rock hudson, in the role that catapulted him to stardom, plays bob merrick, a drunken playboy worth untold millions who is more interested in chasing skirts and racing speedboats than in finishing his medical degree. in the first scene, he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. the accident nearly kills merrick, and thus he requires a rather mysterious "resuscitator machine" to keep him alive . . . meanwhile, across town, beloved surgeon dr. phillips finally drops dead from a heart condition. since the local hospital can maintain only one resuscitator at a time, phillips dies so that the louse may live. when merrick learns of this, he tries to make apologetic overtures to phillips' family, especially to the widow (jane wyman, coiffed and clothed in matronly hauteur), but indeed anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits at merrick like a brace of cobras. one doctor on the hospital staff even calls it "a total waste" that the playboy lived instead of the christ-like surgeon. hippocrates might have had something to say about that!these early scenes are where you'll find the typical sirkian iconoclasm: the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of middle-class, mid-century america, that one finds oneself rooting for the wastrel playboy to put whoopee-cushions under the ramrod fannies of these moral hypocrites. but, alas, no: the risible plot of the novel must proceed, and merrick soon finds himself getting converted by god, in the guise of pipe-puffing otto kruger, an artist who claims that phillips made him a better man and even a better painter. (why don't we see any of this amazing art?) we learn that the intolerably ubiquitous dr. phillips would often refuse payment for medical services rendered (though who exactly qualified for these "magnificent exemptions" is never made clear). this is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new outlook on life and an example of personal conduct. kruger even tries to make it all sound very illicitly exciting: "once you start this thing, there's no way out of it! it's an obsession . . . a magnificent obsession!" so merrick tries it out by again pestering the widow with apologetic overtures, but he somehow causes her to get hit by a car. she loses her eyesight. apparently, merrick will have several more stations-of-the-cross to trudge past before he can be accounted a decent fellow.but sirk continues to sneak in his revenges even as the movie grows more and more preachy. the most obvious bit has to be the presence of agnes moorehead as the head hospital nurse and wyman's friend and unrequited lesbian lover. note the disappointment on moorehead's face when merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows up to save wyman's life near the end. hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in hollywood at the time, is also used to great ironic effect. he and wyman -- dowdy and fifteen years older -- generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together, which, by the way, are purposefully few, presumably because any more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole enterprise. (one thing we feel certain of: if rock hudson was obsessed by anything, it certainly wasn't jane wyman.) it's a chronic case of *tea and sympathy*. sirk seemed to enjoy tweaking everyone's noses by having this gay actor -- who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era -- coolly drift through these exquisitely-colored "women's pictures". in fact, the director worked with hudson 6 or 7 more times, to best effect in the follow-up to this film, *all that heaven allows*, which re-teamed hudson with wyman but was also accompanied by a realistic plot. in *obsession*, meanwhile, we must endure god/kruger gazing beneficently down from an observation-window onto merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save wyman's life, in tandem with a musical score of swelling vocals from a cheesy hollywood choir.but to see why sirk is considered an auteur, check out the scene wherein wyman explains to her grown daughter that she can in fact tell the difference from night and day. the entire frame is blackened, here: the daughter is barely visible, and wyman's face is faintly silhouetted against a faint light. she goes on to say that she hates the night because "i know that dawn will never come again". a great, chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than *magnificent obsession*.4 stars out of 10.

this movie is not very bad tjough. but one cannot find anything new about the personality of marquis de sade from this movie. the movie tries to stay on the borderline between erotic and insightful and it cannot succeed at either. the cinematography is really bad (straigh-to video quality)

the revisionist history -- making the evil marquis de sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough. but the atrocious acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad. the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous. and, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands bound overhead, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia, choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability. if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do, or are a film student looking for bad examples, fast-forward through every scene not involving nudity.

i really don't know much about the marquis de sade, not having read any of his book, but i never imagined him as a flaming queen. carson kressley of queer eye for the straight guy, or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that nick mancuso gave us.the movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. what? they can't afford a room? i did find it cute that the madame (irina malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier's needs.the movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and i mean a lot! fans of gimli (john rhys-davies) might be interested in seeing him in a different role as inspector marais.

i have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film i felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. please don't! this is no disney film. this film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. the video box describes the film as a 'delight for all ages' and the imdb plot outline describes it as a 'family film'. i just had to find a definition of 'family film' and came across the following: "usually consisting of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination. whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way." not an apt description of tarka the otter, which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes, totally unsuitable for young children, and an ending that qualifies the film as a 'feel bad' movie. the lesson learned? as i said: life is cruel. family entertainment? i don't think so. unless you hate your family, that is. another review, more revealing than this but worth reading, can be found by following the 'external reviews' link.

i love ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. and the photography is quiet nice. we put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. so for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. when we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. about halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. lots of blood, not just a little. then at the end, there's a wild struggle with a dog, then blood clouds the water. you'd think, given the g rating, that's all you'll see...that they will imply one of the animals died. nope. they drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds. personally, as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese, cronenberg, tarantino. heck, i love the ultra violent battle royale. but those aren't kid movies and don't advertise themselves as such. if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. if you are like me and my wife though, you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one.

i don't know where to begin. perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. i don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or david arquette's "performance". it was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although i think the bull felt better afterwards. the filmmakers should find something about sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, i don't know, his talent as a singer!!!!). his family shouldn't have to relive that horror. thank god it was just shown on hbo and not released in theaters. please don't watch this if you have any self respect.

yah. i know. it has the name "sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? well, it's bad, trust me! i rented this thinking it was some movie i missed in the theaters. it's not. it's some garbage "movie" made by the folks at showtime (cable station). geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! it's not good. i am as big a sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb. boring. dull. unfunny. uninteresting. the only redeeming quality is that (assuming they did stick to the facts) you do learn about what happened to the captors of frank jr. otherwise it's just a stupid film.

underwoods goofy story about a young man(arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr. (nicholas). the film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, arquette is annoying throughout, ian nicholas was nonexistent, macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. this is a stupid film in my eyes, boring at times, not entertaining, just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody. imdb rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10

(only light spoilers in here)stealing sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time.you will see some poor performances all around in this movie. the drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won't shut up, or a victim's father responding to the criminal's death threat with "care for some tea?", none of it is believable. this quite comfortably fits into the "wannabe movie" category.you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. it's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. it's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.however, if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.i voted 4/10.

wow! after the first five minutes of watching this "film", i was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. it's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. i honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. the film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. i normally don't have a problem with sov movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. and where did they find these "actresses"? i have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake. watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean. bci entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge. this has to be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing. i want my 74 minutes back! if you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes, without either shooting your tv or committing mass homicide, then give a shot. after all, what have you got to lose?

i like bad films, but this thing is a steaming heap. from the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting, don't waste a second on this pile. fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script. want a real synopsis? ugly chicks in neon bikinis dancing for way too long. a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting. the on-location sets weren't even passable. the church scenes take place in a dance studio, and oh yeah - what's with the two tap-dance numbers that come up out of the blue?oh, and the total number of naked breasts, which couldn't have even saved this film - 0. add this one to the trash heap.

ok - say some college in southern california has an movie making class. and some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. and then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. and failed.that is my only explanation for this, this, thing. good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it. the picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot. well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was finished. but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this.stay away from this.

....is where i'm assuming this movie came from. i mean, i've watched plenty of b movies over the course of my young life so far, and i wouldn't even classify this as a b movie. i remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.so the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight. i mean, i can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie. according to most people on this site, manos the hands of fate and pod people are the worst movies (mst3k classics :-d)...i used to be one of them. then i saw this movie. usually i don't try to trash a movie too much, but the people who made this really do deserve it. it is that bad and that unbearable, and i'm assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten.

move over manos. back off boogens. it doesn't take a baby genius to know that malibu beach vampires (mbv for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to zarkorr the invader) the worst film ever. the only horror in this thing is watching it. i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. if this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. it's dreck. no wait. i dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. ulli lommel (of boogey man fame) would call it "uber dreck" or scheiße. it should be used to torture prisoners. if you find it on a shelf in a video store, back away from it quietly and notify the authorities.

if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. i am a huge fan of "b" movies, and i have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. this movie even surpasses the "so bad it's good" phase and goes straight on to the "so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it" phase.it is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1. the fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire (i use the term very, very, very loosely) was witty enough to film .2. they were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money .3. that someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick this crap up for distribution on a horror anthology dvd.were i a weaker man, i most likely would have jammed grapefruit spoons into my eyes and then blindly flung myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching this. as it stands though, i live ,but i am forever scarred by the experience.

wow -- this movie was really bad! you talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. the transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. the plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. even then... the amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. are all of those images necessary? my last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie. would the pd really send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel, or wherever to find a body, when the location of the perp is unknown? and why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden? it's like the writer was trying to fit in every hollywood cliche he could. don't waste your time seeing this piece of... something.

a formulaic story with all the tired cliches. i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! what a waste! how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced?  at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot. oh, and don't even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. yeah right. i can buy that. what next? fingers porn?

i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. i won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washington's finger lovingly. it may be the only thing he could move, but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washington's finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me. i laughed out loud and shook my head.the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se7en, but here it is executed far more simplistically, and far too obviously. to call it a poor-mans se7en would be an understatement, this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washington's best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film.

am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces. a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. by the time he returns (still no senior cops, socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie - this is new york isn't it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she'd stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! the horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary i'm afraid) but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington. this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners, entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible. now that was a bright idea eh? i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable.i have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie's lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended!

the bone collector is set in new york city & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts lincoln rhyme (denzel washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. jump forward four years & alan (gary swanson) & his wife lindsay rubin (olivia birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after new york cop amelia donaghy (angelina jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of alan. amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of lindsay. having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for rhyme & the police...directed by phillip noyce i watched the bone collector last night & i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the lambs (1991) & se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers i have seen, in fact it makes friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! the script by jeremy iacone was based on the book by jeffery deaver & is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin. for a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. the character's are truly awful & i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? why is he so impressed with her? then there's capatin cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain? then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target rhyme anything else. also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! how did that happen? i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? i mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of new york to choose from? there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going. there is so much wrong with the bone collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.with a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 the bone collector is well made with good production values & that hollywood gloss about it. i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen, i think she is absolutely terrible in this. denzel washington just sort of lies there really, queen latifah is awful & even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character.the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while, i saw it for free on telly last night & i still feel cheated & ripped-off. there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? works either way to be honest...

the movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer diedthe movie is good in parts but overall isn't greatthe scenes between rani and ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handledthe film is too similar to bollywood hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lostmilan luthria disappoints overall after kachche daagemusic is good but too many songsajay devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too rani is good sonali is good too rest are okay

my girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so i rented it. then i saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 oscars. great! this should be good ol' drama. this movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. but once the movie ended, i couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. virginia hill (annette bening) was extremely annoying, i just couldn't tolerate her character at all. warren beatty was excellent in the film acting-wise, but again i just found it hard to have sympathy for his character....he just came off essentially as a idiotic, hotheaded loser of a gangster..who had no place in 'the life' in the first place. how'd he get in with the likes of meyer lansky and lucky luciano anyway??? this film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling...what was the big deal with this movie? i just didn't feel a completeness with bugsy. beatty's antics, although acted quite well, just seemed too random and illogical. i'm guessing that's how siegel really was....but it was just too much of that. there just didn't seem to be much of a real story here. my basic assessment of it would be "a hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of 'las vegas'....but his failed attempt at the casino he builds, along with having no regard for his mob bosses' money gets him killed."what else is there besides that? i just didn't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment. there must've not been many movies to come out in 1991, how this was nominated for 10 oscars is beyond me (although the two it won is justifiable). 1.5/4 stars.

bugsy siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast. in addition to his dreams about las vegas, he toyed with the idea of acting. he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea.warren beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye, he's too old for this part. beatty was miscast; bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin. bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; beatty just doesn't radiate menace.this was a vanity project for beatty, who hasn't come to terms with the fact that he's no longer a leading man.the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft. raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms, none of which mantegna even attempts to match. you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets.warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye, and now it;ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts.

a tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more ruthlessly. i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn. warren beatty's performance as the stupid and unlikeable bugsy seigel leaves you wishing you were watching someone else. once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just can't care about him. annette benning gives a skilled turn as his untrustworthy lover but even she's only faintly more savoury than he is.i really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama unless you're a benning devotee.

not as bad as "billy bathgate" but close. try as he might, warren beatty just could not be believed as bugsy. whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, i found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. the other actors don't fare as well either. annette bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. as many have noted, joe mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable george raft. only harvey keitel emerged unscathed, but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep. and robert beltran, with just one line, steals one of the big beatty, bening scenes. with these films, i'm never sure if the director is intent on making the mobsters seem like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way. either way, i don't like it. these guys were killers and no matter how much las vegas is indebted to bugsy siegel, i don't think that a movie should be made glorifying the guy, especially one with a big studio backing.

the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. i've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.the acting's all good and the direction very solid. the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. did bugsy really want to kill mussoulini?

it goes without saying that a modicum of allowances has to be made when a true story is being adapted for the big screen. but if you shoot a fairy tale that has next to nothing to do with what actually happened - why call it bugsy and make the audience believe this was a halfway true story? the godfather trilogy processes many real characters and events, once upon a time in america does it, too, but they don't claim to be telling true stories.* spoiler*in the movie, benny has this grand vision of a gambler's eldorado; in real life lansky had to argue him into going to nevada. benny deemed the notion of a counterpart to monte carlo idiotic, and he'd have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in l.a. not until much later benny warmed to the idea. but of course he's the hero of the movie, so naturally the idea had to be his.in the movie, benny wants to use count difrasso to get close to mussolini in order to assassinate him because he was hitler's partner, and hitler killed jews in gas chambers, after all. obviously we're supposed to like benny, so the screenwriters invented this nonsense. in real life, at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers, least of all benny who was completely uninterested in politics. in fact he did use the countess' connection and he did visit mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell explosives to him. he even met goebbels and goering during his sojourn in italy.the whole greenberg subplot was nonsense. greenberg didn't turn stool pigeon, he didn't seek refuge with benny, benny didn't kill him (that was up to albert tannenbaum)... at least they got the name right.i guess it was supposed to be very romantic to have virginia return to benny, offering him the money she had stolen. the movie even goes so far to tell us via text panels that she ruefully returned the money to lansky after benny's assassination. let me just say, revisionism just doesn't get more impudent than this.this list is by no means exhaustive - there's the issue with benny's family not living in l.a, the way benny deals with dragna and adonis, the portrayal of costello (a disagreeable corporate type), lansky (a lovable teddy bear), benny himself (an aging windbag who wouldn't have reached age 12 if he had regularly gone "bugsy" in situations like those in the movie, and what's more, who neither has the good looks nor the charisma of benny siegel) and many others. apart from a few hard facts nothing's right in this flick.* spoilers end here*all in all, this is the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than harlem, ny. but honor where honor is due: this is a feat in itself.

it`s funny how instinct warns you of something . for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was . maybe i`m psychic ?!!!! mild spoilers !!!!the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . i don`t know about you but i`m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it`s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? yeah he`s a serious badass mofo . in fact he`s so bad ( and i don`t mean the acting - i`ll get to that in a moment ) that he`s impossible to take seriously and this is before he`s executed only to return as elton john , elvis , a french chef etc . i wonder if keith david got paid for this ? because he looks lke he`s having so much fun on screen that`s the only reason he`s playing the role . what a pity this reviewer didn`t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury . hey maybe the producers could send me keith`s fee ? gawd only knows i deserve it.i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn`t guessed and my main beef isn`t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . if like me you`ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you`ll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but judge and jury will have you believe that if you`re thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you`ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . it could of course be argued that any film starring sly , arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain

i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, i gave it an extra star just because david keith's gun was cool.

so much for judge and jury, which lives up to its nonsense title. what good is there? the lighting is terribly foggy! another horror movie you ask? well, that's perfectly explainable. david keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns, chefs, and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row. but overall, despite some new twists, it's reasonably stupid. unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently, and this one only means so much. we, the jury, find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time!

if this is not heavily featured on every list of "what not to watch", it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as that remains so, is the acceptable alternative. i'm not kidding you, this is a *bad* "movie". joseph meeker returns from the dead, with various vague, undefined supernatural powers, the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new, increasingly comical-looking and ridiculous(and never scary or creepy... in general, when this goes for the latter of those, it winds up just being bizarre, and attempts at the former just don't work, period) outfits and stereotypes/archetypes, and he is portrayed by david keith(whom i respect in... well, at least daredevil), doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent(which could also have to do with script) and often over the top performance. a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch. the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is(and what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks?). cinematography... oh, dear. framing, coverage, effective use of angle(that one could be attributed some to editing, too, perhaps), please, guys, stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of. as far as the technical side goes, this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film. but why stop there? the plot is just poor. the basic idea's been done, and it's been done so much better than this(the crow would be one). the way it's told is gimmicky, and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks, it still doesn't satisfy. pacing is about non-existent. the lead is distinctly unlikeable, and there's more personality in a barn door, not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden. kelly perine and thomas ian nicholas? what in the name of all that is good and just(pun intended) are you doing in this? perine, you were already funny before this, on the drew carey show, nicholas, well, i haven't seen you in anything preceding american pie, but if nothing else, you *were* funny later on, and in those productions, the amusement was intentional. dialog is... the less said, the better. language is unrestrained, and tends to be stupid. the violence is shoddily done, and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it(hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy). characters, don't get me started. why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting, at times utterly illogical, events? the more you think about this, the worse it gets. it's not even passable as a "bad horror flick", or a b movie(it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet, and go further still), it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine. i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is, and don't say i didn't warn ya. 1/10

before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called "bloody shootout" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls "a hamburger without the fries"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano's life a misery.let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife.director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.

well, i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival. the reaction to it was...let's say as funny as the movie unintetionally is. it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles. they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish. it was all confusing, the genders were switched (girls appeared as boys and boys as girls), and my friends and i remember great lines... but because they were so absurd. all in all not a good movie, but if they ever show it on tv, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie) then go ahead, "visible secret" is your film.

what i miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said. it is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary. a patchwork film without a continuous story. very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. i do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny. many scenes are very unrealistic, and the acting is quite poor. the film is quite boring.

this very forced attempt to fuse robert altman and quentin tarantino (who is wildly overrated himself) is neither informative nor entertaining. the character development is arbitrary and unbelievable -- especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy, as other reviewers have noted. also, a couple of humorous moments aside, the film is not as funny (black humor or otherwise) as the director seems to think it is.

i had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 due to the terrible sound track. i'm pretty sure it was not a problem with me or the tape, because some actors and the sound track sounded great. but most of the actors voices were distorted or garbled beyond recognition, especially for non-brits.there are plenty of cute little twists that would make this an enjoyable movie - ending up in bosnia by mistake is great - but much of the humor was lost in the sound.

as i write this in november 2005 i've become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler - a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . let's have a look at what the brits were producing 1995-2005:funky gangster thrillers . lock stock and two smoking barrales was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy ritchie's style with usually disappointing results romantic comedies . yeah okay i do realise four weddings , notting hill etc were produced by american studios but they're still vaguely " british films " . unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the umpteenth time black comedies . can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is ? in the british context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike leigh's naked jasmin disdar's beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie . filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a serb and one's a croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the balkans at that time , though what's the odds of two former enemies in the balkans bumping into each other on a london bus ? this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie - irony takes precedence over likely situations , you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely ? perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film . it's called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clichéd stereotypical people that i couldn't believe in as three dimensional characters

old bat transforms to younger ok looking girl after drinking a potion. this movie was dreadful. the acting atrocious. the camera work made me head spin. and it features the longest, most excruciatingly boring strip-tease ever put to film. piero vivarelli should be ashamed for directing this. eduardo manzanos brochero should'voe been blacklisted just for writing something so awful.don't rent this movie, the only exception i can this of is maybe if you're dying and only have less then 90 minutes to live, watch this film cause it will feel like an eternity and you'll be begging the grip reaper come a little early.my grade: f

dr. marnie bannister (magda konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. when one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. when she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. the drug works and she becomes beautiful. but the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.have you ever heard the expression "as exciting as watching paint dry"? that pretty much sums up satanik. during the film, one of the characters utters the line, "something so horrible, it's inconceivable." i wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself. i'm really disappointed because i had high hopes for this one. satanik had possibilities, but they're never realized. at every opportunity, the plot has marnie do the dullest things imaginable. the writing is horrible. and part of the problem is magda konopka. she's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own.another big problem with satanik is the direction and editing. it's a mess. we see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie. the camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over. i can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. this group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent.i may not be familiar with the italian comic on which satanik is supposedly based, but i'm sure it's got to be better than this.

deformed, aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal formulae for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process. she takes it and turns into the beautiful, evil satanik (magda konopka) who goes around, seducing and murdering wealthy businessmen.she dresses very stylishly in late-60s mod clothes and manipulates those around her, looking a lot like the late marisa mell from the diabolik film. coincidence??however, in spite of all this, it's amateurish and sloppy without the james bond pop-art gadgetry that diabolik had had. even the madrid and lake geneva filming locations don't make up for this.the soundtrack is by manuel parada & roberto pregadio and it isn't bad at all, consisting of lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an embellishment. perfect for one of those european loungecore cds that came out in the 90s.the retromedia dvd also uses a substandard grainy color print that's in poor shape, with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film. bull ! they either didn't bother looking for a better source or they couldn't find one at all. there are only a few stills of magda and that's it.sloppy & poor all around, this one gets a 3 out of 10.

this spanish-italian co-production tells an interesting and weird story about dr. bannister, a woman that not only has the best years behind her, but also has a scarred face that makes her look like a freak. but in madrid, a professor she knows has conducted some experiments on animals with a substance which regenerates cells. the experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. because the professor won't allow dr. bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. she becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious killer when it comes to keep her secret a secret.the plot of the film is great fun, but piero vivarelli had not enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it. also, the film becomes boring after a good start and doesn't manage to regain a fast pace even though the film's running time doesn't exceed 83 minutes. and as the setting changes to swiss city geneva for the last third of the film, it sometimes even looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful geneva is (which it is indeed - but it doesn't help to push the plot forward...). so, with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "satanik" could have become an obscure italian classic. but, as it is, it's just a lacklustre and boring crime film that isn't really worth looking for. rating: 3 out of 10.

the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal, dramatic character. well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film. in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that pete's meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama. and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot. one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen. i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign. the characters are not much better than a story. despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him. it doesn't work. the same thing with other characters. they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although he wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot. towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity. unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and i'm sure he had) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a weird script. grade: 3 out of 10. those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed.

too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut. this film looks like it was put together by a committee that couldn't decide if it was a comedy, drama, suspense, or sci-fi. it starts out sort of playful, then quickly gets darker, and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something. it's totally weird and impossible to string together. the acting is extremely uneven, with the older professionals engaging your attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play. this movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first-run and art houses. this would be a good film for a film class to analyze. plot, character, theme, consistency - they are all either faulty or missing from this film.

this movie is absolutely horrible! i thought because it had good actors in it like gabrielle union, hill harper, and of course the infamous billy d. williams. the movie is long, and drags on with a documentary style of showing gabrielle union, who has died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who, and who's related to who. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, and i wish i could take it back where i got it from. i fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom. do not waste your time or money on this movie. it could had been more true to life with more drama, and less boredom.

i'm going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because i live in huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. that said, this movie was pretty bad. it's like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it. and billy d. williams looked like he'd rather be anywhere but in this movie. it's just a mess. i think i could write a script better than the dislodge for this film, and i'm no writer.there is one thing i've seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boards--everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war 2 and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late 1950's/early 1960's. while the military was not segregated by then, i'm pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like huntsville, al. if the beginning of film was supposed to be the 1940's, then billy d, lesley ann & rae dawn would have to have been in the 70's and 80's instead of their mid 50's or early 60's.don't waste your time unless you really, really like the actors because the story isn't very interesting.

i's a big struggle. as a story that is surreal, this movie could've been great (as great as it is rated by some here), but mixed with the acting (director and relatives playing major roles, due to financial reasons i reckon) found in here ... although calling this acting, is not only a stretch of that word, it's giving it a new meaning! a whole new meaning! if you are into surreal movies (there are some that i do like actually, see the japanese strange circus for example), you might be able to overlook the flaws (see above) and enjoy this more. there are great ideas here, after all! many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while watching this (with a group of friends) almost all of us, just couldn't stop laughing ... not the intention of the director of course! again, everyone has their own liking, as one can see by the high rating of this movie, but i could only recommend the movie if you're aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done and/or are a fan of his!

such pain! pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. i wouldn't say this straight-to-video south african/canadian/uk horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. it's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. i tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as i couldn't keep my eyes open. even then i couldn't remember where i got up to, which left me watching it from the beginning again. the only thing that hit a chord was andreas poulsson's sharp cinematography of the vast, harsh and eerie desert locations. a nice glossy chic creates a striking visual sense, which can't save the film from that overall empty feeling. everything else is below-par and almost comes off grating. like the head-scratching revelation of the beast. huh. the computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable, and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones. but there's too little, as there's no hiding the fact that the clichéd script wants to ponder on the generic character conflict to build tension and uncertainty. that would be fine if the wilted script was more than just basic, shallow fluff, because it never generated any strong, lasting suspense, but makes it uninterestingly labour on. the lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the dispensable basket. it's your stereotypical bunch. scott bairstow and warrick grier's performances are colourless, and the beautiful rachel shelley tries but looks rather weary.

i think the "bone snatcher" should go after anyone associated with this movie. watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. the plot is boring and stupid. there were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. if you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. i bought this movie based on some other reviews i'd read. i wish i had my money back. what a skunker. if you're looking for a horror movie that will hold your interest, watch "u turn". it may be based on a kooky plot, but it's full of those creepy scenes that keep you jumping from beginning to end.

a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor, "gold diggers of 1933." the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film's release, so the humour is all of the hokey, wocka-wocka variety and gone are the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film. a cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through the motions here, and the "puttin' on a show" motif seems awfully forced; instead of the make or break world of broadway, the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel. who really cares whether or not the show goes on? the score here is bland too. of course the movie's big number is "lullaby of broadway," which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialite's eventual demise from too much partying--doesn't exactly have the same effect as the searing "forgotten man" number used as the finale in '33. busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film, and whatever promise is built up in the film's fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates. unfortunately, no one learned any lessons from this, and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later.grade: c-

after his widower father dies in a horsing accident, young tom burlinson (as jim craig) is left to manage his australian "snowy river" farm, with only wizened, peg-legged prospector kirk douglas (as spur) to help. times are hard, so mr. burlinson goes to work for mr. douglas' wealthy, silver-haired brother rancher "mr. harrison" (also played by kirk douglas). when a big job comes up, the silver-haired (older?) douglas feels burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go along; so, burlinson stays behind, and falls in love with the boss' daughter, sigrid thornton (as jessica harrison).the least satisfactory aspect of director george miller's "the man from snowy river" is a weak storyline. observe, for example, the "jessica is lost" sequence of events. the damsel gets lost in one of those "freak" storms, while running away. her worried father rounds up a posses of drunk men to find her, after predicting bad weather. damsel "jessica" rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff. father and the suddenly sober men don't check burlinson's farm. hero burlinson discovers the damsel. after building a fire, he decides to kiss her.the "romance" is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as burlinson and ms. thornton. to make matters worse, the douglas brothers have a "dark history" which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter. the main attraction, herein, is the australian scenery.**** the man from snowy river (1982) george miller ~ tom burlinson, kirk douglas, sigrid thornton

dreadful! a friend of mine (who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour) recommended this.it's bobbins. i almost switched it off. it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so.this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business. i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie. less funny than global warming.i'm not normally so vehement, but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive.puerile, plot less, useless tosh.i'd rather eat my feet than watch it again.

...and i bought a vampire motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like norman j.warren's inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like kent bateman's headless eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. a lot of people think troma's terror firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but i'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck. then there's john carpenter's dark star. yes, it's quaint, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film it's only two notches above worthless. this no-budget british black comedy-horror outing tries to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to its fellow shoestring splatter flicks (among them psychomania, horror hospital and pretty much anything by pete walker), but due to dismal performances by second-string tv actors (the leading lady looks like amy winehouse), a script that appears to have been written on the back of a peeled beermat by two 'lads' with no understanding of how film comedy works, dean friedman's (intentionally?) dire elevator-rock soundtrack and production values never rising above mediocre, the net result is a film that can only be laughed at, rather than with. if your idea of whoopee is anthropomorphic turds, chinese takeaways called fu king and references to long-forgotten tv ads, you'll enjoy this one, but don't expect too much.

the plot here is simple. country boy, lem (farrell) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, kate (duncan) and marries her, bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman-hungry reapers. there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here. the courtship, taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant, consume the first half hour and are lethargically paced. lem is so weak he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is propositioned by mac (richard alexander) , one of the reapers, to come away with him. duncan and alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler, which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from murnau. farrell's character has no backbone so we wind up rooting for a "real man" (mac) to take kate away from it all. with audience sympathy skewed, the film loses its narrative progression. the father's conversion at film's end is unrealistic and unbelievable, making for a contrived denouement. this film is for fans of the stars and the director only - general audiences need not bother.

***big spoilers!*** "flesh feast" of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great veronica lake's career. this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker, and rightly so, i must say. as a huge fan of low-budget horror/exploitation, especially from the 70s, i nonetheless chose to watch this, mainly due to the cool camp-looking picture on this site, but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film. the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled 'flesh feast' containing four films, including sergio martino's "mountain of the cannibal god" and dal tenney's "i eat your skin". what the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "flesh feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite tedious, which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long. also, don't get fooled by the title, the film is not gory at all. yet it is watchable, if only for its trashiness and, especially, the extremely stupid, but therefore somewhat entertaining ending. the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesh-eating maggots (don't ask how). a bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a 'mysterious' commander. after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself. it was quite obvious before, but i still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious... this is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like veronika lake. except for lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero-budget production like this. bad performances, however, are something i can easily forgive in films like this one. what i can not forgive, though, is extreme boredom. the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff, but i would still recommend to skip it.

flesh feast starts at miami airport, ace reporter dan carter (harry kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate ed casey (phil philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from south america where he has been investigating carl schuman (doug foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. schuman meets dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans. the news of cater's death has reached casey & he decides to take the story up himself & do some investigating, well actually he gets his secretary viginia day (marth mischon) to do most of the investigating & just report back to him, lazy bugger. virginia informs casey that they have someone on the inside named kristine (heather hughes) since dr. frederick rents her spare rooms out to nurses, kristine reports back to casey about schuman & dr. frederick's grotesque youth restoration experiments involving human flesh & specially cultivated maggots...co written, co-produced & directed by brad f. grinter flesh feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts. first lets start with the script by grinter & thomas casey who was also responsible for the cinematography (you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job), basically it's terrible. the character's are one dimensional idiots & have no personality, i didn't like anyone in this film. for what it's worth i quite like some of the ideas here, the flesh-eating maggots, the basement laboratory, stealing bodies from a hospital & that unforgettable 'twist' ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own. unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written, stiff & unnatural sounding it's untrue, i mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they "won't let us out of the house" which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking outside in the garden to someone. no thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh-eating maggots are able to restore youth, in fact at one point near the end when questioned about this very thing dr. frederick claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either! even at an extremely short 68 minutes long flesh feast is very slow & dull, the poor editing doesn't help with scenes & shots lasting for far too long, for example there is a scene in which an ambulance pulls up outside a hospital, drives up to the doors, the guy gets out, he walks to the back doors & opens them etc. etc. did we really need to see every single detail? there is also another sequence in which dr. frederick enters room & puts some gloves on, then she takes them off walks into the opposite room & puts another pair on! i personally think that grinter probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up. i do like that bizarre ending though, i really do. technically flesh feast is complete crap, i'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small, very small. just about the entire film takes place in one house, dr. frederick's laboratory consists of a table, some plastic beakers & test tubes, some ancient looking electronic medical equipment & a strange screen with funny colours on it (don't ask). the cinematography is poor, the music sucks & the entire film looks dubbed, badly dubbed too. the exploitation elements are also disappointing, there are a few maggot shots but they don't actually do anything other than wriggle a bit, there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg sawn off & a ok looking dismembered corpse & limbs hanging on hooks. the acting is awful from everyone concerned, & i mean really bad which makes the rubbishy dialogue even worse. do yourself a favour & avoid flesh feast, yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments & that ending is, well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film-making that quickly becomes painful to watch. i doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting, i can tolerate just about anything but even i considered switching it off. definitely one to avoid, you'll be pleased you did & if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned!

once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named veronica lake. a beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, hollywood pictures. fast forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. now a hasbeen, miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(?), joan crawford, and bette davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable horror. but flesh feast? really? she couldn't have possibly been that washed up. to put it delicately, flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage, possibly one of the top 5 worst films i've ever seen, and i've seen them all. lake plays a scientist, who is plotting, with nazi's, to bring hitler back to life, with youth restoration experiments involving maggots, that's right, maggots. unless you're a huge fan of heather hughes, run away and never look back!! i know very little about this veronica lake person, as well as 40's flicks, but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal, is actually pretty sad. flesh feast is almost impossible to get through, and by almost, i mean absolutely. directed by brad grinter, director of nudist camp pictures, and the man who, coincidentally brought us the greatest b-movie ever made, blood freak, just a couple years later. one has to wonder, is this what blood freak would have been like if grinter hadn't co-directed with steve hawkes? if so, then god bless steve hawkes. you wouldn't think that a religious, dope-blood craving, turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving maggots and hitler, but it really, really is. so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. fast forward a couple years later, veronica lake dies of hepititas, broke, and forgotten. the end. i hate you, flesh feast. 1/10

in the 1940s, veronica lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. she starred opposite big names like alan ladd and fredric march, scoring screen successes in films like "this gun for hire" and "i married a witch". she held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in "so proudly we hail". but changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over. with two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future) veronica headed for new york city, where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight. it was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties. but by now, her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks. without them, public interest in her soon faded again. she did return to the stage in assorted vehicles, but her success was minimal. eventually, she relocated to miami, florida, where she lived in relative obscurity. in 1966 she went to canada for a part in an obscure movie called "footsteps in the snow" which had no u.s. release. the following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature. they approached her to star in their film "time is terror" and convinced her to invest in the project. as one author put it, "if ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown, this was it". surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values, she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this miami, florida shot quickie. looking utterly ordinary in long shots, and luridly aged in close-ups, poor veronica didn't act so much as walk through her part. as a deranged doctor, who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula, using flesh-eating maggots!, she looks both bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad-lib while she struggles gamefully to don a pair of rubber gloves. the supporting cast is no help at all, merely advancing the plot by talking it to death. director brad grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them, no need for anything resembling entertainment (there is, admittedly, one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective/nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that predates ''weekend at bernie's'' by almost 20 years.) according to veronica herself, the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed. but in 1970, the production company scraped it together, changed the title to "flesh feast", and released it to cash in on lake's just published biography. and, because former leading ladies such as bette davis, joan crawford and olivia de havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies, this travesty was promoted as veronica's "comeback film". this seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue, though, because it's unlikely that the (young) audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who veronica lake was. as expected, it did nothing for veronica's career, and she died in poverty, three years later. a previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory (overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) enlists the help of a multi-talented chauffeur to cut up the body parts. "poor mrs. lustig," she sighs, "i hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science." "try not to think about it," advises the chauffeur, sawing away. "i guess you are right, hans." concludes the detective/nurse, "what is done is done." what a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star.

since i was just finishing the book, `mrs. dalloway' by virginia woolf, i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. what i encountered, however, is a film that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensical. one cannot entirely blame the film, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is virginia woolf, and is almost entirely written in stream-of-conscience style with extended periods of internalizing and little actual dialogue, one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it. vanessa redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor do any of the other actors. it is just simply a film that could not intelligibly be made from the story that woolfe wrote, and should not have even been attempted. don't watch the movie, read the book. --shelly

i kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. it just meandered along to the end. none of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. it was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine. if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it certainly is well-hidden or i am very dense, which i doubt.

i couldn't believe this was the same director as antonia's line.this film has it all, a boring plot, disjointed flashbacks, a subplot that has nothing to do with the main plot what so ever, and totally uninteresting characters. it was painful to watch. soooo, painful.

hilariously inept - like "she wore a yellow ribbon" remade by five-year-olds.spoilers ahead: despite its title, and the high bodycount, "slaughter trail" is in fact a musical with injun battles instead of dance numbers.if you ever wondered what ed wood might have done with a b-movie budget, this film should answer your question. some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the short-lived cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. but there was definitely some ill-advised skimping on the film's main set, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a norman castle.terry gilkyson, who later wrote the 'the bare necessities' for disney's "the jungle book", supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. one song tells how "horse hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the hoofbeat serenade"...during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol. other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on screen - and even stop to advertise the cinecolor process(!) the script sends ferocious navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio. by the end of the film, what looks like a hundred navajos and cavalrymen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over.) but the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of badguys have been slain. as the singer helpfully informs those of us who weren't paying attention, the navajos ride away, their battle called off. the cavalry captain, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerily waves his appreciation.the direction could most charitably be described as wooden, or more to the point, wood-en. navajos are consistently shot off their horses in pairs -- never just one. virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over. the film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in hollywood, who crouch before dropping off a one-story roof (and still fail to stick the landing) or turn to look behind them as they slide, "dead", down a rocky slope.the star is brian donlevy, who surely deserves an oscar for not blushing. after the endless final battle scene -- "climax" is scarcely the word -- he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed, and shrugs, "it could've been a lot worse." trooper andy devine gets to sing and robber/murderer gig young laughs at andy's antics...which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat gig out: "i'd know that laugh anywhere!" and lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work howard hughes could be, recall that as head of rko, hughes was first in line to blacklist original star howard da silva when huac denounced him. it would take hughes another six years to finish running that once-celebrated studio into the ground, but it didn't help things when he insisted on reshooting da silva's every scene for this film, substituting donlevy.it was nearly a decade before da silva was able to work in hollywood again. but all things considered, for getting him out of "slaughter trail", he should have sent hughes a thank-you note.

anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say "fake". "it's never been disproved" also is a weak argument. saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in zambia. no bones of any primates are have been found in the united states or canada. there is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this. the same argument goes for the loch ness monster, ghosts and god.

i saw this movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories that i have about it are : 1. that it was awful. 2. that in one scene linnea quigley applies suntan lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight (it seemed that long anyways). 3. one scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head. in this scene, when the hammer connects, the head smashes like glass. it's quite bad.

the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant/ivory film are all here, but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair. i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor, sally hemmings, has barely a role to play in the proceedings. there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters. nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun. and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. in fact, gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. her role as thomas jefferson's daughter, martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. one moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery. nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits. very disappointing all in all.

a day in the life of a dimwitted cab driver sometime around christmas: the cab driver picks up a fare...they have a 'really insightful' interlude...he drops off the fare...he picks up another fare...another interlude...and so it goes on like this for 90 friggin' minutes...none of it convincing (or interesting) for even one minute...skip it!

this movie would have been alright, indeed probably excellent, if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate. "into the void" is a great song, and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with ozzy osbourne. that should have been at the end of the film, or located in a special feature. the best part of concert dvds is to put them on and let the music play, but "black sabbath: the last supper" is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted. nevertheless, there are a few strengths to this film; the concert footage, when it does play, it excellent. black sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without osbourne and this film captures that well: sabbath basically rocks the fans. the fans, of course, have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live, of course, but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the dvd viewers are burdened with. shame on jeb brien and monica hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! also, shame on wyatt smith for editing the film in such a way.

if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. i can just hear it now, "wait, just wait a second! why don't we follow a cab driver through his entire day! cabbies are funny, and so are the people they meet, and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! harry, you take care of production, joan, you've got materials, brian, you go round up some actors and we'll all meet back here tomorrow to start filming!"the first 90% of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened. at least with no planning whatsoever, there is always the element of surprise to be found. some of jim carrey's movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices. the problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well scripted out, and it pretty much sucks. paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day. we pretty much see what he sees. people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town. he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people. i'll admit, there were a couple of funny bits here and there. a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them, he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home. i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think. for some people, he's just a means of getting from here to there, but for others, his very ordinary words help change the direction of their lives.the last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie, and to a small extent it succeeds. it had a bit of that deathbed repentance feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end, it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes. i wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again. as far as the actors go, paul dillon is it. john cusack, gillian anderson and julianne moore are all in this, for about 30 seconds each, but don't watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed. i will give the other people invovled some credit that it's not your ordinary movie they have produced here, but it wasn't a very good one either. there just wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half. it was a decent effort, but it failed none the same.

i don't know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago, but if you're expecting the events described on the box, forget it... that would have been a good movie. the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter dispair that i took viewing this movie. if you've seen hbo's taxi cab confessions, this is the same thing, only fictional, and not even remotely as interesting. if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver, check out the 20 minute short they run on encore from time to time... it is actually worth watching. i have never, ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this ... thing. boring, boring, boring. it does offer one unique trait, which is this: it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. which would be great, if you actually cared about any of these people. instead i found myself yelling at the screen, weeping like a child, praying for either the end of the movie or my own death. the cab driver himself (though well played, considering) runs through emotions seemingly at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic. sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake. "dammit, i learned all these emotions in acting class, and i'm gonna use them!" now that i've been thinking about it again, i do hate this movie as much as i did!

the girl in lovers' lane: 3 out of 10: homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon. plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus. the girl in lover’s lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope. in fact, it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k, whom rarely notes such things in their riffing, simply cannot avoid it.the film is about two drifters. one a rich kid (lowell brown) running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts, the other is a professional hobo (brett halsey). the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner, a pool hall and a whorehouse. our drifter scholar gets a second look from the diner’s waitress (joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane) who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression.on the surface, this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment. while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing, the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances. the story is slight, but hardly the robot vs. aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot, but relatively competent.it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious. halsey’s over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to commit to the waitress (or at the least get past first base) are telling, and the dozens of glances between him and the kid; a hand on shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other. you don’t have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent.

i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on "mystery science theater" have received a tons of low ratings on imdb. however, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the "mst" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. now i am not saying that "the girl in lover's lane" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 2.1.the film begins with bix and danny meeting. bix is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country. once they blow into a small town, bix needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naive--a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato.along the way, something happens to the self-assured bix--he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him. and, in an odd subplot, jack elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone--yet oddly, the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him. ultimately, however, when elam puts the moves on a girl who bix is falling for, things come to a full boil.overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film--enough to merit a score higher than 2.1. the biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often. considering the minuscule budget, however, it's a watchable little film.

okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an mst3k flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *spoiler alert* the film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named danny meets a bum named bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where bix meets a pretty girl named carrie (who is so very.) now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough. all they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie... carrie loves bix... bix loves carrie... a creepy guy in town lusts for carrie... now, i know what you're thinking... bix fights the creep and ultimately decides to settle down with carrie, and danny returns home, and they all live happily ever after... right? wrong!! because carrie gets murdered by the town creep, because bix is too gay to commit. (there are so many homosexual undertones between danny and bix.) and then, the whole town decides to lynch bix, even though the town creep would've easily been the prime suspect. then, the town creep confesses to killing carrie without much hesitation... (must've felt bad, the poor dope.) then, danny brings bix home with him... that's the film's "happily ever after." sad, huh? all i can say is, thank god for joel and the bots. because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite mst3k episodes.

the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low-budget film. on its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix (brett halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny (lowell brown) and the girl, carrie (joyce meadows), that bix meets who would like to look out for him. nothing overly interesting happens (bix goes out with carrie, bix gets danny out of trouble, carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered. her father blames bix, pulls him out of a jail cell, and just about beats him to death. now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bix.until i read the reviews on imdb, i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and danny's relationship than was really there, but i see now that i'm not alone. it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959. the homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. their living and sleeping arrangements, bix's reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute, bix's inability to commit to carrie, and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he's "brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye. i'm sure they exist, but i can't think of any movies i've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one.as for the movie, i don't know any other way to put this  it's boring. as i wrote earlier, nothing much at all happens for 90% of the run time. the characters are dull and the actors aren't good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark. the lone exception is jack elam. his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching. elam had creepy down pat! but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic. carrie is killed and bix is immediately blamed? what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life? anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night? her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner, yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death? not a lot of logic there. and what about jesse's confession? danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse? real tough guy, huh? why would he confess so easily? and after he confesses, no one thinks to grab him? it's awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off. in any other reality, he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder. the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something i'm not willing to do. overall, i'm giving the girl in lovers lane a 4/10.

a young man, named danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named bix, who agrees to tag along with danny and watch out for him... and his money. they end up in a small town where they meet carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. bix starts seeing carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? he's no good! understand?). meanwhile, the town creep, jesse (played by a perfectly casted jack elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering carrie. danny keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right (because he's loaded with money  he has almost a hundred dollars!) whom bix has to constantly chase away (there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between danny and bix in this flick). eventually, bix and danny decide to leave town but trouble is a-brewing, due to jesse the creep.my review of the movie itself: a terrible, dated "troubled youth" flick from the '50s.my review of the mst3k version of the movie: i've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever. the riffing is dead-on, all the time. except for the somewhat downbeat ending, this movie is easy material for joel and the bots, especially danny's constant screw-ups that bix has to rescue him from. the host segments are pretty good too, especially the segment with the `train song.' hopefully, rhino releases this episode to home video one day.

this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. it's done really cheesily and big stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. but jack elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid jesse (now jerome!). my favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ("you loved her?"). danny, big stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. there's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. joyce meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. and those yellow ruffles (rawr!). oh, and booze is evil according to mr. stupid.this movie's a hoot. watch the mst cover of this and crow's terrific elam homage!

i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re-released on dvd, before you purchase them. that way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down."the buddy holly story" is such a movie.i do not wish to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot, or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses, for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago, when i first began watching it.i had recorded it on the old (monaural) beta machine back in the early 1980s, and liked it so much, that it became a regularly-played favourite. the best part, to my mind, was gary busey's performance as the young buddy, and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.i looked forward to the day when i could have it in ...stereo..., and that is where the disappointment comes in.this dvd version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but i'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch, wishing for it to end.the sound is murky, bordering on the unintelligible, and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old beta tape! despite what you think of the images, or the plot, or the characters, the real draw card here is the music......and if you can't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals, or the backing harmonies, or other ambients, then there's not much left, is there? i'm going to convert my old beta version to (mono) dvd for subsequent viewings, and put this one where it belongs, out with the rubbish! "extinction is the rule, survival is the exception..."

the most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. busey's impersonation of holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear gary busey sing "maybe baby"? typically, the members of the hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (smith and stroud, respectively) instead of as people or even characters. when holly uses a string section, the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as mozart. it's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and "amadeus", about the aforementioned mozart) so worthless. some entertainment can be derived from holly's excellent styles and songs done in a b-variation.

the best part in this movie is the first one, located in sicily, i suppose. crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising. the rest of the story is quite boring. crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique, fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack, leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short. frankly, this is a real overrated movie and crialese is a real overrated director.

***possible spoilers below*** what a long and mostly uninteresting movie! who were these characters? why didn't i care about them? if i'm going to watch a movie for two hours, i'd like to care about somebody or something. we know that salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world. beyond that, though, we learned little about most of his family's hopes, fears, etc., as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.and why was lucy even in this movie? she said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were upon reaching new york. to those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman, however cultured, could not get into this country alone, i say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time. that point could have been made in five minutes, with lucy as a momentary character.more questions: why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? we heard about the brother, and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness. also, how long was the journey from italy to new york? given the conditions on the ship, it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days. (someone said something about seeing land a "week" at one point, but i think that was when they were already en route.) i needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through.the only scene i really liked was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the dock. if you choose to rent this movie, do so with remote in hand; you may want the fast forward button handy.finally, may i suggest that, with the right voice-over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside, people walking, etc.--this movie might have made an interesting public tv documentary.

being a history buff, i rented this movie because of the subject matter. the idea of the ellis island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing. unfortunately, the movie falls flat. much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long stretches. the director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing, but instead, it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie. the characters are also poorly drawn. in the end, we don't really care as much about them as we should. it's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been. i would still like to see a good movie about the american immigrant experience, but this one isn't it.

talk about being boring!i got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the galactic railroad. i expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material. boy, was i wrong.spring and chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. it's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as notgr which is something that i suggest you watch instead. leave this bore alone. if you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. do not pay top dollar.

this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen, it was horribly done it didn't flow it was very choppy, because of that many people didn't understand the movie at all. i had to watch this movie several times before i got an idea about what was happening, ok its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it, for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness, there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing, and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie.

as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles, it is no surprise that, shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles "magical mystery tour," the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie, called "head." both movies are not so much a true story with a plot (though mmt attempted to define a plot) as they are a hodge-podge of skits and snippets, interspersed with music and songs and out-takes."head" has no plot, other than the pre-fab-four trying to break free of "the box" they are in (i.e. the type-casting of being "monkees" and the surrounding commercialism) and yet, always finding themselves back in the box. most skits involve breaks in the "fourth wall" and crossing over into other, seemingly unrelated scenes. filled with anti-vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents, the film bounces around haphazardly- also to be blamed on the multiple directors.the film, like magical mystery tour, is now excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements." phooey. like mmt, it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap.like mmt, "head" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent. it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through, but it is not ironic at all that, like everything else the monkees did, this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first... even when it comes to laying an egg.

at a saturday matinee in my home town. i went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok (it's rated g). i was assaulted by loud music, strange images, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense. we left halfway through because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre. my opinion had changed--it's even worse! basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60s...and has dated badly. i got all the little in-jokes...too bad they weren't funny. the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. some people will love this. i found it frustrating...by the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen.also, all the monkees songs in this movie suck (and i do like them).for ex-hippies only...or if you're stoned. i give this a 1.

very slow, plodding movie with a confusing story line. the movie's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals. ellen barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much-younger peta wilson. not sure what this movie was about.

this contains some spoiler information, but the movie is not worth watching anyway...why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer-director damian harris is beyond me. the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques, which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them. the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all.even more over-the-top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s/m crime belong to a large, yet secret, group of s/m lesbian executives.full of bad editing and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations - including barkin's detective salary apartment. and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep. damian is a bad writer and a bad director. he tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times. furthermore, he couldn't get ellen barkin to give 110%. i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying. standouts were peta wilson, who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part. the highly under-rated character actor, marshall bell gave his absolute best as always.and since damian couldn't deliver on any level, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. most importantly, he doesn't know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical "hollywood reality" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous.save your time, money and braincells and pass this one by.

as much as i love ellen barkin (who is really underrated) i have to boo this movie. if you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho-sexual thriller or have never watched 20/20. it's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway.overall, this movie serves to turn-on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex. not a fun movie to sit through, although if you like ellen barkin it's nice to see her place a tough lady.

this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere. subplots come in and out of nowhere, the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer's motivation is unclear to say the least. maybe they could get away with this in a porn version, but here some more clarification is needed.

mercy the movie, actually starts out as a somewhat decent film, and ellen barkin does give a strong performance. but if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare. it is always hard to brink a book onto film and unfortunatley this one ends up failing...... 3 out of 10

...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. what was the motive? the details of the murders were used, but never explained. i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. there is no thread to follow. i guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.casting is very good, i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky.not much more to say, really. but i really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious.

i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies, but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing. the evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. i started fast forwarding to see how it ended. and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. the main character, played by ellen barkin, just wasn't believable at all. peta wilson acted very well in this film, but her character was way out there and there wasn't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.

the monkees "head" is one of those peculiar phenomenons i've noticed- that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings, which its creator never intended. such is the case here.the movie is a stream-of-consciousness spectacle of the monkees floating in and out of various sketches, blackouts, set pieces, etc. similar to the ones on their tv show. but while the tv show was played for laughs, this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. all in all, it's the monkees doing the same schtick, but now it's "consciousness-raising" because the laugh track is removed. there is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drones on with colored lights.the music in "head" should prove to anyone, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability. the tunes are mostly garbage; the only one that's even listenable is "porpoise song", which opens and closes the film. but the thing is, that was a gerry goffin-carole king song, and, while it's above-average for the monkees, it's below-average by goffin and king standards. it's like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul mccartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then you find out who composed it, and you realize it's a throwaway. mike nesmith's song is maybe passable, the rest is worthless. davy jones has, i guess, what the filmmakers imagined to be "the big number" in the picture, since it's the only song presented as show biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence, but it falls flat, too, just because the song isn't any good.i have to admit i always liked the monkees, so the movie is a real disappointment. sure, they were cheesy, but they were so cheerful about it.they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. but then they got ambitious. in "head", they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product, but the truth is, they wanted something more. they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. maybe not like the beatles, but something approaching that. "head" proves that they failed on all counts. 1* out of 4

this film tried, but ultimately it was a waste of talent. it tried to hard to be "sexy." i'm not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson (who will find something besides tv's "le femme nikita" worthy of her talents.) i just didn't find, even in ms. wilson's so-called near-seduction scene with mrs. barkin any real emotion, even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work. if the sexual elements of wilson's disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart (which it didn't even by an ending it didn't deserve), neither did the murder element of the plot. perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction, but i didn't feel for anyone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie doesn't work for me. if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out: 1.) the gulity pleasure of "bound" which works well in a noir setting; and 2.) the more honest, and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hell's kitchen called "all over me." it's a well-defined indie from the mid-90's that handles that coming-of-age issue with feeling, not forced sexuality. both would be a better rental than "mercy" which has next to nothing.

i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown on the bed with the "missing eyelids", as the camera pans up and away from her face, blinks! yes, blinks! i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things! of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands. very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face. too bad.

i caught this on hbo under its category of "guilty pleasures", and i would agree that i felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. one, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "so what?". however, i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times. do i feel dirty for having watched it? yes. am i sorry i watched it? no. so, there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy, even when in a poor movie. sigh!

first of all, even imdb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is very "gappy". even main characters are missing from it like buddy for example.now back to the movie. i love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. it was horrid. probably the worst movie i have ever seen. and the reason why it bothers me so much, is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.the plot line itself is good. it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting. golden brooks was a huge disappointment. i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud, fun-loving, energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends. melodramatic roles are not for her at all. she basically killed her character, rachel.i love some of the cast, like deborah cox, mel jackson and darrin dewitt henson, but even they couldn't save this catastrophic movie. of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill harper as a man, and he didn't help me get to like him more here either.golden brooks' voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie. it seemed like she whispered throughout the whole joint. the director i won't even waste board-space on, he did such a bad job. the editing, photography/camera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad. not to mention the dialogs! absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious (when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself). as i said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was seriously messed up. i would not recommend it to anyone, unless they are cinematography major and want to see a 'what not to do' example for their future work.have a great day, everyone!!!

i have been a rabid star trek fan since 1966. still am. one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. encounter at farpoint fails in its mission.superbly produced.poorly directed, written, acted. d.c. fontana really blew this one. this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned.the first half of the first season didn't fare much better.

the series does not start as it means to go on. although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. the first ever episode of star trek: the next generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and marina sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually. otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q, and some giant jellyfish. that's right.

this is a poor excuse for a movie. a film noir done by busbee berkeley? please! first, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. yechh. so what turns her from despising him to loving him? along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. it isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. it's truly painful to watch claude rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. a crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. how he ever got talked into taking this job i'll never understand. enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent film experience. it wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life.

i have read several reviews that ask the question, "why was this film made"? i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle, only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end, when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort. so, "why was this film made"? i think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves. this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood, and inspiration with this all male choir, but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table. let me pose this question to you, "do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest"? my answer is yes, and this is where jensen failed. heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from great. jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects. it was great to hear the songs, but over time, those songs seemed dull, overwhelming, and a bit precocious. from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow, i knew that i was hooked, but as the film developed i lost interest. why? jensen never took us, the audience members, to the next level. he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film. was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir? the world may never know.again, i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music, but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created. jensen gave us the music superbly, but it was the characters, the subjects, that i knew nothing about by the end of the film. in the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver's license, we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs, we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth, we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers, and we even had an ex-drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years. did jensen develop these interesting stories at all? nope, he left them on the table. it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it (see the political man who missed his political days), but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing. to me, the music was defined at the beginning of the film, i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men. they were all captivating, yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely.by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary, jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end. without giving the ending away, i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines. instead of being bold outside the lines, he chose to create no moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness, or sadness. jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form. i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway, but for everyone else watching (i.e. me) more was necessarily needed. i wanted to feel for these guys. i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled, or just find themselves loved in their own city. there was no story, mostly in part to no development of the subjects. when you watch modern documentaries (oddly, this film was made in 2001), you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film. you want suspense, realism, and drama, alas, with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort.overall, i must ask the question again, "why was this film made"? my final answer alex, is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth. i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population. with that said, jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film, but he did not create a good documentary. when you make a film of this nature, i feel that you must look within the group, examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart. the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed. again, i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty, but i needed more. with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community, one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us. i want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance routine! grade: ** out of *****

this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show, that's more famous than this one. from what i see none of you haven't mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50's-60's called "secret agent man" the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan (the prisoner,braveheart,ice station zebra,the phantom, etc) a man who was tapped to be the first james bond, but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bond's bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values.this show was done in black and white, and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it,you are missing out on a lot. the character mr. mcgoohan played in "secret agent man" was named drake, and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called "the prisoner". the character he played in "the prisoner" was that of a agent who's identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him. what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service, and on this island the populace don't have names but they are referred to by numbers and patricks character is assigned a number which is "6" it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed this.ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned. it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50's and 60's pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show. you're very wrong about that. it was johnny's and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight. to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid, well in england, it was actually called "danger man" and in the us it was retitled "secret agent man" for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired.granted this current show has little to do with the original, no such main character named drake in this one, and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of "secret agent man". but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series.

i've watched hundreds of kung fu movies and i've heard some good thing about this movie, so i decided to give it a try. what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making i've ever seen.i can't help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie. everyone overacts to the point of stupidity. even conan the barbarian had some civility. this movie just has half-evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self-respect. the narrator's character should've be killed for sucking so much...she really didn't deserve to live til the end. the entire movie was a melodramatic mess, with horrible acting, bad directing and bad action. they should've just rename this movie to 'the stupid one-armed caveman with a blade" here's a question...why do some director use quick cuts for some action movies? answer: to can hide the deficiencies of the actors. nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow. the movie tried so hard to show intensity, but it became almost laughable. please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung-fu movies...or any taste in movies.

this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. it's supposed to be a remake or update of "the one-armed swordsman", by chang cheh. the ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching. the script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, "and i knew then that nothing would ever be the same again..." or "if only i'd known what a heavy price i would have to pay." ugh! and who is that girl who plays sing? someone find her and have her eliminated!! she's awful. if you like chinese martial arts movies, you'd be better off with lau gar leung. this stinks.

i've heard a lot about the inventive camera-work and direction in this movie. i thought both were a messalso some truly terrible acting. the main 'heroine' in the movie is irritating beyond belief and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation. everything she does or says is stupid, and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up. if she could fight, i might forgive heroverall all the women in this movie are stereotypical 'broads' in need of a man to save them. and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits capable of saving no onethis is a poor movie, and i urge you to avoid it. watch something like 'the sword of doom' instead, i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film.

i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new-wave.who wasn't?unfortunately, what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave.a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty. just say no, indeed. in more ways than one. including to watching this film.i couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it. it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether.

black and white satire of a madison avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks. they're headed by putney swope (arnold johnson) who is determined to change things. however he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors. that's about as original as this gets.i'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today. the jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. how is this funny?), cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. it's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. the movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. the ending comes out of nowhere. to make it worse, with the sole exception of johnson, all the acting is bad. antonio fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the arab. this gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) are amusing and there's a rare good line here and there. i heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good. skip it...unless you're in experimental 1960s films.

writer & director robert downey, sr., a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy "putney swope." downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising, but tackles black militant culture, the dynamics in hollywood's portrayal of race, the elite white power structure, and character of corruption in any power struggle. as audacious and ambitious as "putney swope" strives to be, it qualifies as a terrible film, amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity. everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. "putney swope" stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. like most marx brothers movies, the plot is thin, providing an excuse for downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible.the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. before the body has been removed, the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member, putney swope (arnold johnson), since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. swope pink slips all but one of the white executives, surrounds himself with black, pistol packing employees, and renames the firm "truth and soul advertising." swope decides to alter the face of american advertising. he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo, and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swope's militant employees. swope exploits his african-american staff, too, ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. incredibly, swope's conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swope's advertising tactics constitute "a threat to the national security." the high point of this black & white, 85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color. unfortunately, downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. the funniest part of "putney swope" involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with u.s. president mimeo in washington d.c. (pepi hermine), a marihuana-toking midget with a kissinger-like teutonic adviser (larry wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, the borman 6.

one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their "love" of each other. they don't seem to be interested in much but each other, and only passively so. i was left feeling shut out. most of the exterior scenes take place at night, so one can't even enjoy well-lit sights of paris! i gave up after an hour and ten minutes.

this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend. from then on, she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends: jack during the day and joseph during the night.this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget. the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture. there are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances. the wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have much to do, as the actors wear very down to earth clothes, and actually most of the time they are naked anyway.the film is very dialog heavy, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. however, the dialogs sound too composed and awkward. in the beginning of the film, most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says 'me too'. after the frenzy of agreement, the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad.the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful.this film is a great disappointment.

i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish. akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than paris at night?). the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to egon schiele's angst ridden self portraits. yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good goddard and truffaut really are.

this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb. armand assante, once again doing a poor stallone imitation, is ray wellman a ex-con just out on parole. all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy, played by a young marcia gay harden, back. unfortunately for ray, lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot, played by sam neill. further complicating matters is that ray's old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen. ray and elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.what follows is violent and slow, but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future, she's not as polished here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching. almost.rent "fever" (no the title doesn't fit the film) if your a fan of hers, otherwise skip it and be grateful it's stars went on to better things.note-this is a hard "r" flick for language, violence and nudity.

i was expecting "born to kill" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after "dillinger" (an overrated movie but at least better than this). claire trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal, and the action (such as it is) stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling. it's one of those movies in which the supporting players -- notably elisha cook, jr. (whose character's homoerotic itch for tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script) and isabel jewell -- out-act the leads. it also doesn't help that, nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in "psycho," tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have "psycho" tattooed on his forehead. also, there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called "deadlier than the male" -- but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. "born to kill" is a real disappointment from robert wise, who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career.

fellow giallo-fanatics: beware and/or proceed with caution  for this movie isn't exactly what it appears to be. it surely looks like a giallo, with its juicy vhs cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife), rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast (john phillip & fernando rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot. the version i watched is presumably harshly censored  with a running time of barely 77 minutes  but then still there's a severe lack of suspense, character development and most of all sadistic (and typically giallo) carnage. "eyes behind the wall" can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues. it's an interesting effort notwithstanding, because writer/director giuliano petrelli (his only film) clearly attempted to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame. inspired by hitchcock's "rear window", the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound writer. he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road. the tenant, respectively, likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires. wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. then, there's also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. are there any normal characters in the story? well no, of course not! the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography, but none of it ever leads anywhere so it's all just sleaze & sex without significance. there's a truly bizarre twist/revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality. not recommended to fans of italian horror/cult cinema, but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students, to analyze the characters freud-style.

i'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice. the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. the script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why vidal tried to disown it). the direction is worse. most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the "uncut" version). the cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. the movie should've looked a whole lot better. the overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an x-rated movie (guccione called it "paganography") wears thin after the first hour after peter o'toole and john guilgud exit. bob guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid-79's bbc production of i, claudius instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-louise, look somewhere else.

i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. the scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting (tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. john gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet. the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played macro was handsome. the guy who played claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of nero and was certainly at odds with robert graves' picture of claudius. the climactic (?) assassination of caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the domus flaviana that still exists today. there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions. if you want history, read suetonius or tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch passolini's "salo", but by all means stay away from this movie.

"caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "fellini satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the "glory" of ancient rome. but fellini it ain't... first of all it is not as entertaining. far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced mcdowell in the titular role. his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. the portrayals by jay robinson in "the robe" (1953) and david cain-haughton in "emperor caligula" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. as it is, they are little more than cyphers. one example is the role of macro, played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.

starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles, starving children and mutilated palestinians i quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary. 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done. i kept watching and many questions are raised, were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? lots of questions asked... and then dropped. no interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial.. nothing.in short: nothing new from what every swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda.

probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . what do people mean by hard core sex ? the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring traci lords and " big " john holmes ? well anyway this is really poor film , i doubt if i`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . the script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . it truly is an absolutely awful film. you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . yes you read that right , a film set in roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !trivia point. many years ago a pirate copy of the thing ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of caligula meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of caligula of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts . this led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . but having seen the whole of caligula i don`t know what it meant either

the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.it's really rather messy though. fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.the dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. there's also a very prosaic, dare i say it british feel to the filming. i didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. wilkinson and watson support this meta-essay with good performances and john warnaby's ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.i'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10
