how could a film dealing with illegal mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull? well, "border incident" is.no wonder that song and dance man george murphy's career ended not long after this terrible film came out. politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film. the film stereotypes the typical mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dull.the film only picks up in intensity once the identities of murphy and ricardo montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the u.s. and mexico respectively.disappointing at best, we see similar problems in our very own society today.

i just saw this on tcm tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by jean arthur. her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as dietrich and art lund. dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. she being the best thing in this movie. the wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to "get away" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. it seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny. the ending was totally contrived. spoiler ahead: never for a moment did i believe that art lund suddenly fell outta love w/dietrich and then was suddenly madly in love w/arthur. oh, billy. get real! 3 out of 10.

when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry. it completely blew in my opinion. i didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell, let's see. i'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole "i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff, oh noes what is happening, oh its a dream, oh its not a dream, oh wait i see something spooky, oh never mind"-sucky storyline. those sequels don't even require the box to be opened, or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead. the first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place. nothing fantasy, nothing weird, the box got opened boom they came. kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it, first because of uncle frank. then because she had information about the cenobites. this movie at least attempts to stick to all that, even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser. no i'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series. now they are remaking 1, and i don't even think i will watch it. oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed.... again.

this movie is so bad and hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. nothing is good bloodline... a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality. the movie is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. the creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories. pinhead is in the movie...but it isn't pinhead, he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird, and the worse...he talk too much. a thing that i really didn't understand is why the dog from hell????? he can't be a cenobites because he had nothing human. why the dog can be killed by the pressure if the other creature from hell can receive bullets without problems????? bloodline is incoherent with the movie series in many ways. for example pinhead and angelique are old friend in this movie but it's impossible that pinhead met angelique because pinhead is just a soldier from the first world war and angelique is an old demon and she live in paris since sometimes like 200 years.

watched this piece ondemand because the description was kind of outlandish. this film stinks of cocaine, the opening scene alone must have cost at least five figures in blow to film. this is a racist, homophobic piece of garbage that plods along for a good 1hr and 22mins with absolutely no direction. i am a little confused on how this has good reviews here. i won't bother telling you the plot line because as far as i can tell there is no plot. i'm pretty sure everyone showed up to the set everyday did giant lines, dressed loretta switt in plunging necklines to show as much flapjack breastage as possible and yelled action; letting the cast improvise in a cocaine frenzy. much like real beer this movie nearly caused my liver to fail half way through. save your money, and watch 'strange brew' instead.

i kind of like jag. it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. for an outsider (a non american) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.i don´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the tv show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army.i still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.

this movie, which i just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. it's easy to see why. the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel, rather than on their homeless friend richie. cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of coney island. however, writer cryer and director richard schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie. one flashback in a music store, where richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone. but in the end, not much. two many drawn out scenes of annoyance, such as inside the skeeball building. rating 4 out of 10.

i saw this movie when it was first released in 1986. at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available, i.e.; monty python, jim belushi & snl, steve martin, cheech & chong, so i believe that my judgment represents most "sane" individuals.the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new "my little pony" movie that was coming out.this movie was so atrocious that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the initial week run was completed.i'm surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste.don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".

this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. this is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. probably jim varney's worst movie ever. the last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. on the other hand, if you are a die hard jim varney/ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. it does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between. the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collectors item and a must have for your ernest collection. i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago. i believe i paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. and it was the only copy i could find anywhere. even though this is a truly all around horrible movie, it is still a must have if you are a jim varney fan and an ernest movie collector such as i. on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this movie a 2 but thats only because i've never seen a 1 before ;)

my website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. here is an excerpt: "if i were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, i couldn't imagine hell being any worse. jim varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. not a laugh. not one. this is not kamp or gitchy, this is not even mindless. it is evil. do not rent this, it may destroy your dvd player. do not even buy the vhs from a 29-cent clearance bin to use as a blank tape. it is the worst film of all time. period. i mean it. really."

wow... i suspected this one to be bad... but now i find myself just at a loss for words... honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...i'll try to say something anyway...this truly is one unique gem. one of the worst kind.lash la rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? a true stroke of genius, without a doubt.it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone. it happened numerous times with this one.the accents of the actors, man, the accents... and the dialogues i heard them speak... and the acting itself... i just couldn't believe what i was hearing.that fat uncle farting so loudly (when walking up to the house together with his little nephew) for no apparent reason whatsoever...tits! yes, there's titties! and female ass! there's even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beer...that one "stretch his mouth over his face"-kill was the bomb! a true highlight.the comedy-aspects were just totally bonkers. i just couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing. for a while i even thought that they were unintentional, shaking my head in disbelief. but about halfway in the movie, i started to get the bigger picture. guess it took me half a movie to dumb-down half of my brain, to finally get it.i had a really hard time believing this movie... but it's good, really, i think. it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard, opening it and then saying "wooow, look at all the storage space!". and she said it like she meant it. i mean, that's good dialogue and good acting, right?oh, and perhaps needless to say: lash la rue's whip-skills suck major ass in the dark power. it's really sad and pathetic to behold. that's all part of the comedy, of course. or wait, i might be wrong. no, yes, i'm wrong. lash la rue was amazing with the whip! it was the editor's fault. he messed it up, cutting his lashes together and all. or wait, it might have been the camera operator. he filmed from the wrong angles... then why didn't phil smoot say anything? that's it, it's the director's fault.but it's a good movie.i'm just gonna quit talking about it. i have nothing meaningful to say anyway, except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience... some time soon.

ladies and gentlemen, allow us to introduce to you . the toltecs! this ancient latin american tribe, even preceding the aztecs, supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers, yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip! but before you get to see this, however, you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any actual sleaze. in case i haven't made myself entirely clear yet: "the dark power" is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. writer/director phil smoot's intentions were obviously admirable, but he  as well as the rest of the cast & crew  lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent. smoot carefully watched "the evil dead" and other similar demonic-themed movies, and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well. the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house; barely speaking out his last word above a whisper  toltecs. his grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks, including a typically 80's aerobics babe, a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal. soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a hermit, as he was actually the guardian of an ancient toltec burial ground. toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. and, honestly, is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos? as hinted at before already, the first half of "the dark power" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. the clichéd pranks, the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of lash larue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. then, the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. instead of menacing, they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning, when a guy's lips are stretched out over his entire skull, but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless, like when a 9-year-old kid (named cletus!) goes joyriding with his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out. seriously, unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing, i'd advise to skip this film.

wow, what a cheesy movie this is! it starts off looking like it's gonna be a backwoods slasher, with the camera following dogs running through the woods. it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits. we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath. it suddenly gets really cheesy when the "zombie indians" arise from the earth and start terrorising the girls. we even get a samurai indian. this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting. once the indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them for they aren't technically zombies) start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins. this is not a special flick and can't be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends. i can't help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring.

of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst. i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it.the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it.if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time, it is bad.they are making a sequel, so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie, but i don't think it is possible.

i couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a total drag. childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "legally blonde" look like "the usual suspects" and so many coincidences that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. ok, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. well if i were 12, i'd feel insulted. the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla gugino that just stole every scene she was in. sadly, there weren't many. 4/10

all the actors in this film seem bored. they are not really interested in their roles and the dialogue is all delivered in monotone. it's a problem because i think the basic idea for the film is really very sound. i suppose it's just bad direction which leaves the actors drifting.

as kids movie it is great. for the family it just sucks. i was truly hoping for something like the goonies which is a great film for all ages. this movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? alan cummings was however a delight. and why do people compare willy wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the willy wonka song doesnt make this film anything like willy wonka.

my kids enjoyed the movie, but i was bored. there were a few good lines and a handful of funny parts, but the plot was pretty lame and relied on the special effects and gadgets to pull it through. still, it hit the center of the bullseye that it was aiming for: it was good for the kids.

this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie. the most upsetting one was danny trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned.

i am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much i detested this movie. the historical trial of henriette deluzy-desportes and the duc de praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, i feel, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film, the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters. the worst of them were the duc's children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch.in conclusion, this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed.

what an awful movie. full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. it is hard to believe the same guys that wrote the people vs. larry flint and man on the moon wrote this garbage. man, this makes my list of top 10 worst movies of all-time. didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first problem child was bad enough? let alone make a sequel for it!!?? amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released! 1 out of 10 *'s

whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's "cool" to hate, like "manos, the hands of fate" or "the avengers") i ask them, "is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? does anyone utter the line 'i'd rather eat a turd' in that movie?"this movie is way too infantile and moronic for adults, and way too violent and irresponsible for children. is there that much money in the beavis and butt-head demographic to make a series of movies like this? there is a problem child 3, but i haven't seen it. i'd rather eat a turd.

did the first travesty actually make money? this is another sequel (along the lines of another stakeout) that no one asked for. but we've received it anyway. the sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. it's also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) to think i almost felt sorry for ritter, yasbeck, and warden. did they need the money that much?

"problem child" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? i don't think it did. the original movie's only redeeming asset was gilbert gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.i can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. for starters, it just wasn't funny. even when i saw this as a nine-year-old, i didn't sympathize with junior (michael oliver) at all. his character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben (john ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. it also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the u.s. these days) when the one woman ben decides to (almost) marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is.and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate laraine newman come back to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. i also found it strange that she was a white southern débutante whose name was lawanda. that sounds more like an african-american woman's name. but of course, that has nothing to do with why i disliked this movie.i think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. john ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. instead, he came off not only as a wimpy parent, but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, regardless of how well he knew the woman. did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents?in a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character, that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior, completely uncalled for toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). the movie was just a mess, and really doesn't deserve a dvd release if it hasn't been given one already. it should just rot on vhs along with all the other bad, forgettable 90's comedies.

junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. it's the same life because junior hasn't changed one bit. he is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. this time he has a pal named trixie and she is only slightly worse. junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. i thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end. this is a movie for the most immature people. it has diapers, farts, doggy do do, and toilet humor in it. only someone under the age of twelve would find this to be super hilarious. i hope when i have a son, he is exactly like junior.

ten minutes of people spewing gallons of pink vomit. recurring scenes of enormous piles of dog excrement - need one say more???

the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter. aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. in this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated ben (ritter) and his little hellraiser junior (michael oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. ben eventually picks lawanda (played by the most underused original snl-er laraine newman), whose blanche dubois tendencies don't suit junior in the least. to add on to junior's torture, it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet, single mother played by yasbeck, the same actress who played junior's first horrible mother-through-adoption. you can see where the plot goes from here. searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so i guess i'll go with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" gag that makes back to the future's james tolkan one of the many grown-up victims (that guy's always playing school authority figures). jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film, but sadly, there is no appearance from the bow-tie klansma- er, i mean killer (michael richards) that made problem child all the more fun. on a serious note, i'm sure these films, whether abusive parents saw them or no, did wonders for the red-headed children of america. let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption. oh, and dog poop jokes - gotta have dog poop jokes.... shmucks.

the first time i had heard of guest house paridiso was in the, er... "washroom" after having just seen fight club. in each urinal was deposited a small, round black circle. when the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it caused a colour picture to form, with photographs of the two stars and the tag line "you'll p*** yourself laughing". when you'd finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again, waiting to spring it's surprise on the next "victim".okay, maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. in fact, i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, that's a real feat. what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise.i hate to pan guest house paridiso and i am indebted to rik mayall (richard twat) and adrian edmondson (eddie elizabeth ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, be it the invention of the young ones (1982-1984), the sitting room plays of bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, such as rik in the new statesman (1988-1993). in fact, this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special. unfortunately, its an 89 minute film.there's definitely some merit to be had, and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale, which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark, and involved... well, you'll have to see that bit for yourself. yet often the pace is leaden, and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. the two stars (edmondson taking his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he adequately directs) never really get into first gear, mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. indeed, the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. the slight hints of depth seen in the series (richie's effeminate, failed social-climbing for example) are not present here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.the fawlty towers accusation does pass water, complete with drunken chef and unseen, called-for waiter "pasquele", which uncannily rhymes with manuel. some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there, and all the "dead laugh" areas patched up with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago.paridiso's brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humour is funny, and i feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.

i loved all the other don knotts movies, but i never heard much about "how to frame a fig" and now i know why: i can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. this movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them would give this a thumbs down. at best there are brief moments of mild amusement, mostly from don knotts playing the same nervous, underdog persona that made him famous.after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw. we were in complete agreement: the prentiss gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don knotts character.be happy that mr. limpet, reluctant astronaut, shakiest gun and mr. chicken movies are around to enjoy.

doesn't anyone bother to check where this kind of sludge comes from before blathering on about its supposed revelations? ask yourself a question: is my skull an open bucket that i allow anyone to dump their propaganda into? do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb-shelter mentality of pathtofreedom.com before you waste your time with this screed.these sorts of mother earth/people's republic of berkeley urbanite fruitcakes that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn't match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity. else why resort to willful distortion and blatant one-sidedness? pathetic.don't be a sap. take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more 'end of the world' hysteria from it-takes-a-village types with a political agenda that's probably even to the left of your own. mi. moore (rather his unthinking followers) have really opened the floodgates with this kind of one-sided political trash passed off as a *cough* documentary. but apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever-gullible public: "if it's on a movie screen, it must be true." god gave you a brain - act like you know what you're supposed to do with it...

a modern scare film? yep it is..the hippies, peaceniks and environmentalists got together to deliver us a fear film.. i didn't recognize it when watching it only 2 years ago that it was a fear film but that's exactly what it is..there's no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww2 and the same films we made about them.. this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those.. that believe in aliens, 9/11 conspiracy plots, faked moon landings, peak oil and major environmentalism what i can say is this film does push buttons, make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it.. it's a scare film.. so if your scarred get in your houses, lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush provokes the chinese into nuclear war..

the topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban sprawl, public transportation, oil & gas depletion, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc.the problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece. one viewpoint is presented, then hammered upon the viewer over and over. you see the same handful of 'experts' repeatedly making their case. the supposed 'narrator' starts off sounding like a news reporter, but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma.the dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion, but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post-oil society and all that it entails. they paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self-contained local village model; walk to work, shop locally, grow our own food, and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. for them, the post-oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world. it would certainly spell the end of globalization, and better still, the end of walmart. i will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over-touted alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen.i gave it 3 stars because i appreciated the old footage and the premise.

there's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'murder by numers' because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. however, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. the whole thing is pretty much blown by the "cop side" of the story, where sandra bullock and ben chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. although bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. ben chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'birthday girl') as well as chris penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. it's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. bottom line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks.

having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock's performance in miss congeniality, i decided to give murder by numbers a shot. while decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, ms. bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see hope floats, speed 2, 28 days) leave much to be desired. her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character). the two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream "we did it!" chris penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is ben chaplin's token partner/love interest character.***spoilers ahead*** mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid errors (vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene, an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys hanging out together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc. etc) cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers. the ending was strictly "by the numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion. a somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way. * out of ****.

hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do "by the numbers" hollywood thrillers.this is very lightweight john grisham material, crossed with the plot of a tv movie. bullock is cass mayweather, a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers. ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo. not good, when two unbalanced college maladriots (gosling and pitt) decide to send them on a wild goose chase - by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene.fair enough, but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also have to endure a several dull overly-melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history. then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff-side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set. oooh... the atmosphere.watch any episode of csi instead. it's to the point and far more exciting.

the worst film ever made, bar none. give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it. except for the bit where the hard-luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should...that's all.

i've already commented on this film (under the name thelegendarywd). but i see there are others who have commented since. all i can say is: what the f**k!?". i cannot believe that a whole 16 people have commented on this film or even seen this movie. add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews (probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review - seeing as how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet provider... just look at their movie). although i still admit i got a soft spot for this movie. i thought that some of the other people writing about this one might have it confused with another... until i read the reviews... especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box: "the ultimate in frontal lobotomy" (what the f**k is that supposed to mean anyway? "frontal" lobotomy?)... i totally forgot about that until i read it in the review. people, we are a select few... i say we meet once a year to view this film... wait, does anyone still have it? if anyone does have it please contact me... i'm dyin' to get drunk.

i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like 15. i hated it then, and watching it again, just for the hell of it, it's even worse now. you can hear the director and cameraman in the background yelling commands like "zoom, zoom, zoom!!!". the are no special effects, just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain. this is utter crap, and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought. but this was distributed elsewhere and it's just really weird to know that other people have seen it. whoops i need 10 lines....well....this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how no-budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. this sucks. actually, yeah do watch this just to see if you can sit through the worst. if you can make it through this you can make it through anything.

i remembered this awful movie i bought at camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when i was visiting my grandparents. it was a time when i had just discovered movies like re-animator, from beyond, the return of the living dead, and dawn of the dead. i was ready for all the horror/gore genre had to offer.... or so i thought! i was only about 12 years old at the time so i really don't remember it all that well. i remember a psycho running around with a corkscrew killing people, and a couple of cops (i think) who were riding in a car that wasn't actually moving, but being rocked side to side to look like it was... true cinemagic. i also remember it being the worst film i had ever seen up to that point and i promptly threw it in the garbage.something tonight made me think of that movie (i can't believe i actually remembered the name), so i jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. to my surprise... it was! and a full other 5 people have seen it.... amazing. even though i remember hating the film at the time i sort of wish i had kept it hidden away somewhere because i'd love to check it out again for a laugh (it would probably make a good drinking game movie). anyway, i'm glad i'm part of the elite few that's seen this little "treasure". i would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks.... but beware, this is not a recommendation... it is awful... it's just for nostalgia.

for a while it seemed like this show was on 24/7. then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed. all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish, haggish, airheads perfectly. not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said.i doubt these two ladies have souls, and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series. may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls!

well, the episode i just watched had the older "gastineau girl" whining about why people keep mentioning her husband (mr gastineau, a famous american football player apparently). she seems unwilling to accept that he's the only reason she isn't flipping burgers, she married someone famous and that's why she has cameras pointed at her.when challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does, she gave a wonderfully circular reason for why people should pay attention to her: "i work really hard on my reality tv show". then she said "i'm not a celebrity... i'm a personality."i'm not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to, except people who've had all their intelligence removed. it's certainly no role model to anyone except gold-diggers as the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems.

1940's cartoon, banned nowadays probably because of the 'black beauty' gag, in which daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse.the whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters of the books come to life every evening. so we have, among others, the ugly duck (daffy) and the wolf of wallstreet. they wind up in a chase after the wolf tricked daffy with a phony duck (hence the title).and chase is all there is in this little cartoon, that doesn't have any real appeal nowadays. only fun if you're a true fan of the looney tunes i guess...4/10.

i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings. it totally sucked! i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie - even an ok movie. none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind. to varying degrees they were each selfish and mean-spirited - or abused and damaged personalities who hadn't a clue about the spirit of christmas (when this takes place!) i know canadians and like them - but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie. i'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. a colossal waste of time and money. do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was "worth watching." this person probably would enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia, too. don't mean to be unkind but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking. unless they had ulterior motives. maybe s/he was the director or the producer. if so, i'd like to ask them to give me back my money. if your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece of drek - or rent something (anything!) else. i'm running out of good reasons not to rent this film. if i were canadian i'd be ashamed that it's supposed to be a favorite canadian flick. if so, i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great quantities of powerful drugs. yeck!

i had to watch this one for my canadian cinema course and i was told that it was considered to be the "best canadian film." when i watched this i really did not agree, considering i've seen a lot better ones. i understand that there were canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me (as a spectator) it made me not really care what the film was trying to tell me. the plot was too dry. the characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is to emphasize the messages, not to tick off spectators. this film shows a little about the history of quebec. not a very interesting film; it definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal.

explores the frontiers of extreme boredom. life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation. absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank, deadpan, totally uninteresting protagonist. viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of "altered states".in a groundbreaking study, david snowden found that he could predict alzheimer's thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent. those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose. the essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy.now, why did i mention that? perhaps , my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable, autobiographical, contemplative film which shows, in simple direct style, the bleak and stoic life of a small community, living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos.this film became popular at the height of the quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims. tragically, its writer-director was soon diagnosed with alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide.

first, let me make it clear that i'm a big fan of bad sci-fi, especially when it involves gigantic, city-stomping monsters. but this one is so fantastically lame that i can't even like it for being bad. they apparently didn't shave enough money off the budget by skimping on the props (the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized novelty pencil, available at spencer's gifts for about fifteen bucks), they also decided not to outlay for concept or plot. the monster does look okay, in my opinion, but it doesn't have enough interaction with the backgrounds, i.e. not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. the general rule of giant monster movies is: if you don't have a lot of fake-looking buildings to smash, then you'd better have another fake-looking monster to wrestle with. this movie has neither. i can't make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending, but suffice to say the origin of the monster, and the method found to get rid of it, just don't hold water. not even as well as most of these movies. skip it.

this movie stinks. imdb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. the acting is either wooden or over the top; the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes, those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie. i want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole.

i rate movies on this site all the time, but i don't normally write comments. however, in this case, i felt compelled to warn others! this movie is bad! it's probably one of only a dozen movies i have scored as '1 (awful).' i know people say this all the time, but this truly was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it's easily on the bottom ten, anyway.when it comes to horror movies, i have very low standards. i'll overlook all sorts of shoddy film-making for a good scare. but this movie is embarrassingly bad. it looks someone bought a video camera at sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies. (the fact that every single crew member's name appears in the cast list proves this theory, i think.) this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play. it's actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on dvd. the special effects are somewhat effective at times, but are still amateurish at best. the best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera, most of the time. i can't say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along. any and all attempts at humor are lame. this movie is such a colossal waste of time.

did you ever think, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "wow, this is so cool! we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon. i bet it isn't as difficult as it seems"? well, this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003, presumably right after watching sam raimi's "the evil dead" or a similar independent horror classic. this "demon summer", however, is so bad it's embarrassing! these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics, but that nearly doesn't make them talented. i've seen quite a lot lousy b-movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. and it's quite sad to be this open-hearted, because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions. there's pretty much no script at all. a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and, whilst reading some passages of it, one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager-groups: dorks, hot catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. that's about it, except of course for all the obligatory clichés, like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc... the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! they just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. i hate that! some of make-up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk-songs ever. this film should never have been released... i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production, but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element. not even a bit of amateur-nudity, damned!

i understand that the budget was low on this film, but come on this is really terrible film-making. the script is just plain awful and that was the free part. the effects aren't bad, but this film plays out like a conventional r-rated movie with lame scares and cut-away violence rather than a no holds barred unrated gore-fest that was intentionally made for video. who were these guys kidding? like this would have been released in theaters.the acting is terrible. the editing, another free aspect of the film, is beyond amateur, and the plot, as i said before, leaves little to be desired. there's nothing original about the film. gore fans, avoid this one. to the filmmakers: try for something original next time, or stop making movies all together. you're not good at it. people hate a trashy rehash, especially one of such low caliber. avoid! it isn't even worth making fun of.

i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. it has set the standard. i will never again give a movie a 1, unless it was as horrible as this one. i fully agree with the other comments about this film. but, since i'm dutch, i watched it with dutch translation. apparently, they didn't have money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. with sometimes hilarious results.don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs, don't watch demon summer.i was surprised that the actors (wow, i can't believe i just said that.) didn't hold the script (was there any?) in their hands while shooting. i think they also did a good job on... well... uhmm... no, they didn't do a good job at all.

a few bratty kids unwittingly unleash an evil that has lain dormant for the past twenty years and have to reap the ill fortune that comes with that.the campbell brothers' film before this "midnight skater" was fun & their picture after "the red skulls" was all right. so why is "demon summer" so mind-numbingly bad? i really don't know, it is better then their "splatter rampage wrestling" but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringe-worthy and when a 'horror' film is as talky as this one is, that's not a good thing. the story's been done to death in many other better films, so why waste your time on this one? my grade: d-

linda arvidson (as jennie) and harry solter (as frank) are enjoying a romantic tryst, when in walks her father charles inslee; furious, he chases mr. solter out of the house. undaunted, he goes to her balcony and begs her to elope. ms. arvidson is agreeable, and goes to pack. then, burglar george gebhardt arrives to rob the place. though he doesn't get much in the way of booty, thieving gebhardt manages to use arvidson's trunk to escape from the police a contrived comedy. note, during the balcony scene, solter goes off-camera, so burglar gebhardt can enter the house undetected. and, arvidson travels very light, since there appears to be nothing in her heavy trunk; perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau solter? director d.w. griffith, robert harron, and florence lawrence are illustrious extras. ** a calamitous elopement (8/7/08) d.w. griffith ~ george gebhardt, linda arvidson, harry solter

andré roussin was a specialist of what the french call "theatre de boulevard" : plays where you find the eternal triangle:man/wife/(male or female)lover .many of his plays gave elvire popesco some of her best parts on stage....and the great actress was the main reason to watch them,for roussin is not sacha guitry ,by a long shot.the french audience remembers "au theatre ce soir' .still with me? roussin's plays were not made to be filmed.and this one is pretty mediocre material ,even if the screenwriters call lewis carroll to their rescue .i like stewart granger and david niven ,and ava gardner is eye candy .but this might be their worst film ,being crude, predictable -even the native's (bola -bola )intervention is ludicrous- a knockabout farce around a menage à trois on a desert island where granger would be some kind of robinson,niven ,his friday and gardner his girl friday.

this is probably my least favorite episode. i lived in cape girardeau for quite some time. i can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boats, fresh crab or scallops anywhere near missouri. cape girardeau is the only inland cape, it's on the mississippi river. it looked like the license plates were from mississippi, which may explain why there was so much racial tension. missouri and mississippi are 2 completely different states that don't touch one another. there are many roads in and out of town and none of them are route 6 or route 666. this whole inaccuracy was very distracting. also, cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around dean if she was well educated. i did not buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the lengthy love scene. jo was more dean's style.

tommy lee jones was the best woodroe and no one can play woodroe f. call better than he. not only was he the first and best, he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion. it was a bad let-down and i'm surprised i even made myself watch it. i can even begin how how pitiful they made woodroe. i understand he would be old by that time, but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down. the first movie was the best and the only one that i'll ever watch. i hope to god that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without tommy or duval. without them, the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone, including the director. if you plan on making another lonesome dove movie of any kind, take mine and billions of others, don't waste time. continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground. thanks.

i should have known better..the clues were all over imdb.com. this flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record. the cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of joe estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies. etc. suffice it to say, i can't see any reason why anyone would want to see this awful, amateurish attempt at film making. turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies. nuff said.

this was an 1970s-type irreverent comedy, poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills. i didn't mind that but i did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion: two topics which secular filmmakers (meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere) just can't stop trashing. walter matthau plays a scuzzy character, "donald becker," who walks around with a cleric's collar on, which offends me but when has hollywood ever been worried about offending christians?anyway, despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it. dan aykroyd is good at paying a nut-case and donna dixon ("laura rollins") is a knockout. i am sorry she didn't have a bigger role.

tycus is one of the worst films direct to video films that i see ever.i am not amazing that this product does not appearing at the cinema.bad visual effects (the start is dreadful)bad actors (i don´t understand why appear in this film the great dennis hopper)and bad screen without sense.my alternative:armaggedon or twister. sentence for tycus:do not watch this film.

unimpressive and extremely low budget sci-fi without any charm and appeal. even the scenes related with the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot. it's just a bad rip-off of "asteroid" (with annabela sciora) and "deep impact" (with morgan freeman). mr. hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull sci-fi entry.i give this a 2 (two). and don't say i'm not a good guy!

oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting-the-earth film. coming within a year or two of deep impact, armageddon, space cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you'd think people would be burned out on this concept. apparently not, since i rented it, hoping it might not be awful: dennis hopper was in it, after all, and he's a good actor, right?i forgot something important: along with peter o'toole, robert de niro and quite a few other esteemed actors, hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films. not only that, but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes. his performance in tychus is so awful that you expect divine or edith massey to appear in some scenes.i don't know what else to say about this rubbish, other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films, watch deep impact, and then armageddon and space cowboys at a stretch. forget the others altogether. this one really is bottom of the pile.

oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. my lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink. i would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again. painful story line, painful characters and a painful two hours.the best way of describing this movie is a follows:- i would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe.advice is to stay well clear and let your local dustman do you a favour of removing this rubbish.lin, you told me this was good!!!!goodaleebyeload.

'tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go.i can hardly find something good to say about this film. the premises are completely wrong. a comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this.a whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody noticing. when the comet nears earth the news make it to the tv and newspapers hardly a day before the event. and so on, and so on ...neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen. is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast? the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done, and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say. the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this film was made.a total waste of time.

not only that the vhs and dvd cover(at least in europe)show a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie, the acting is so bad, that the movie is crying out for being made fun of. if you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to have some laughs about a movie, that is supposed to be serious, watch tycus and peter onorati, a man who will teach you how to knock over bad guys with empty carton boxes! shame on dennis hopper, following travoltas example by starring in his very own "battlefield earth". for those who want to watch a good movie about the earth being destroyed by a terrible force, please do not choose tycus, but do yourselves a favor and watch "armageddon" for he 20th time!

this is complete crap do not watch the main character is so f u c king concerned that the doc's bomb shelter is not big enough for everyone thus he claims the doc is playing god by saying who lives and who dies all during his 13itching, he kills people without thinking twice and beats people to near death also, the main character is an selfish little a$$ wipe as because of him, the doc who made the shelter died and his friend died. he also killed several no name cops the main character is just a f u c king dumb hillbilly s h i t head that's got no concept of the greater good also, this movie makes no f u c king sense. tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity? (if you say gravity, i will f u c king rape you cause the comet is smaller then the moon and you don't see the moon causing volcano eruptions and earthquakes and avalanches).why does a comet cause atmospheric discharges (the red lightning, also why is it red?) in addition, if you don't know, the f u c king moons been hit by comets thousands of times!!! thats why there's f u c king craters everywhere on the moon. the size of an object needed to shatter the moon into the fragments as portrayed in the movie would require a comet around the size of the moon itself.it takes huge amounts of ke to cause an satellite to explode like that.a goof in this movie is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a disk shaped shock wave. this is incorrect as in space, the explosion should have produced an spherical shock wave. this inaccuracy is also apparent when the comet hits the moon.also, someone tell me why the commander (the person who drives the big old broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? i mean he's just like walking with them to the shelter, then he stops, he salutes the main character.wtf?!?!!?!? the main character is also an ugly @$$hole, he's got a huge forehead and thinning hair. disgusting.stay away from this movie!!!

peter crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. but when the government doesn't believe him (dumb fact #1). he builds a shelter in deep underground and is drawing lots to see who will go. plus is willing to kill to save humanity (dumb fact #2). with millions of dollars of technology, how could a civilian see what nasa could not? plus, the ends justifies the means moral of this story is just plain wrong!!! this movie is improbable and totally unbelievable. what was running through these people minds, why the hell do crap piles like this get the green light? some times i wonder who someone has to **** to get a movie made in this ****ing town.

like many others, i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time. i was sadly mistaken. everything negative said about this flic is more than true. what takes the cake however, is the horrible, horrible storyline for the main character.here's why: the planet might be destroyed, the only way to recover from it, for the entire human race to be saved trough it, is to get as many smart, capable, nice, competent people into an underground hide-out. and dennis hopper is the lone seer/scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst, and who has realized this. but what's the main motivation of stevens (sonny d'angelo)?? he's angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. the hopper-character was the boy with the finger in the dike, and now stevens is blaming him for 'picking and choosing'??? and if that isn't enough, he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout, because "it isn't fair!?" and.... he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour! oh my god, how stupid can you get?what's also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. i mean, two million in budget, what could have been done with that? think clerks, blair witch, and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. aaaaargh! i count myself lucky that i didn't pay one penny to see this crap, and to sit through the end of this utter, úber-crap, is one the most heroic things i've done this year. it's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...

not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite, but the story was terrible.a scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... then, everyone is upset that he is "playing god".how lame! he built the thing, why is everyone "entitled" to access? totally lame story, don't waste your time!

i found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed.basically, dr. crawford (dennis hopper) has predicted a meteor will hit the earth. the "powers that be" don't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people.jake lowe (peter onorati) is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains. he sets out to investigate.while trying to get into the secret survival shelter jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives. he spends the rest of his time bitching at dr. crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor.i found myself wishing jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself.don't waste your time on this turkey.

this is a disaster-movie, in both meanings of the word. every character, every role, every conversation, every twist, everything in this movie stinks big time. it's a shame to see dennis hopper's talent wasted in this dreadful movie. i can give you 100's of examples but see for yourself.or rather : don't.

horrendous! i'm a teenager and i don't mind teen movies but this is horrible! aaron carter plays this popstar named jd mcqueen and to keep his grades up or something, he works together with the 'nerd', jane whateverherlastnameis. but the 'mean girls' are too predictable and such the clothing most of the girls wear in the movie isn't realistic. how would any of those girls get away with wearing no bra, tube tops and shirts that expose the belly? in high school? at my school, we'd be sent home for something like that.and one part of the movie where jd texts jane, she says 'sleep tight? he must think i'm an idiot! i didn't know texting was so stressful!' how is texting stressful? and how obsessed jane is with jd and how he 'falls' in love with her is very stupid. the dialogue is cheesy and stupid, the acting's terrible. the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little to none.for tweeny-boppers who still love aaron carter, you'll enjoy it. if you're a casual watcher like me, this is not the movie for you

chapter one: once upon a time at a table (1941)in which a german nazi and a french dairy farmer talk at a table for 20 minutes; first in french, then in english.chapter two: three years of inglorious basterds in sixteen minutes... without tables (mostly)in which an american lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man jewish- american commando unit. there are no tables present. cut to adolf hitler, three years later. he is angry at his men's inability to deal with the basterds. hitler does have a table. we return to the basterds in a flashback. again, distinct lack of table-based content. chapter three: german night in paris... at a table... talkingin which a jewish woman who escaped from under the table in chapter one has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema. the jewish woman talks to an actor at a table in a bar. later, the jewish woman, the actor, joseph goebbels and a translator talk at a table in a restaurant. the actor and goebbels talk in german. the translator translates the german into french. the jewish woman replies in french. the translator translates the french into german. goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the jewish woman's cinema. the actor and goebbels leave. the nazi (who talked with the dairy farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in chapter one) arrives. he talks with the jewish woman at the table. he leaves. the jewish woman breaks down; overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table. chapter four: operation table talkingin which austin powers sends a british officer to join the basterds and an actress on a mission to talk in german at a table in a tavern. after 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other. the actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking.chapter five: revenge of the giant tablein which, the basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in italian and suicide bombing the cinema. the nazi takes the actress into a small room where they sit next to a table. a hoe that he found under the table in the tavern fits her so he kills her. then he takes two of the basterds to a big room, where they sit and talk at a table. meanwhile, the cinema burns down, hitler is riddled with bullets and the two basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all.the end

i will never go to another tarantino movie again. the entire film was worthless. my wife and i both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! we, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering "that was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "i should've walked out", "where was the comedy", "that was pathetic", etc. it actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. the only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. i rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. i can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!

i am sorry folks, but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this kindergarten nonsense.so why this verdict?first of all: the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! it is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know. this story could have come out of every little kid's head. it doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. doesn't work. even the previously seen cutbacks that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. second: some guys go to germany and kill nazis. ah really? do they? the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis? a brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the "basterds"? certainly not --> fail and what happens to the terrible nazi-killing basterds? well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...third: any characters? yes one! the only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is chritoph waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. great acting! brad pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by waltz. never seen a such a weak performance by pitt... and the rest? well, some germans you've never seen before and will never see after. when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven basterds i hoped to see something like the "magnificent seven": a group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... i was then very disappointed, when i saw the "inglourious basterds". no details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... but in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the "inglourious basterds" except pitt hardly play any role in this movie...so i was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened...

i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind. i have been a big fan of qt in the past, i think we can all agree he has made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own fundament. this "movie" proves that. it consists of few scenes of the basterds at work. it consists instead mostly of long, tedious, boring stretches of conversation between people that, after a while, you realise you just do not give a stuff about. it's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that qt has been responsible for in the past. the entire movie is anticlimactic. there is no tension - what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care. honestly folks, don't believe the hype. this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it.

previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. this one is from a guy in love with his own writing. it isn't inglorious, its disgusting.i absolutely hated inglorious basterds. the entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. even woody allen knows when to shut the f**k up.this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark, but in other films, i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. here, i couldn't care less. all of quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly jackie brown. but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.is it violent? sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. thankfully, the film was so thin, i didn't even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on msnbc.he's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. but do us a favor qt and spare us the movie.i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.i give it 0 / 10.

seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((the following contains spoiler)) hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole nazi - jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the nazis.

it was tough watching harrison ford obsessing over nothing. kristin scott-thomas should have slapped this guy and told him to take a hike.save your money. don't even bother with a rental fee, unless you need a good nap.

this movie really sucks.just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this baloney about a nice girl (joan woodbury) who gets involved with the 'underworld' because she needs money (and because she's too lazy to take a job from friends after they offer it to her). alan ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but he's nowhere to be found for the first freaking half hour and when he does show up, he stands around like a constipated mannequin. a real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable (as well as stupid) characters to make you wish somebody would shoot anybody, like really fast.bring a pillow.

i couldn't make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir.the plot was confusing, the acting was alright, but the picture quality was awful! though i bought this at a "gansters double pack" (8 movies on two discs) at walmart for $5.50 and when you put the dvd in, it apologizes for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have.the plot was flip flopping everywhere i couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on...then "the end" popped up and the movie was over. what a waste of my time!i say don't waste your money or time on this! or if you too bought that gansters double pack then just skip over this one...2/10

as a young lass, beautiful joan woodbury (as rita adams) was orphaned, after her "stool pigeon" father was shot to death. as a young woman, ms. woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job, as her murdered father's ex-convict status makes woodbury a bad business risk. woodbury rooms with understanding songstress linda ware (as donna andrews), who advises woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends john archer (as bob elliott) and jack la rue (as mickey roman). but, none of her friends can help when woodbury is the victim of a scam, which lands her in prison. upon release, woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money re-titled "gangs, inc.", this is an obviously weak, cheap mobster melodrama. still, it's a lot of fun to watch woodbury work wonders with inferior material. she plays the innocent growing more sophisticated "rita" quite convincingly; and, she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker. woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized hollywood actresses of the past. "paper bullets" also features an early alan ladd (as jimmy kelly aka bill dugan). ms. ware, who sang the hit "an apple for the teacher" with bing crosby, sings a couple of fair '40s numbers nicely. but, mainly, it's woodbury's show.**** paper bullets (1941) phil rosen ~ joan woodbury, linda ware, alan ladd

my question is what was the worst element of this movie? was it the acting? directing? script?. maybe it was the waste of alan ladd and jack larue. larue and, especially, ladd are capable of bringing extreme sinisterness to a role. in this movie, it was hard to tell who the bad guy was. granted, ladd was playing an undercover good guy, but even in his good guy roles, he could be very chilling. so, the net result was a potentially good movie bereft of any feeling of conflict.

this obviously was a pretty low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise had promise, and something more could have been done with it, but the script wasn't that great- the plot is incoherent and seems almost random at times and the dialog is stilted and terrible.basically, a girl's father gets whacked by fellow gangsters, and later she becomes a robber, and wants to avenge his death, and then it goes into a mob protection racket involving corrupt politicians.alan ladd gets top billing but he really plays a very minor role.i have to say i found it mildly entertaining in its archaic b-grade hokiness but it really is shoddy and pathetic.

what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury, who awe-struck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic "algiers", in a leading role. she does well as rita, an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss. her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawford's characters, e.g. mildred pierce, who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower. if you're looking for a film noir classic, better look elsewhere. at several points, it's difficult to know where this story is going. i first got the impression that it was going to encompass rita's plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son. but payback time ended up being only a minor point, and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film, where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption. anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so a second viewing should clear up any haziness. my copy is from a platinum box set called "mobster movies". the picture quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly skipping fragments of dialog. there are eight films in the $5.50 box, making each movie a fair 69 cents. look for anne archer's father, john archer, as rita's childhood friend bob. alan ladd doesn't get much screen time. it's definitely joan woodbury's picture.

i gotta go with my boy allen (who also reviewed this film)...zombie gangbangers (as my copy is entitled - guess they left out the "ninja" part after realizing there isn't a single "ninja" nor reference to ninjas anywhere in the whole f!cking film...) is a total wasted of time. honestly one of the most boring, retarded "films" i've ever had the displeasure of viewing.a hooker is repeatedly (un-graphically) raped by two zombies, and then by a cop (again, un-graphically) when the cop doesn't believe her story. she meets a guy who was beaten up by said zombies and the two try to find a way to seek vengeance on the undead culprits...first off - there is no "gangbanging" (or really other "banging" at all) to be had in zombie ninja gangbangers. i was hoping to at least get some sort of horror/porn hybrid a la porn of the dead, or re-penetrator, or perhaps perverted stories - but no - there was absolutely no sex in this film. at least a bit o' the ol' in-out might have redeemed this boring garbage to some degree, but without it, we get a bunch of poorly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero payoff. i'm all for "trash" films and most other schlock, gore, porn, and exploit material, but this one honestly sucks in every conceivable way. save your time, pass this one up...1/10 (and the one is only for a few brief shots of some sub-par titties...)

this is one cheap looking movie! a stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. she goes to the police who also rape her. she finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'the zombie master'. the fact that stephanie beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film.

this is a cheap-o movie made by al adamson--a man who was perhaps the worst film maker ever--even possibly worse than ed wood, jr.. adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s, 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves, hell's bloody devils, satan's sadists and lash of lust it's obvious he wasn't making shakespeare!! his movies all had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting.here in brain of blood, several stock adamson actors (such as his wife, regina carrol, zandor vorkov and angelo rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in adamson's previous film, dracula versus frankenstein. this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood can't help but look good! sure, the makeup is laughable, the plot dumb (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting is level z, but it's still better than their last film! about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor, midget angelo rossitto actually had a better than usual part--with more dialog and a more important role in the plot--and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times. as for ms. carrol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick. however, it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans--you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light!

in the muslim country of khalid (fictional), its benevolent leader/dictator,reed hadley as amir, is dying of cancer. amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds. his body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death) consisting of his doctor (nigserian) and mohammed, out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant. the surgery is being performed by the disgraced dr. kent taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. one of them is about 3 feet high (master blaster did indeed run barter town) and the other is a mutilated & traumatized 7 foot giant named gor. what could possibly go wrong??did i forget to mention amir's deathbed american, blonde-barbie wife, tracy or that dr. kent has a dungeon with female slave test subjects & delusions of grandeur? how about a brain transplant that didn't take? there is a lot of double-dealing throughout this and people are killed, but i'm not going to lie to you anymore : mission accomplished. the ends justify the means. if you can accept that then you will not have to waste 80 minutes. i hope that is warning enough. don't say i didn't warn you. if you must watch, then don't watch alone and have plenty of medicine standing by.-celluloid rehab

i'm not sure i've ever seen a film as bad as this. awful acting, all over the place plot, terrible special effects. there are some 'so bad its good' moments in here but not really enough to maintain interest. the woman who plays tracey looks hideous. there are some fairly worrying scenes with a dwarf which leave you feeling ever so slightly violated. on the plus side the operation scenes are fairly amusing for the special effects as is the car chase where one car is "trying to force us off the road" without actually making contact. guess the budget didn't stretch to trashing cars. oh and what looks like a postcard of the taj mahal is shown every time they cut to the fictional foreign country.

this film really misses the mark on most fronts. the accents are laughably weak, the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best.they've got a great idea, it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above.the writer seems to think by putting the word f*ck into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard. he's no brick top thats for sure.next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film.it's a crime to compare this to films like the business, lock stock and snatch.

sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie. are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it? i thought the hair,make-up and characters were poor 2 dimensional types. the story is doubtful,especially since all of the main characters are dead,or nearly dead. i think it's not well acted either...what was up with that hair on the main guy in the turtles? it looked glued on badly, and the sideburns looked like they were going to fall off at any moment. it didn't feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bands,and people. i laughed all the way through it,frank zappa looked stupid,so did mama cass, and so did the beatles. they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous. also the other band people like jim morrison,donovan also took a big hit at looking stupid too. kind of terrible,if this is how you remember these people. it's a poor history lesson on music,it's fictional the way it was made.

unlike most reviewers here, i hated this movie, simply because the writer/director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. too many film fans equate 'extreme self-indulgence' to 'film genius!', but i don't buy into that cult of personality. a film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a woody allen film, of course). *spoiler* (which is just as well, save your time...) there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that screams film-school hackism. the poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience  which, first and foremost, is the writer/director. but the rest of the audience should look down on the surly, brutal nature of the porn biz, too. the flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry, looking down on each and every player it could bash. no matter, just love your writer/director. love those four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. but look down on it, too, of course. while the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look, again, dull. partly because of its run time. here is something your auteur hero didn't try: giving the characters dimension. or soul. anything at all to give a hoot about, aside from genius that paul is, of course. but i'm not buying. i don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype. another overlong auteurist hack piece, with fifty times more hype than quality. i know some of you agree. the rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again. not my problem.

the original wasc isn't by any means a must see movie in the genre. in fact, if it weren't for it's chilling first 25 minutes there wouldn't be any logical reason for watching it. the remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick. now, i don't have anything against pg-13 horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame. when you see the pg-13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used for several times. don't even ask for gore or violence. i know that it's not correct to compare both the original wasc and the remake, but i think that it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original. the tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake. not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning. no tension, suspense, thrills...nothing. the movie goes too slow before it gets a little "interesting", and that's when the stranger appears. the chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of "what will happen next?". but that's it. the situations that set up for the climax are predictable, boring, and lack of suspense. the original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie. now, i understand that this is a pg-13 horror movie but, if you pay respect to the original. why change it's most important situation? the children are not supposed to survive! after the ending i felt like this movie was pointless. so the baby sitter was playing cat and mouse with a wacko...that's it?. then, the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid. and worst of all, it means that a sequel may be on the way. camila belle is the best thing about the movie. she delivers a cute, believable performance. she needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans. please, don't watch this movie. some people say that in order to support the horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out. i don't necessary agree. if we ignore movies like wasc then the producers of horror movies will understand that we won't accept crap. we want good horror movies, not lame flicks filled with false scares. watch the original "when a stranger calls" instead because it's first 25 minutes are way better than the whole (pointless) remake.

when a stranger calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like poseidon just over the horizon. director simon west (con air) helms this updated version, with plenty of relative unknown casts, which signals either the death rate is high (it isn't), or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey.clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes, it's primarily made up of two acts. the first, which takes a full one hour, is the setup. our heroine, jill johnson (camilla belle), chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the math), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her. to pay off her debt, she works part time as a babysitter, and looking after the wealthy mandrakis' kids, is her first stint.the huge mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment, as it is where all the action will take place. plenty of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool sized aquarium-pond (to get wet in, for the wet t-shirt treatment), and check this out - motion detector lights, which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows. naturally, prank calls, red herrings are aplenty, which chalks up this act's runtime, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department.there's a minor trend emerging, with actors being the unseen, providing and acting through their voice instead. recent attempts include edward norton in kingdom of heaven, and hugo weaving's v for vendetta. here, lance henriksen does the honours for the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. why? the script doesn't give him much dialogue. most of the phone calls made were of the silent (mind-masturbatory) nature, which i felt was a waste - they could have also casted some unknown instead, and the job will still get done.the second act, where the main action takes place, is too little too late. and the bogeyman, well, is purely a bogeyman. those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed, as basically it's a one -woman show to hold your attention in the first hour (eye candies always succeed), and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time, ala rachel mcadams in red eye. don't expect any form of character development, nor subplots that will engage.the ending tried to be too smart for its own good, and came across as a cheap way to end the movie. there's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie - no scares, no thrills, no enigmatic villain, and plenty of security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only thing it's good for, is to provide a number for 4d.

simon west's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience. starring talented teen camilla belle, when a stanger calls fails to even elicit a shocked, or even surprised face. poor attempts at scaring the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows. the plot follows jill johnson (belle), a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via babysitting. she is invited to work for the night at a house by the river, and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash. but little does she know, a stranger lurks in the house, and constantly harasses johnson via the phone. a pathetic excuse for a film.

this is so overly clichéd you'll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes. the beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone gets killed. this movie would have been better, set on this setting.so, jill johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend issues. i don't see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story.since jill has come home late, her father sends her to babysit for the mandrakis's in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning, another empty house to the side for their son who's at college. ok.after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself, she gets a couple of hang ups. ooh, scary ones. to which her friend comes to the rescue, to come up with a couple of high school lines about 'love' and whatever. friend leaves and goes to her car. to which then, she drops her keys. uhhh...then the music! dumdumdum..! she fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. which of course, doesn't start. how cliché'd is that..? so..she disappears =d jill, alone again. uh. (most of this movie is with her by herself, so there's not much dialog) so more hangups, she calls the police. who say they cant help her, but call back if she has any more problems.so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriends friends are calling. they have been but only once. like thats supposed to be scary much? oh, and did i mention? her friend just now comes on caller id and some creepy man voice comes on. she gets all freaked out and shyt.yeah, so skip that. she see's the light in the house of the mandrakis's son go on. so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in. bleheh.ah its so boring i cant continue!!!!!!!!!

while babysitting at an isolated colorado house, a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone.remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span! so it's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. there's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie. there's a lot of camilla belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares. it all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills. it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since it wimps-out and changes one important plot point from the original. i guess we have the pg-13 rating to thank for that.on the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere, unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub-par. belle's performance is pretty mediocre too.it's just another unimpressive remake.* 1/2 out of ****

full disclosure: i was born in 1967. at first the premise tickled me -- after all, if you were a teenager growing up in the age of reagan, a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three. pop rocks, atari and rock 'em sock 'em robots? loved 'em, not *despite* the fact they were goofy, but *because* they were goofy and silly and fun. but when vh1 decided to make the series "i love last tuesday", i knew enough was enough. goes hal sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic slinkys are? (wait, let me check... hmmm, no. no, it appears he doesn't.) snarky, snotty uber-hip posturing has its place, but enough already!

big fat slob 'uncle buck', played by john (eats-a-lot-of) candy, visits the sane members of his family for a week in order to baby-sit two cute kids (gaby hoffman and maccauley culkin) and a pretty but snobby teenager (jean louisa kelly). the shenanigans begin when buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his blimp of a body. mostly dull, but peppered with two or three funny scenes including buck trying to get a word in edge-wise on the telephone with his angry girlfriend (amy madigan) and his meeting with a very disgusting clown.candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds.

of the four main players in here - john candy, jean kelly, amy madigan and macauley caulkin - the only one i've never heard about (at that time) was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film. well, she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the vhs into the garbage pail. i am referring to kelly in the role of teenage brat, "tia russell." ironically, six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of "rowena morgan" in "mr. holland's opus."candy, as usual, is fun to watch as "buck russell," or the title character, "uncle buck." few actors were better at playing a lovable, hapless slob than candy. i enjoyed his character in here, but i cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once. also, in the first few minutes of the film, the little boy "miles" (cauklin) says the word "g-damn." how bad is that, having a six-year-old kid saying the lord's name in vain on film? these hollywood people are such sickos. no wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up, caulkin being a case in point.

if you are like me and observed the original "benji" phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is, and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974.my judgment is not entirely objective as i tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. on the other hand i have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of "petticoat junction". never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time.benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of mckinney, texas. if this sounds boring you would be advised to give "benji" a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a "benji" fan (if there are still any out there). unlike "my dog skip", "monkey business" or "because of winn-dixie" the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. "big valley's" peter breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame. if one of your children (of any age) appears to be finding "benji" entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

you know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal - in this case, a little dog - is the best actor on the screen! the acting in this film is so bad, so amateurish, by dog got embarrassed watching this. he ("rusty," our golden retreiver) could have done a better job than the people in here.by now this is almost a trite story: kid finds animal, pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the "pet" winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family. sound familiar? i remember this movie being a big hit, but never got around to seeing it until the mid '90s on vhs. i was shocked how bad it was. why so much fuss over a film? was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd? possibly. there wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories. who could resist this cute little dog? not me. but the movie i can resist: it's a grade b storyline with horrible acting. recommended only for small-dog animal lovers and i mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day-and-age.

beloved tale of hero "benji" ("higgins" the dog) who is many different things to many different people. in his busy day "benji" grabs breakfast at the house of two young children, has a chat with an officer of the law, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an aging café owner to start on the day's special. helper to some, amusement to others, he is companion to all.trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home. from here on we know only "benji" can save the day.plot is routine from writer/producer/director joe camp, and he does tend to over do the slow motion effects. audiences though will find it hard to resist the lovable little pooch, and kids of all ages are sure to adore him. cast were never going to be anything but background to "benji".not what you'd call inspired, but fun family fare. academy award nominee for "benji's" theme, "i feel love".saturday, july 13, 1996 - video

a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect. dull, banal film bored the hell out of me. more an idea then a film. i was half way into this 77 minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was. it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character. certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center, there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough. its not. and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it, especially if one has seen the other, better films of a similar ilk (rendition with reese witherspoon for example)

for those of you who have a few kind words for this film, i suspect you didn't see it when it was released as "parts: the clonus horror." it was a dreadfully boring movie. it missed the mark in at least three ways. it wasn't good enough to be scary; it wasn't bad enough to be funny (although mst3k took care of that); and, even in 1979, the plot was unoriginal.earlier contenders are "the resurrection of zachary wheeler" (1971). it's the same idea (clones as spare parts). the movie is entertaining, and it had a fine cast. another is "sleeper" (1973). yes, the woody allen movie. remember the flattened nose? and "clones" (1973). the last two plots aren't as similar to clonus as the first one, but they predate clonus.they are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea, although often, the word "clone" isn't used.

how many english 101 student's versions of 1984 must america endure? "gosh, this is a great book, but kind of a downer. i know, i'll write one just like it where everything works out okay. i'll also replace orwell's old, used up political insights from the thirties with my own insightful, informed opinions form the 1970s. think, think, political insight... evil politicians, i'm a genius! and there will be clones that they make of themselves for some diabolical reason... i'll work on that. it'll work." no it won't, bob sullivan, writer of this story. this really is all you're fault. you could have stopped them early and said, "guys, with our budget and acting abilities, i was thinking more romantic comedy, or we could move away form taking ourselves so seriously and make a campy spoof this tired, familiar genre of movies." did you do that though bob? no you didn't, and you've had 28 years to think about it. i don't mean to be so spiteful. i'm sorry i yelled at you bob. you've obviously had to live with this mistake a lot longer then i have. some blame really should go to ron smith, who helped you adapt the screenplay. he could have stopped you at any time. you were young and naive, and he took advantage of you. now he wrights the plots for video games and you, bob, well who knows what you do. i'm sorry if that sounds harsh bob, but that's the way it is. you were sold upriver by the hollywood hotshots. as if ron wasn't enough, michael bay also saw your movie, and without even asking for rights or anything, added some explosions to your concept and turned it into "the island." that i think is the most disgusting part of all, that with a little eye candy, your script could of easily been good enough for a major hollywood production, which i'd of hated just as much as this movie and not felt sorry for you at all. i'm sorry things worked this way for you bob. ron and michael walked all over you, leaving you a withered shell of a man, who's height of movie writing greatness will be a joke on mystery science theater 3000. don't focus on that though bob, because karma works in mysterious ways, and one day, they'll pay for what they did to poor little bob sullivan.

this film was sourced from my friends mum who worked in a charity shop. she gave it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes. the film itself is a bit rubbish. there are a few notable bits to laugh at like the bit when his girlfriend gets her head drilled into, but in general the film is bland. interstingly when i saw the trailer for "the island" i couldn't help noticing the similarities. clonus may have been the inspiration for that film? all in all don't bother watching this film as it is dull and boring. we enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after it. another sign this film is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case don't actually appear in the film? weird

slooooooow, tepid, poorly produced 70's schlocker made moore cowvincing because of today's headlines; nonetheless, this film is worthy stink-fodder because of uncowvincing acting, absent direction, and silly 70's clothing(sadly, the moocow remembers when adidas clothing was all the rage...). this has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci-fi moovies accowmplished, namely "westworld" and "logan's run". while the premise interesting(rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with richard(tim donnelly), a clone who is at once both boring and irritating. hollow acting by donnelly doesn't help, but fits right in with the rest of the cast. even such b-illuminaries as dick sargent("bewitched" tv series, "ghost with 1,000,000 eyes), keenan wynn("dr. strangelove", "the dark", "laserblast"), and peter graves("beginning of the end", "killers from space", "it conquered the world")provide only the moost tepid performances. produced, directed, and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it's no surprise that "clonus" fails to horrify anyone in the least, much less keep anyone's attention! truth be told, there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock-fans would love - wanna see some realllly bad, funny 70's films, put on anything by greydon clark. "clonus" is no bonus; the moocow says even the mst3k-version is a yawner, so proceed at yer own risk! :=8p

parts: the clonus horror is not that bad of a movie. i have the mst3k version of it on tape and it is hilarious, but its still not the worst film the have ever done. i would go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they have made fun of. the concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. it could have become a classic if it was not so boring and had a bit more excitement. sadly it was botched in production and ended up on mst3k.

the only reason i'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of mystery science theater 3000. the horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act. the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows. no chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him. dick sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil...he was more annoying then anything. peter graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful, his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent. in 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called the island...i personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie. if you want to laugh at this movie get the mst3k episode its really funny...full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable

i'll say this first...the film would've been a 70s sci-fi classic if it had been executed a lot better.that said, let's examine the plot...it starts with peter graves (or is that clarence oveur?) running for president, then cuts to a goofy college campus-like environ full of authoritarians in goofy trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who all act like they're perpetually age 8. it then shows one guy apparently going to america, having a party, then taken to a medical lab where he is drugged, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for steamers packs...okay, actually he's being put on ice so the doctors can extract the organs they need.it then cuts to another dopey man thinking the place he's living in is a bit strange after a beer can (of all plot devices possible) he finds in a river makes him look suspicious (damn those beer cans!). he and some equally stupid love interest of his feel they need to get to the bottom of it all, so he makes her stay behind as he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the way about cloning...and how he's a part of it.he escapes his controllers after being shot some and an old reporter guy helps him find his 'father'--the man he was cloned from. it just so happens he's a clone of the brother of peter graves. after debate about what to do with him and his evidence, he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend (who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid, harmless, and ready to host a talk show according to the sol crew). he is captured and put into cold storage just like his nazi-build retard friend from the beginning of the film.meanwhile, a confrontation at graves' brothers house results in several deaths, including graves'. the reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb. it seems the conspirators have won to some extent...then, peter graves turns out to be able to survive being run through with a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parts, and giving another 'vote for me' speech just as reporters confront him about the cloning thing.definitely mst3k fodder, but on the low end of the spectrum as far as overall badness goes.

parts: the clonus horror is a horror all right. there are of course the bad fashions of the late 70's. there's the really bad acting from dick sargent to peter graves. and then there's the clones themselves. their days mostly consist of running, jumping, cycling, and wrestling with each other. when they're not doing that, they learn about america. not the band america, or the song by neil diamond, but an america where they go on to become part of a greater society. but they're given some strange drug then they have all their bodily fluids drained(general ripper was right!) and they are placed in the freezer and await thanksgiving or christmas when they will be thawed out and roasted at about 450 degrees or so. oops, that's not what happens, but it would've been a lot more interesting than what's shown. mario, of super mario brothers fame, makes a delightful cameo as a doctor who bickers with dick sargent.

this movie was just so utterly horrible that i couldn't get through the entire thing without turning it off, it was just that bad! when i was watching it i kept thinking it looked like some really cheap film made back in the 60's or something with those terrible looking special effects, but then i realized that this was just made in 2001. the dialog and the acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost non-existent. i didn't think anyone would go back to making films that look so cheap and old, i'm not sure if they did that on purpose or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie at all. it really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at a local person's house or something. maybe they thought they were being retro or something but it just comes off looking really cheesy.i really don't know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this.0 out of 5 *'s.

this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seen.however, that is not all that this movie is lacking. this movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, you name it--it's the worst ever.i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbage.i do agree with an earlier post that the "women" were definitely men dressed up in drag, and that did give me a laugh, i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy women.anyway, there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching!to sum it up: horrible acting, horrible script, horrible idea for a movie. an hour and a half of my life i want back right now!!

when i first saw this i thought it was a joke. all i could think was "you get the 8mm camera, i'll get my little brother's monster toys, we'll make a movie!" why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a sci-fi movie like this, it looks like it was made in the early 80's. with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian, a script that was written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop, poverty-row special effects, and to top it off, a director that thought making this crap would make them famous. the end result wasn't spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity. from venus must have been fun to make and i'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie.a 2 out of 10 for a valiant, hopeless effort.

in spite of its high-minded ambitions, zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. it's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist (which i think is what zurlini was attempting). it's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic. despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience in. too much is unintentionally funny (the phony sound of dripping water in drago's quarters, for example, or the silent-movie mugging by some of the actors) or simply confusing (why exactly does drago want to leave the fort the first time?) for the film to succeed as a coherent work.

skip all the subjective "this is a great film" reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox (which includes both versions of this flick) which i'll paraphrase: "to the tune of sci-fi score by george antheil, the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b-movie hell, all photographed by will thompson (who did 'plan 9 from outer space' & 'maniac')." you don't know whether to laugh at the film or with it. so if you like self-produced b or c-grade noir-wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism, this could be for you! otherwise, get a copy of "screamplay", a modern low-budget expressionist masterpiece.

the movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane. to show that she is mentally ill, she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she's "going mad". along the way, she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be orson welles' brother and he later takes a header off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie.this is a strange little film that is very cheaply made--and it sure shows. the film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or some other cheap type of film) and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later. in fact, the narration was the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious i have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over-the-top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it. as a result of these cost-cutting actions, it's not surprising that the film is bad, though the idea of trying to make this sort of film was pretty original. plus, it's very hard to make it through the entire film.

my friends and i have just finished seeing a preview of this new australian film. everyone who was in the cinema agreed, what was the point of this film? there was no good story to follow, the characters were undeveloped, and the plot seemed unmotivated. i find it bizarre that this film, that probably cost in the high millions, got funded and made. it serves no purpose to the drama community, its adds nothing to the palette of australian cinema. it really was a waste of time creating this droll unemotional piece of work and more time really should be spent work-shopping scripts and creating good stories, not creating a mess like this. hugo weaving and rose byrne were ok but severely hampered by a bad script. pia miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were average at best. a true waste of talent. the saving grace was geoffrey simpson acs' cinematography, which like most aussie films, was superb. come on guys, think about it next time please.4/10

recension: angels & demonsthe movie is directed by ron howard. he has had also made famous movies like the da vinci code & cinderella men. he directed also the famous tv-series 24. the most famous actors are tom hanks(the da vinci code,the green mile, forrest gump,) & ewan mcgregor(cassandra's dream, moulin rouge, star wars: the phantom menace,).in the begin i was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. because they changed the father of vittoria vettra(ayelet zurer) in someone else, silvano bentivoglio(camren argenziano). another change is that robert langdon(tom hanks) never goes to the cern. it was nice that they could film on location in the cern.then movie goes on, they are spectacular car races in rome. an i also like the part in chirstian archives very much when they destroy the work of galileo, it was funny. it was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, robert langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get oni found it very stupid that robert langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the camerlengo(ewan mcgregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. in the book he is the real son of the pope.when i should give the best acting performance then i should say pierfrancesco favino who plays inspector olivetti. the worst acting was from the assassin, who was played by nikolaj lie kaas, i think he was underachieving, because in adams apples he played faboulous.i think the whole movie is underachieving because director ron howard made some many stupid changes. i would rate the movie by 4/10.

i'm a historian. this movie is so wrong it hurts. tried to watch with an open mind, but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history, locations, church protocol, et cetera. stop playing to the dumb audience, please. there are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. a little research, all i'm asking. but then again, the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. so basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. i know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.

firstly i loved the book, more so than the more popular da vinci code and although the dvc film was not well received, i liked it and bought the dvd. however, there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again.the film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there.from the very start of the film i was disappointed, in the book robert langdon receives a call and fax from maximilian kohler, director of cern. who finds the body of father (can't remember the name) and then requests langdon to come, using the super fast plane... in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... in the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on, when the camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been maximilian kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and olivetti was shot... (err i think i got this right, but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the film)...there was no love interest between vittoria and robert and in the book she wasn't at cern when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. in the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. in the book vittoria was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the camerlingo. the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm. ok in the book we are led to believe that langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... there was no mention of how vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of vittoria.in all one of the worse films i have seen, i would have left early, but my brain went numb and i lost the use of my legs temporarily. a really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of ron howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! i want my money back!!!

ron howard and his "editors" only had one job to do... follow the guidelines of the book which was "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and highly cinematic in its approach! what they did? they changed everything and i mean everything! what is left is something that has no right being called "angels & daemons"! i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for "this" film.i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless.......

the implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble fr mckenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. mckenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. and, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. i have always used independence day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (us president commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. for such an implausible film, angels and demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the volkswagen? i felt like shouting, "you are going to be blown up". who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? who didn't spot the baddie? technically also, the film was awful. the dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. moreover, many scenes looked like mud. the one redeeming feature was the shots of rome and what looked like the vatican -- an achievement, because i am sure that the vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around st peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. rome is a magic place, and i enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.

why did they not follow the book ... i am really sad and disappointed. i was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. my wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.reasons for the disappointment are: 1) cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that vittoria's father was burned with the first illuminati brand, which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie_ 2) story-line between the (deceased) pope and camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) story-line between langdon and vittoria vetra completely non-existentall-in-all, too flaky storyline, and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it. maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time, when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid)really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations

i went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book. there were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the divinci code. i went to see the divinci code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. it was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. unfortunately, angels and demons disappointed on almost every level. throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. they blow past the various immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. the final illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. in my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the langdon character is all about. overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10

personally, the book was a very well written, amazing, thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me, seeing that it affected the "different" outcome of the movie. there was something to be desired out of this movie, but all in all, it lacked in plot.for someone who has not read the book, i could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, i did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.with major characters missing (such as maximilian kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. the hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the illuminati, however, in the movie, his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand.

it is difficult to imagine how the engaging dan brown novel "angels and demons" could misfire as badly as this film version. here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. due to the spoilers, please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.(1) in the film, there was no love relationship between robert langdon and vittoria vetra. worse still, there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. (2) the breathtaking locations in rome, as described in the novel, were not realized visually in the film. i am aware that director ron howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. but there are superior photographed depictions of rome on the history channel than in this film where the eternal city was presented in eternal stock film footage. the great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. the magnificent bernini sculpture of the "ecstasy of st. teresa" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the west ponente relief in vatican square was not visible at all.(3) the most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved john paul ii. in the novel, the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.(4) one of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, maximilian kohler, director of cern, was cut out of the screenplay.(5) there were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.(6) there were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. this technique worked in "the godfather" films, but ron howard is no gordon willis.(7) the college of cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a southern drawl. this dude would have been more at home on a texas ranch than in the sistine chapel.(8) the crucial relationship of the camerlengo and the deceased pope was not defined in the film. this relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the illuminati to the plot against the church.(9) in the novel, the character of hassassin was an unforgettable villain. in the film, that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. (10) as a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.in the novel, langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the tiber river. in ron howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the tiber.

i'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie, it couldn't happen fast enough. just to end the movie. i don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. it fooled me into a bad night.

i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another. not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end (actually i can't believe we watched it to the end) but i think it is because we couldn't quite believe it.

some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting; but it is indeed far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement.the source from which all the problems stem; the story. aside from one of them people being shot point blank, with a shotgun, in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. nic, the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and that includes asking an evil spirit for help. ce-ce, who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo, is willing to summon killjoy, so long as nic can "hook her up." the acting, while improved, is still horrid. these people couldn't convey emotion out of a paper bag. the script doesn't help them either. stupid lines, and i can only assume no direction from the director. this script was read like shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went.while this movie (if you can call it that at its 80 min. run time (thankfully)) is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.

there is a fantastic song in killjoy 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer. i don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer olimpia fernandez sings 'killjoy, yeah killjoy 2' is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel. the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. this time the cast, including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film. full moon pictures produced this during their 'urban' phase, none of which was very good but none so bad as here.

it would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch killjoy 2, you must have better things to do, washing the car, throwing stones in a stream, but at the same time it's nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is. it's almost a proper film, which a lot more than most straight-to-dvd sludge can manage. killjoy 2 is helped a great deal by trent haaga's manic turn as the eponymous clown, he throws himself into the role with such fevered abandonment that he almost tips the scales in the movie's favour, but, of course, it takes more than one man in big shoes. tammi sutton gives the most entertaining director cameo since roger corman in creature from the haunted sea and the whole thing is nearly destroyed by the rushed, sugary ending. all over the place and almost good fun.

i have never seen the first killjoy film, and i have also never heard a good thing said about it. so i see killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. starring trent haaga and debbie rochon it boasts. now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out, how can it possibly be bad with these two init? oh how wrong i was. even trent and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is. trent quite frankly stinks as killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one-liners in the history of film. debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough. the kills are terrible as are the gore effects. for example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other. and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history. the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level. avoid like the clap.2/10

one day i thought to myself....what is the worst possible thing that could happen today? i answered my self with a simple," oh, it already happened. i rented killjoy/killjoy 2" on dvd. well, what is there to say? the budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform, the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. there is one funny line that i can remember, and the acting is far worse than the first one. there seems to be no lighting on the "set" (the woods somewhere) and the killer clown known as killjoy (who makes leprechaun look like the exorcist)is less than spectacular. this time, he is not portrayed by angel vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says "child" a lot. somewhere between freddy krueger and a blade of grass... lies this version of killjoy. somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s---t lies killjoy 2. it's badness is underrated. this movie does not have any redeeming qualities, except the song at the very end over the credits... which at leas provides some enjoyment. killjoy 2 is not even really a movie, so much as an exercise in tension. killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie i have ever seen. minor spoiler######### let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. a girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort (maybe an outhouse?) when killjoy peers in through a hole. he has some small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at spencer's gifts) and he does something with them (maybe winds them up?!). then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on imdb). from what i gather of this scene (not from what is shown by the movie) the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in some interesting, but unshown way, and then came back to killjoy. if i were those teeth i would have run. run far from killjoy so he could never ever get his hands on me again. killjoy 2 is hopefully the last killjoy we will have to endure. even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad, i think that this "film" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed. i give it 2/10 - simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move.

killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. honestly, i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie. the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. they didn't. this movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. that clown.... that goddamn clown.... i hate him! i hate him so much! and i don't hate him because he is a good villain... i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief! i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable. the last thing we need is a killjoy 3.

i really don't know why i agreed to watch this movie, but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot! i had seen the original killjoy, well i say i have seen it.... i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in 4x speed.to cut a long story short killjoy 2 kicks off where killjoy left off. by this i don't mean the plot, i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness. i have nothing against low budget movies, in fact i kinda enjoy them, they are something different from mega budget blockbusters, but this film is just terrible! the acting is diabolical and the script... well i think you could of given stevie wonder a pen and paper, and he would of produced something much better! this movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed! i didn't make it through this movie anyway, about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain! please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this muck, it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the muck i've seen thats saying a lot! my rating on this movie would be.... nailgun to the head/10

cops logan alexander and debbie rochon escort five black juvenile delinquents cross country and end up stranded out in the sticks when their van breaks down. after a deadly run-in with a racist, white trash bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. one of the teens senselessly uses a spell to call up killjoy, who finally shows up about midway through this bore in a subpar make-up job and bigger, greasier 'fro that looks like it could slide off his head at any moment. he then proceeds to kill off the stupid characters while spouting some of the worst one-liners heard since hee haw was canceled.the acting from the "teens" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the fx stink and it looks a lot cheaper than the first film. although i enjoyed him in his earlier troma films, trent haaga (trying to imitate jim carrey here) is awful and no match for the hyperactive overemoting of angel vargas in killjoy 1 (which at least had a few dumb laughs).yet another nail in the coffin for full moon studios, whose reputation as a fun direct-to-vid franchise has completely vanished since the trancers/puppet master days.

chuck norris stars as danny, a cop who took down a hulking serial killer however when said killer escapes, danny knows he is the only one able to stop the terror. however danny harbors a secret, he knows that it was sheer luck that got the terror arrested and even more luck that danny survived, now a final battle is waged but is danny ready? right there in my description tells what the problem of this movie is. norris is playing a wimpy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. in the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller. in the hands of a norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. also on board is american ninja's steve james and superfly's ron o'neal but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script. also there is hardly any action and i always preferred a norris movie with more fighting and less talking. given the rating on this website, i must not be alone.* out of 4-(bad)

this film could cure sleep disorders, thats how bad it is. the story dragged, and the bad guy is not that scary. you will not even see this one on tbs reruns. this film made me wonder about chuck film choices. he work on a real dog with this one.

this was painful. i made myself watch it until the end, even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot, if there was one. my patience was not rewarded. the ending was even worse than the rest of the film. chucky walks into the hospital with a priest and his concubine says "i do". how vile can one movie be?

well, the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion. yes, chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job. like my friend ryan, i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend. until than, the killer had only killed women. oh, well, i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought. definitly a film you can pass on.

for a norris movie this is pretty tame. for an action movie it is kind of dull, and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed. it was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80's action movies, but come on, the only non-predictable move defies the plot and the set-up of the editing. mainly, it is said rather early on that the killer (jack o'halloran, whom is one of the few slightly known actors) only kills women. yet, he all of a sudden stops his m.o. and kills men, huh?. i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way, but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women?? yet again, i'm sure that there is a reason (i.e. to build suspense), but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior.fans of "renegade" may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor, but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous.

this is simply another bad chuck norris movie. norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. he put the guy away three years before, but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental floss. then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation. irish jack o'halloran is the best thing in this movie, but like in superman ii, he doesn't say a word. somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing. ron o'neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city's mayor and norris' sidekick respectively. the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 1980's. when coupling norris' "serious" acting turn with over-the-top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion, the film becomes a chore to sit through. the build-up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway, but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way. it's yet another disappointment from cannon films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.

"hero and the terror" is a fairly dull thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable plot, and... boring. for a thriller i found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax, as it just seemed to drag along until chuck's wife's baby is born... and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end - which i can hardly remember already even though i only saw the film 10 minutes ago.i give this film 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes.

i picked this film up from the local family video on sale for $1.50, which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good. watching it with 2 friends, neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is. i, strangely, couldn't stop watching it. but this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie.the plot is simple enough and sounds great: chuck norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars. the serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more. serial murder, norris, roundhouse kicks... this sounds like a great film.and some of it is pretty good. the flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a van cascades off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing -- and i learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than chapstick, gun powder and dental floss. but there is plenty wrong with this movie.one: the editor is a moron. when making an action or suspense film, you have to keep the energy moving. there are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie, slowing it down and distracting from the overall story. at least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better. two: the sound guy is a moron. apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound, so most of the dialog is voiced over, killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths. also, the music is far too dramatic in some scenes. three: the casting director is a moron. they cast billy drago as a psychiatrist. billy drago is a great cult actor (from brisco county, the hills have eyes, and others) and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain. his character is so vanilla that drago's skills are wasted. four: the writer is a moron. two plots are in this film - the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between norris and his pregnant girlfriend. every time i saw that woman on screen, i wanted to claw my eyes out. and sure enough, she never figured into the other plot, making her story completely pointless.will i ever watch this again? maybe. but unless they remaster this film at least a dozen times, you never should. not recommended.

when i was young, i was a big fan of chuck norris. i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes. i remember that i really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best. now that i'm a little older, i can say that although it's thoroughly average, i still consider it one of his better films. in an acting stretch for him, norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. serial killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention. in contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies (as well as stalk n' slashers) of 70s and 80s. while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham-fisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck. being a big fan of steve james also, i can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend billy drago, as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role. not great, but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s.

if anyone at national lampoon is reading this please stop the crap your pulling out of your bum, really now! why the hell are you doing movies like these? they're not funny and watching it for the sexual content is a complete waste of time, really. it is such a horrible movie you may want to shoot yourself while your watching it. i am serious here, guys, it makes harol and kumar go to blah blah blah look like an actual good movie (and we all know that h&k is one of the worst movies ever made) it really sucks, it really does. how bad it is? well, even losers that actually like national lampoon shall hate this movie...they'll want to murder the director, i swear to god. i hate you, national lampoon, die already. die.

i love movies in this genre. beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. so why didn't i like this movie? no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. who's who, where is the money, it's not se7en, just make me laugh. maybe it's me, but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon's movies. this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling, waiting for what's next. instead, i find myself stopping to think, "why did they keep that scene?" i do not recommend this movie. if you are expecting van wilder, think again. the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generously.

this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie. it had a dude from "detroit rock city", a girl from "the cosby show", that dork that kissed the chick and bought that sausage was in "sorority boys" and there was more. ok that doesn't make a bad movie in itself, that was just something i noticed. the whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up.....shocking enough.......you called it. and the purse thing, that was just plain stupid. it was so bad that i watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark. if you are watching this and expect "van wilder" or a movie like that......don't.

this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen. the only concessions is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on dvd from the video store. simply - no plot worth mentioning (i only watched it 5 minutes ago and already i have forgotten), annoying characters played poorly by two-bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy i am still waiting to laugh. in fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was truly awful.put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and i warn others to not waste their time. a travesty of the national lampoon name , rating 0/10.

look at the all the positive user comments of this movie, then check to see how often each one posts user comments. they post once. it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro-movie comments on imdb.this movie was awful. the plot was stupid. the acting was poor. the jokes weren't even funny. the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters.it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny. there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and spreading rumors. this isn't even done well. every joke is obvious and you see it coming.the movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching.i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and distributor for 1.5 hrs they stole from me i would.

a stupid teen supposed comedy that revolves a serious of misunderstanding including (but not limited to) a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student, girlfriend beating, a girl loving a gay guy, and the straight guy that loves her, and bitchy gossipers. none of the following is funny or even amusing. nation lampoon's use to be hilarious back in the day. now the name is sadly synonymous with crap. and this one is no exception. i use to think topenga was kinda cute when she was on "boy meets world", but it seems she let herself go (and yes i know she has a name, but into she does anything else worthwhile, she'll stay as topenga) my grade: deye candy: kati lohmann gets topless; boti bliss relies on a body double (booooo!!!)

the breadth & height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me. about a week ago i posted a commentary on the 1926 silent epic maciste in hell referring to it as "staggering". then i encountered the pollonia bros. blood red planet. wow ...it's all about the scale of the thinking behind it. the pollonia bros. and colleague john mcbride were thinking so big that the musings of arthur c. clark & stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odessey is lucky it was released thirty-two years before this sweetheart. as a matter of fact, kubrick had it easy with modelers, a budget, actual actors and major studio backing for his little "star trek" ripoff, and all that arthur c. clarke had to do was write the damn thing. what's so hard about muscling around a typewriter? the pollonia brothers on the other hand had to think radical, outside of the box, and quickly. they recruited a half dozen of their friends & colleagues -- including a hot lookin' chick -- bought a bunch of colored lightbulbs, raided old office supply dumps for every keyboard, monitor and hands-free phone headset they could find, got everybody identical black turtlenecks, made off with every cupcake tin in the county, learned enough 3d modeling & texture skinning to animate a couple of space ship fly-bys, spent a couple hours drumming up a script, executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since that horrible little monster jabba the hut carried around with him was fried by r2d2, spent literally days working with a vhs camera and an amiga to shoot & edit their film, and came up winners. this is the best d.i.y. direct to home video fan movie space epic i've ever seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent & resources at the disposal of the filmmakers dwarfs even logans run or battlestar: galactica (the original series) as being a chilling look at our future, right down to a newscaster wearing a mis-matched, ill-fitting 2nd hand suit. as a species, we are doomed.seriously for a minute, though, it is a vast improvement upon such later epics as the dinosaur chronicals or preyalien: alien predators, which is funny since it was made before either of those masterpieces. somewhere along the lines the pollonia's started taking it easy on themselves: this film is executed with a certain conviction that gets you to believe that you really can breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker squirt bottles. and the scene where the alien beast consumes a miniaturized crew member made me immediately think of where i'd seen that before: godzilla vs. the sea monster, where the giant rampaging monster crab skewers two canoers and eats them on camera. that made me cry when i was a kid.this made me cry as an adult because here i am wasting my time trying to be some sort of critic or writer or writer/critic and these guys get to have all the fun, actually making a real feature length sci-fi epic with lots of cool colored lights, a hot chick and a talking slide projector named kal. one of the flight crew even gets to wear his black space baseball cap backwards & glower with his goatee like that clown from metallica. is this supposed to be a joke? no. it is an epic statement about humanity, from humanity and for humanity that deserves to be seen by anybody who has the capability to not take any of it too seriously. look for it on a 2 disc box set called galaxy of terror in your favorite discount retailer's cutout dvd bins, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "yeah, they have a couple box sets of our movies for sale at best buy." 4/10: anyone lacking in a sense of humor might want to try silent running or maybe tron. but someday an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this movie and decide that we actually are not to be messed with. good work, guys!!

this film is a hodge-podge of various idiotic cliches. for instance, boy-meets-spoilt-rich-girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college (an over-used backdrop in recent indian commercial films). a male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. the climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films). as with many other recent commercial hindi films, the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else.

"stealing time" actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled "rennie's landing". which explains how director marc fusco was able to afford this cast of now established television/movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. about ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago. its recent distribution by franchise pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs. although not a great addition to anyone's resume, young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind.peter facinelli, ethan embry, scott foley and charlotte ayanna play college friends who do an early "big chill" reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams. unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. yes alec (facinelli) dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery, which are then "cheaply and lamely" staged to completely inappropriate music. it is the least suspenseful bank job since w.c. fields was the guard in "the bank dick". if anyone can point to any moment in "stealing time" where something "actually" happens i would like to know about it, because as far as i can tell, not a thing happens in the whole film. perhaps fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it is too late. like "st. elmo's fire" the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time.i felt fusco was going for a kind of howard hawks young professionals in action "only angels have wings" motif. then again, i'm sure i was reading much too much into the film. after all, things actually happen howard hawks films.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

this movie is a waste of time. though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the movie is sub-par, and has a cliché point. "you never know what's going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." that sentence saves you from wasting hours of your life on this movie. people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before finding that the entire movie was a dream sequence. if the most important part of the movie isn't even going to happen, at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivating. there's a reason this project didn't make a theatrical release, and though indy films can turn out very good, this one does not even come close.

i found this film to be a bit too depressing. i don't mind dramas, but this was a bit too much for me. luckily, there does seem to be somewhat a decent outcome. i suppose it was well done. i'd watch it again, but it's nothing to rave about.

as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing, this is *not*: a film. (cue dramatic music) it's just a so-bad-it's good, totally surreal, jackie chan stunt-for-all. the women fighters are totally kick-butt and jackie is definitely put in his place. this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon -- surrounded by munchies, ready to roar with laughter, cheer on the good guys, boo the bad guys, and continually yell, "what?" when something totally bizarre happens. great fun!!

yet another lo wei production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan, to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action, and plain old-school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue.in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend chin chin from the killer bees, a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home, cao lei (jackie chan) pretends to be a heartless cad, driving her away, and thus saving her from danger.during the attack, cao's relatives are all killed, but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang, whose leader, a scar-faced woman, seems to have the hots for him. cao then goes in search of chin chin, whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend chu chuk.during his quest to find his true love, cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'bloody rain' clan. eventually, after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan (a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry), and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced killer bee (who shows her love by burning his face!), cao ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character: his friend, chu chuk, is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'bloody rain' clan, who has plans to marry chin chin himself.cue the drawn out climactic battle, with cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf.even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through, with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film (with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand!), or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero, but, for most, this film will have very limited appeal.

early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know. this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through hong kong taiwan and mainland china. its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult jackie chan to super stardom. its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie. i was watching it, in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film. honestly i don't think the film is really worth bothering with (there are too many other better variations) except if you're interested in seeing where jackie chan started.

director lo wei was known to read the racing papers and take naps on the set - tells us something about his "approach to film-making, huh? the reviews i've read fall into two categories: 1) this is a film so bad it is funny, or 2) this is a film so bad it is boring.so let's get to the point we all agree on - this film is really bad.i vote for category 2). the story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing. yet lo wei was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it, whether we want to or not.maybe lo wei was upset the day (or two) this film was made - he just wanted to make everybody suffer, cast, crew and audiences alike.spare yourself the agony.

i watched part of the first part of this movie, and tiny little bits of other parts. maybe i'm mistaken, but i don't think this movie is really worth watching. the odd characters and happenings does catch your attention and is rather interesting, but there are bad things in it as well, and some gross things. the magic and mythical side of it turned me off, and for most christians this movie would not be very suitable or worthwhile to watch.

this tatty am dram adaptation scrambles soulessly through the plot of dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior locations with drawings. it's not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when there's neither the time nor money to do it justice. michael hordern's scrooge is far too gentle at the outset, making his transformation lack power, and this isn't helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions. the other actors range from acceptable (clive merrison, paul copley), to non-committal (bernard lee) to seeming like they're about to forget their lines (john le mesurier). it doesn't even score points for effort, to be honest.

when i think bollywood. i think of lite feel good musical dance numbers, with gorgeous outfits on the men and women. and catchy tunes. horror, thrillers, mystery and suspense, don't come to mind though. and this, to my western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. i think it would have been a better movie, shorter even, if the writer and the director had made a definite choice. either gone for outright thriller-horror, comedy-mystery, supernatural-suspense or musical-romance, instead of an awkward mixture of them all. i'll have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen "i know what you did last summer" and tried to give it a bollywood twist. my first film was bride & prejudice. which i thought was acted well. this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese fest.the acting was over the top, at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers, but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying, screaming or fear, it felt out of place. the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera. more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified, we could only snicker a the absurdity. i watch a lot of foreign films, and even though i don't know hindi, i have to say they did a poor job subtitling the film. sometimes it was difficult to read the white lettering against the bright background. the villain was particularly amusing, at least to me, because he came with his own mood music. the supposed surprising twist, actually felt like a cop out.the lead couples were handsome/pretty enough, and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee. i'd suggest it to someone as a musical- comedy, but i'd tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie, because it wasn't worth the effort of reading. if you're determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick, then check out the superior romantic drama 'namasteay, london'. but i was not scared..unless that's really what they think is horrifying in india. 1 out of 10 for what it's being touted as. 6 out of 10 for it's unintentional quickness & ability to illicit lots of laughs, and it's musical/dance numbers. enjoy :)

ramsay  the kings of comedy (or was it horror, whatever) wake after years of hibernation. and yes, i did get scared. no not because of the horror element (of course i am not that squeamish) but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmal-chaap theatre (where else do such movies run).so check the plot. a man is repeatedly stabbed, choked to death, stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool. but he still returns to take revenge. now was the film a thriller or a horror? that itself is the suspense for you to discover. and the end turns out to be another mask mystery. remember those trademark ramsay undercover agents  men wearing some stupid horror masks. only here the mask is of a human. i suppose, no more detailing is required to skip this flick.amarr upadhyay tends to get over-dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between cinema and tv soaps. a cheaply and skimpily dressed aditi gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like .. (uh! you know what).the background score is a straight lift from alfred hitchcock's psycho. not a single department of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth commenting. novelty lacks both in story and execution.dhund certainly fogs your senses.

while it's one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume 1, there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it! the box labels it "hell hole" but the screen title is escape from hell hole. the title is confusingly similar to hell hole (1978) aka "escape from women's hell hole" a group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom, who they easily overpower. no nudity in this or any other scene, however.a woman named cardena drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women. she invites indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle m.g. once they get there, it becomes clear that m.g. wants to take indri's virginity. m.g. runs some sort of house of prostitution, and he's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military, or runs a paramilitary outfit, or prefers for his guards to all wear military-style uniforms.the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison. indri gets sent there. the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards.various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made, but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have: they outnumber the guards vastly, and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or handguns.wip genre enthusiasts may like it, and the fact that it was made in the philippines gives it some novelty, but otherwise... eh.

virginal innocent indri finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless pimp mg. indri winds up incarcerated in mg's private prison after she refuses to make love to him. of course, indri and worldly top con helga join forces and plan to escape. maman firmansyah's blah, uninspired direction and piet burnama's dull, talky script thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality this flick needs in order to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes-behind-bars exploitation junk: the sluggish pace painfully drags throughout, there's no gratuitous female nudity whatsoever (the girls don't even show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene!), the expected torture and degradation are both extremely tame and tepid, the moderate crummy gore likewise fails to impress, and even a ridiculous catfight sequence ain't nothing to get excited about. thomas susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the laughably lousy dubbing, the excruciatingly overlong 102 minute running time, the sappy theme song, and gatot sudarto's cornball score add further abject insult to already appalling injury. only some decent last reel break-out action offers a little relief from the otherwise overly abundant stultifying tedium. a complete yawn-inducing dud.

it was only the second year of the academy but already they were voting politically - jeanne eagels' brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to make do with an oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst performance ever to win - mary pickford's in coquette. the only existing print was a work print without music or final editing, but wherever it's shown, eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling, powerful performance. she is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth (we did after all see her kill the man), we in the audience find ourselves, like the jurors, believing in her innocence, before we suddenly catch ourselves. that is great acting. the film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again. (one silent of jeanne's exists in archive print - man, woman and sin - and her only other talkie, jealousy, is "lost," so this is the only document we have of her. run to see it (when it first came out of the archives to be shown in nyc in the early 70s, the village voice printed a full page review, worshipping the eagels performance).

while it was nice to see a film about older people finding each other and falling in love and the performances by andrews and garner were not bad, this picture poured on the sapp and schmaltz at every turn. every curve in the plot was in view from a mile away!

i'm a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in oz being my all time favourite american tv show . i guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens' bottoms , but i found don siegel's riot in cell block 11 to be rather disappointing . okay i knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language , graphic shankings and gang rape but even so it's a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like each dawn i die and white heat . the problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader dunn being something of a prison reformer . yeah that sounds ridiculous since he's a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary , but that's what he is in essence , he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer . there's also a problem of making a b movie with such radical themes ( quite ironic that siegel would later make dirty harry where the only good criminal is a dead one ) and that is the cast isn't very good with emile meyer as the warder being especially irritating in his performance . like i said a disappointing movie

when i first saw this movie, i said to myself, "hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie, why not rent it?". so yeah, i rented it and went back home to see it. when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shocked.well first of all, no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish, good thing it had subtitles.second, it was nude, nude nude! since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies, you could see my shock when i saw it. *gasp! covering virgin eyes, noo*third, predictable to say the least, but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies, because i don't seem to care if it's predictable, unless it's way over the top. fourth, how heidi and kike were reunited, so cheesy. fifth, how the movie ended. it was a bad, bad ending. how mr. van der linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter, knew how to throw the party... blah, blah. i was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it, the director might have just rushed it. after all of this bashing of the bad stuff, the good stuff's are here to come. the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, heidi's attitude, valentina being poetic with words. what i really also like about it was the song that valentina made with her girl friend. that's all, and for the other stuffs that i haven't mentioned they were just so-so.

adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. she needs to be the center of attention and she'll act stupid to make it so. with her attitude she gets sent to charm school.there she meets the typical characters in today's cinema; the nerd, the clumsy one, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. things happen and in the end adela "learns her lesson" so to speak. the plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state adela is in, but utterly fails to deliver (at least i didn't buy it). so what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. plus the director seems to have a breast fixation, adela flashes her boobies a few times too many, at least i can't see that they are relevant to the story.so the film is ok, but if you are like me and don't like to watch a teenager pissing people off and making a behavioral u-turn in an instant, which i found very unbelievable, think twice before watching.

i can't believe i actually bought this movie! it sucks! ... where i live mexican movies mexican movies are never advertised, or even available ... you can't find them in the regular rental places... so i had to buy it ... i really like mexican movies! they bring me closer to my roots, and my people, and they are way different that what your normally used to... but this one was soo predictable!!! your could guess what was going to happen... i'ts not a horrible movie! it just wasn't worth what i paid for it! jaja... but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah u should watch it.. but if you love mexican movies, and love theater itself then don't watch it it'll be painful! lol

niñas mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera. the acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas, i guess the writer and director has seen too many mexican soap operas and can't conceive anything remotely different. give it up, go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please. stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable mexican film industry. it is not an ok or good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!

why? why? why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible, horrible movie? i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he didn't stopped me from seeing this revolting "comedy". i cant believe i paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste. i'm starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of martha higareda 's nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this ... i will call it "thing" cause call it film is an insult to the mexican film industry. the characters are a huge cliché, the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is... well, i cant believe a human being wrote this. and just when you thought you've been tortured enough...the last half hour is so painful that i wished to ripped my eyes out. the only good thing i can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes (that would feel like centuries, but still). really, avoid the pain!!!

makes "invasion usa" look like "apocalypse now". this one can only be recommended to us skinheads, john birch supporters or militia members. the message is very simple : let's shoot them all - gooks, commies, latinos, everything that isn't american.besides, this is badly acted, badly scripted, badly interpreted, incredibly stupid but no fun at all. this movie could be used as a toorture device by cia torturers. oops, sorry, there can't be any us torturers because they are the good

with no dead heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. william sanders is saved by his buddy harry cotter during an extraction in vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. fast forward ten years and harry is now a brainwashed russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. his new russian superior is ivan played to the obscene hilt by nick nicholson who might i add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in kentucky with his stained teeth. what is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film. soon william is re-recruited by the cia to hunt harry down. he teams up with barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated ivan's el salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of south america. some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. one such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by william and barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music i've ever heard. who would strip completely nude in the middle of a south american jungle? there is a rape scene that uses the end theme from blood on satan's claw as well. no dead heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. in one scene harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. i had to rewind it and count. hard to find film that has recently gotten the full hd treatment by mgm. track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.

addle-brained stupidity that the cartoon "bullwinkle" made fun of a quarter-century beforehand, no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie (the manchurian candidate) without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder. the acting barely registers on the cable-access tv scale, the plot is less nuanced than an old "sgt. rock" comic, and only boris j. badanov-style "bad guy" mustaches are missing from the commies. this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad, too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposable thumbs.

this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. you think manos is the worst movie ever? it doesn't even come close to this garbage. i dont even know where to begin. the "russian" commander and the rebel chic are the worst "actors" ever to appear in a movie. they make the sister in troll 2 look like meryl streep. the goofy faces the chic makes while she's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. then there is the oompa music during the prison break, the totally out of place love scene, the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene, the fake castro, the fact that everybody has either a headband and/or a bandanna on some part of their body, the goofiest rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting ever put on film. this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans. definitely the worst movie ever made.

totally brain-dead actioner made in the philippines. this belongs to the mode of filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market. after a rather dull beginning, the movie takes off and never disappoints again. it is actually a rip-off of the worst movies chuck norris ever made : an american prisoner in vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope, then the president of the usa. one of his old buddies (played by b-movie stalwart max thayer) is sent to stop him. utterly ridiculous action scenes, putrid acting (nick nicholson's performance as the evil soviet commander is a must-see!)and implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public.

as a native of new orleans, i can state that almost everything in this movie, from the atrocious n'awlins dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of crescent city geography, is horrible. this is another one of those big hollywood movies that decides to stereotype new orleans as: 1. a city full of french-sounding idiots 2. a city full of people who sound as if they've just returned from blanche dubois' summer home 3. a city of drunkards, where every day is mardi gras 4. a city of deep mystery, where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo (i admit that maybe we are a city of drunkards; although every day is not mardi gras). "the big easy" is one of the worst films about new orleans. i wouldn't recommend it to anybody.

new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in thisdebacle of a film. quaid's attempt at speaking with a cajunaccent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in neworleans) is terrible. plot = elementary and mindless. thispicture refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves agradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film. there's none of that here. "bigeasy" tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes. don't be fooled - the real big easy is nothing like the townthat quaid & barkin bumble their way through.

young quaids fake accent was difficult to accept at times.the show was billed as mystery/suspence but should have been listed as a romance.don't rent this one if you are sleepy, it will knock you out.

licence fees to watch this trash, and pay for it with hard-earned cash? humourless, no hint of laughter, god knows how it won a bafta! we've now been subjected to "eastenders" for twenty years. when, oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is? crass pap! this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut, and never has done.the eastenders i know (the real ones) are kind, courageous, hardworking and loyal. and one of their greatest attributes is humour. it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler. and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including an omnibus)? nothing but a bunch of moaning, wailing, "dead from the neck up" wimps, who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other. what a great advert for britain that is!! do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out? obviously the woolly-minded section of the public does, but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything.

the other lowest-rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add. i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children, who insist on watching the sunday omnibus. my god, it's depressing! like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other, but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be. the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot-on. if anyone lived in a social environment like this, they'd slash their wrists within days. and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more 'ethnically enriched' than you'll ever see here. take my advice - avoid this nadir of the british tv industry. it is evil.

if this is classed as 'real life' of london, then the producers must be on different planet.it is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dingy, dross on tv.everyone is fighting, everything has nasty under tones running through it, nothing is done for genuine reasons.if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk, then this programme is by the farthest from reality.there is not one good word i can say about this programme. the only certainty is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner.even the characters are totally unbelievable!

this soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years, eastenders is the prime example. for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders "mirrors life"? life on which planet, exactly? it's written about "working-class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the "working-class" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders.this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford.thus, it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders.other soaps have followed in ee's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash. the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves. meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new, tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy.and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room. it's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison.

i think this programme is a load of rubbish. all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting?! these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives. also, the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes, i am bored with it. i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show 'tv burp' e.g. the weak joke "the princess and the pea isn't exactly shakespeare is it?" that had sonia and naomi in stitches. i don't see how that is funny. i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv licence so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. isn't there anything better than this?

i don't know how people can watch this - the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die, houses burn down, car crashes, babies die, and cast members being killed off every week. its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings. its so depressing. i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying - 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or 'whose house shall we torch in a months time?'its the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment, and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore

it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened. the 'square' is peopled by such a miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, spiteful, unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined. everyone is stabbing someone in the back, everyone is attempting to commit adultery, everyone is trying to cheat someone. that, or they are being stabbed, cuckolded or swindled. nobody is cheerful. nobody laughs. nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day. it's hell, with cockney accents.i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the samaritans. it's perfect viewing for the depressed. it doesn't cheer them up; what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad-arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse - they might be living in 'albert square'.apart from the above; as a representation of london's east end, it is pure hokum. the programme-makers have evidently never been across town. the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque. and this pretty-well defines the racial majority of the population. white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road flyover, and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that 'eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly'. ten healthy, smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation. eight of them are dark-skinned... what's more, i used to work with a bunch of anglo-saxon - dare i say 'pukka' - cockneys a few years ago. and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i've never had. each day was like an oswald moseley rally. they couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation. in fact their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixated upon sex-organs and their application. alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison.any programme that purported to represent london's native east-end caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast - even after the 9 o-clock watershed. imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark. but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful.i don't know how such a soap-opera came to be. this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever. and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition, it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic-depressives with cockney accents - what's the point of that?dull, dreary, unrelentingly disillusional, and ethnically preposterous. the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation.avoid it like the plague.

i've watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now. when i came across it on dvd, i didn't hesitate too long, even more, because i have a predilection for early belmondo flicks. but what a bad surprise! some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to shock audiences.widely hailed as one of chabrol's rare cynic works, the only lasting impression i got from re- watching it is... boredom. some movies really do not age in style. but what about movies which didn't have any sense of style at all?the flaws in the script, uninspired acting - presumably due to the lack of direction -, a sort of production design, which doesn't deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, last but not least, the worst editing job i've seen in ages, make this one truly hard to stand.my impression was, that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously, no idea or any skills at all. it really comes as a surprise, that this one didn't abruptly end chabrol's career. don't blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s, this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.

speed which i believe is direct copy of the hollywood movie cellular (i haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. i have watched this movie today on 12th january 2008 on rented vcd. it's release date is 19th oct 2007. but still fortunately for me i didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. so in this situation when i watch the movie, i feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance.off course as a bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. but now days it doesn't matter for me, if i haven't seen the original movie. i just found the main theme much similar to 'nick of time' and 'badshah'. in the movie sanjay suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef. this brings back the memory of 'true-lies'. the only new part was the use if the phone. but that too i found out now is taken from movie cellular. so when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear.the things i like about the movie is its pace. as the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. but this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional bollywood style of dhishum dhishum.the plot of the movie is also quite interesting. three stories going parallel, one after the other. one of the kidnapping of urmila, the other of the zayed trying to help urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister. these three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues.but then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. except sanjay suri, none other makes any impression. this goes even for urmila, who is always promising in rgvs movies. due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted. e.g. the scene at the end where urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. but instead we just wait for the end of that scene.other than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. showing so cool villains is good for hollywood movies not for bollywood the background of london is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. may be director has an impression that the climax in hindi movies must have such fights. they look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends.over and all, i find the movie once watchable. if it is coming on tv or you can get it on rent its ok. but then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. next time, when the movie is on tv, you can safely watch other channels.

welcome to the world of vikram bhatt, the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like kasoor, raaz and also the multistarrer awara paagal deewana and his one film with aamir ghulamone sneak peak about this films are that all are hollywood remakes and some decent ones like the once which workedspeed is a remake of cellular and that too a terrible one a look at the stars, we have the once saleable but now out of work urmila and sanjay suri, then we have the flop aftab, ashish chaudhary, zayed khan and othersthe film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there the storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like zayed hijacking a mobile company and many more and the stunts too are laughable while the twists in the end are too laughable the film also took a long time to reach the theatres which looses it's sparkdirection is awful music is outdatedzayed khan screams, makes faces.etc what he does always urmila is good in her part, sanjay suri is not that convincing ashish chaudhary tries hard in a negative role and he is okay aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role surprising the same director gave him his only solo hit kasoor sophie is horrible tanushree is a non actress

wait till you watch this one.... i mean even after reading this review. no other movie till date has sucked more than this one.... one thing i wont understand is that, when you are ripping off some english flick why to add your own creativity? with the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for "cellular" to be dubbed into hindi and released the movie. they might have gotten some profits that way i guess. if there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from tanushree datta and the girl who played the sidekick to aftab. i don't know if my problem is that i have seen cellular much earlier than this movie..... but that cant be a reason to support this movie... i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie.....please stay away from this flick.

this is a rip-off from cellular. bad casting... bad direction... bad music...and the list goes on...well there was no direction since story, scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie. even fight sequence is copied. one with the mace was from kill bill and another one with fire hose was from either a jet li's or jackie chan's movie (i am not able to recall the name of this movie)... stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing... cannot expected something original from any of the bhatts any more!!!

actually, i am not narrating the main plot in this comment but with just 2-3 sentences i can make it a spoiler. ok here are these- speed is just a 85% conversion of hollywood flick cellular into bollywood by using the software vikram bhatt. title has no match with the story, only it goes in the thriller direction. just that!! it doesn't deserve even a single star for its imitation, imperfect casting, poor standard and predictable story. undoubtedly now i can say that viram bhatt is slowly vanishing away from his director status as no any matured audience will appreciate his recent works including this. beside him, aftab shivdasani too making his outlook as cartoon-comic type. who knows how long will he last in the film industry more? sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a c-grade movie. but most supportive role was played by zayed khan which was somewhat identical with chris evan's role as ryan in cellular. with innocent face sanjay suri has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress. that's why those who have already watched cellular i advise you never to waste your time again with this imitation sack.

i happened to catch this on tv, and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based. i was very disappointed. first, if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it's not exactly an a-list production. gregory hines was a world class dancer, but sadly not a great actor.in fact, all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy, which can only be blamed on the director, who is this film's weakest link. charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stone's "jfk" in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the "real" child murderer(s), but without the benefit of a good script, an a-list cast or, it must be said, the talent. it just doesn't work.it's a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment.

what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of 'originality'. this film does not contain one innovating element. if, by 'originality' you refer to pathetic action scenes, overacting, gluttony in violence, blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. then, 'originality' is something swedish film can do without.how röse and karlsson can agree to 'act' in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me. and how eva röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-tv promoting it just disappoints me.this film doesn't contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just plain bad. these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy-fantasy containing violence, comic-strips and trivialized psychological portraits. i wouldn't be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a micro-wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors.i wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.

and it's only january, still i'm sure of it!by far this is among the worst swedish movies i've ever seen and to be honest swedish movies ain't that good in general. it have been claimed to be "original" and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a english speaking movie, for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can't help but to feel like måns mårlind and björn stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one swedish package. what can i say the outcome can just be...poor. first of all the story is just weak to begin with, even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories - first a failed try to make swedish action á la matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story. and if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the "cool stuff" that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that sweden also can do hollywood movies - which we can't nor should try to. for example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about "storm" while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness - really i don't think even stein or mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie, more than just trying to show off poor extra effects. for the actors, i've got to admit eric ericson does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through, even tough storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of dd he does not change one bit in his way of acting. jonas karlsson, well to be honest i thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by storm... really he just have to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. lastly eva röse is just beyond critic, both her character and her acting. the only reasons storm succeeds of not getting a 1/10 is for eric ericson and, what can i say, at least it tries..

and also a wonderful beginning, a real quick start. it keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come. unfortunately the high adrenaline dries off quickly, but most certainly after half the movie is over.and it's a shame, because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly. but that is also one of it's faults. by exploring too many things, it get's mixed up into to many things, so in the end you're too confused to follow any plot or characters. it's very dark and moody, but that doesn't help much, if it's also genre hopping just to try to fit any- and everything in it's story!

during production, this lwt series was titled 'rocket to the moon', a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough. then word came through that it had been retitled 'reach for the moon', as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series, and the same tired and boring love-triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes! any television program that decides to use the 'love-triangle' storyline for even a single episode is pushing it, but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable. there are reasons to watch however, with the scenery of the isle of wight certainly providing a beautiful setting, and the seemingly effortless performance of lynda bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks. this, however is not enough. a number of performances are noticeable , especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which jonathan kerrigan refers to as his face. i have already mentioned lynda bellingham in the role of 'fussy mother' (yes, thats as far as character development and back-story goes), but i was impressed by the actor maurice roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast, having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard attenborough's 'oh what a lovely war', and 'the eagle has landed', and tv including baywatch, holby city, the bill, eastenders, cheers, doctor who in the 80s, star trek, and even going to hollywood with sylvestor stallone in 1995s judge dredd) whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met - often incapable men, whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak. it is refreshing to see that roeves is still getting work, having also appeared in the 1998 british film 'the acid house' and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria bello and sean bean in 'the dark'. the standout reason to watch this series, even though his appearances are very few. another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program, is ben miles, in the role of the sex-mad 'typical man' brother (once again, what an original character!). as with roeves, the cv says it all. after elevating this, miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie 'v for vendetta', and the 2001 star studded film 'the affair of the necklace', alongside brian cox, adrien brody, christopher walken and jonathan pryce. unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is kerrigan and saira todd, both of whom seem to have been in casualty for too long, and haven't yet learned to act. even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory i have of her from the set, is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take, she subconsciously 'pulled her knickers out of her crack!'. familiar faces appear in each episode - child actors from cbbc programs, and dramas such as '2 point 4 children', and other regulars from commercials such as mr ben's ("they'll remember me for this"), lynda 'the oxo lady' bellingham, and others that i don't even want to remember. each episode halfheartedly tries to 'deal with issues' such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive pupils, and rocket building(!)... things that grange hill was doing better when my parents were young! overall, this series was a disappointment, and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series. unfortunately, for them they took the easy route, both in the writing and (for the most part) in the casting. i would recommend both 'waterloo road' and 'the street',to fans of good drama - the latter in particular which managed to achieve this. if you like the isle of wight, don't 'reach for the moon', reach for the holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development!

primary plot!primary direction!poor interpretation.

*****spoiler ahead*****i suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for tv movie, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but badly done, the acting wasn't especially good. and the ending of the film was just terrible. the main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film, and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath. it's completely pathetic.there is only one reason really to watch this film, yasmin bleeth, although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before ? don't bother even watching this waste of time, if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch "drop dead gorgeous" instead, it's only an infinite number of times better.

a `wacky chick' flick. a beauty contestant winds up dead and the usual suspects are rounded up. another entry in the vein of the texas cheerleader, this is an average example of its type.yasmine bleeth turns in her usual wholesome girl performance, and jill clayburgh does a good job as her stressed-out slightly obsessed mom.some mildly funny moments listening to the vapid self-serving pr coming out of contestants' mouths. (`i'd like to own a restaurant so i can give left-over food to the homeless.')you have to ask yourself what people are using for brains when they think a cheerleader spot or beauty crown is worth killing for!

this movie started out cringe-worthy--but it was meant to, with an overbearing mother, a witch of a rival, and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second. there was some goofy overacting, and a few implausible plot points (she comes in second in every single competition? all of them?) unfortunately, the movie suffers horribly from it's need to, well, be a tv movie. rather than end at the ending of the movie, an amusing twist in which the killer is (semi-plausibly) revealed, the movie continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure that justice is done. of course, now that the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift--her character gets completely rewritten, because the writers don't need to keep her identity secret any more. the cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a passably amusing movie.

no, it's just a cheap 1940s serial using the cap's good name. if you are a fan of the comic book, you will be greatly disappointed. they have radically changed the character. no shield, no bucky, no fighting the nazis, no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly: captain america is now a district attorney and no longer a gi.dick purcell as captain america? don't look too closely when he changes into his costume. it is pretty obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial(can you say flabby?). it is also very obvious that a stunt man is performing most of the action here. almost every chapter has an obligatory fist fight that is shot and performed in exactly the same way. the villain is rather bland and although he uses an alias (the scarab), he doesn't wear a disguise of any kind. the story is repetitive and very simple. the effects are laughable and the action is average. on the plus side we have sexy lorna gray as the d.a.'s assistant and the good captain gets to ride on a cool looking motorcycle in one early chapter. overall ok but nothing special.

the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one, and it is to the filmmaker's credit that he sets out to portray rural minnesotans with the same respect ordinarily reserved for coast-dwellers. it is weird, though, to find an independent movie, the brainchild of a single person, that is as unambitious and cliché-ridden as a committee-brewed hollywood potboiler.the portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate, i think, but these characters don't ring true to me--i have had quite a few meals in small-town diners, but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth-century english novelists. one might suggest that writer/director semans has no more experience with rural culture than the coen brothers, and considerably less satiric verve.

i'll say one thing for herman, usa: it will probably always play well to minnesota audiences. i can't imagine that there's another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of bemidji or a line like "i knew there was something wrong with iowa guys" would bring down the house. i actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so. basically, a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors (is suitors a gender-specific word?). it ain't progressive, to be sure, but it's sorta charming in its own right. pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband. overall it's just too cloying for its own good, but you've got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with kevin chamberlin's build a nude love scene. i will always applaud the depiction of people who don't meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual, caring human beings, but that's not enough to redeem herman, usa. to paraphrase jello biafra, it's nostalgia for an age that never existed.

my mother took me to this movie at the drive-in when i was around seven years old, which is thirty years ago. she had no idea a family movie would be so violent. my clearest memory was of the boy's father's face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. this image haunted me for weeks. i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime. how could i stop them? how could my father protect himself? you must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven-year old. it is as real as witnessing an actual event, and has no place in a child's innocent mind. it is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society. if only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that they protect them from images of nudity and sex.

the story has little to do with jack london's original novel. i thought the acting was very unnatural, the dubbing was done very sloppily and the story itself contains a fairly large number of inconsistencies and loose ends. apart from that, the pace of the movie was horrendously slow at some parts.

this movie features roaches as super flesh eating killers. this may have been the first movie where roaches were the primary killers, though not the first movie where roaches are killers. "damnation alley" featured a scene with killer cockroaches and "creepshow" had a story that had them. in this one they are the star. not as good as it could have been this one doesn't have all that many kills in them. i could be wrong on that point, however, because i have not seen this one in quite some time. the roaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them. yes, she is quite strange as at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer roaches and she is like "they are biting my hand", and she says this in almost a state of ecstasy. there is also one super big roach near the end of this one, like in so many insect films. not a great movie, but worth checking out on a night you are bored out of your mind.

"you got any beans? beans is good. you just eat them and you go." i couldn't help but laugh at that bit of dialog. beans are the musical fruit, you know. the more you eat them, the more you go toot, toot, toot.hmmmm... ok, i can understand why the actors were in this because they needed paychecks to pay their bills with, but i'm not really too sure what the intentions of the director and the writer were. even after watching the making-of documentary in the dvd extras.mike rooker gave this a performance it really didn't deserve. i've seen him in other movies much better than this one. what would have vastly improved this movie was to throw everything out, keep rooker and instead made another entry into "the substitute" franchise. rooker would have made for a terrific substitute teacher who instructs naughty and morally-impaired youth regarding the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society.casper, you really shouldn't be just pushing through the undergrowth like that as you could get poison oak. whoops. never mind. i guess poison oak is the least of your worries now. well, at least this time your croaking wasn't done by the tail of giant python. there are few things more embarrassing than being skewered through the chest by a giant snake. at least the death scene in this movie had a bit more dignity to it. as well as a more liberal smearing of karo syrup and red food dye. nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye!first time i've seen a monster wear a shiny rayon cape with a fur collar ruff. first time for everything, i guess. just to be nitpicky, though, if this was an indian ghost, how come it looked exactly like a monster out of european culture and folklore? wouldn't the monster have been more sort of more indianish?while i did watch this all the way to the end credits, i don't realistically believe that i could in good faith recommend it to others.

this may contain ***spoilers***where to start on this particular empty wasteland? well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot. acting talent, decent dialog, suspense, humor, hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick. unfortunately there was only a lot of gore, (even that wasn't done well), shooting automatic weapons and missing.there seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise, a native american cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, with his being tracked down by a federal special ops team who dressed in civvies(?). most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie, separating from the group so you can be picked off one by one. you'd think this team would know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappearing without a trace. when they finally realize they're being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot. tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money.when they're not shooting trees they're tracking this spirit who leaves no trail, (who knows how they're tracking it), and spouting a lot of macho bs. by the way, did i mention that most of this team are women? interesting listening to them talk tough. not very entertaining, but interesting.all in all, you can find better movies in the bargain bin at kmart.

was this supposed to be a comedy? the black cape and skeleton mask are hilarious. there is like zero plot. the movie starts out with an archaeologist and his assistant. they make a small mention of their dig site being cursed. and then, lo and behold......in drops halloween costume man, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask face, holding an axe. so, he kills off these two people. then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of predator, only the commandos are being hunted down by halloween costume man who is now riding a horse! more commandos show up, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a hiking group. yeah, production probably ran out of commando costumes. can you say, low budget? anyway, they come upon a lone old indian guy sitting in the woods. he's just too funny. and he starts babbling about something, but you really don't know what he's mumbling about, so they flashback to some indians getting killed. none of it really makes sense. and then we go back to our commandos where more of them get killed. and that's really basically the plot. it's so laughably bad, you just can't really look away because you want to see just how low it sinks. you could make the same movie with a camcorder, a halloween costume and a bunch of your friends with fake guns. don't see this thing if you want a horror movie. if you want a comedy, maybe? or just skip it and get something like the real predator.

a delta force army unit, assigned to find a batch of missing green beret bad-asses not known for going completely missing, will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an ancient indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave. the skeleton man rides a horse and has the ability to propel to and fro using a type of dimensional portal, and seems unaffected by bullet-fire and explosives. the skeleton man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride from behind and around his prey silently. the film's point-of-view through the skeleton man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color. in other words, he's not seemingly human, so how can captain leary(michael rooker, as grizzled and intense as ever)and his gang of would-be commandos stop this menace? for some reason, the skeleton man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant. what are the skeleton man's motives for slaughtering endless human beings? and, why is a blind indian living in the forest our commandos inhabit spared if the skeleton man, as a human, slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself? as completely stupid as it sounds. just unbelievable horrible. this is the kind of film that can deaden brain cells. casper van dien gets second billing in the credits just under rooker, yet is saddled with a ridiculously underwritten character who exits the film quite early. rooker deserves better than this. if i were an actor, i wouldn't want this movie in my resume. the skeleton man is a reject templer knight from a de ossorio film. he has a spear which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact. an arrow shot from the skeleton man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane. for nearly 99 % of the film, bullets are shot at the skeleton man and he can go in and out of that portal thingee yet, at the end, all of a sudden, he becomes vulnerable to attack. oh, and the horses also change as the skeleton man freely moves through the forest from that portal.the film is written and edited by clowns. the attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced pros, make really bad decisions throughout this film. the mind boggles with this film. good for some laughs, and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie.

i saw this on sci fi, and in retrospect, i'm not sure how i actually managed to watch it all the way through. this is utter trash. it's not a b movie, it's a "d movie" at best.basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse (and sometimes not on one) goes killing everything in it's path somewhere in the mid west of america. a load of people are missing (infact murdered) and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them. the best part of this movie, i'll tell it now, is there's some really cute girls. let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off, slashed apart, or hit so hard with a mêlée weapon that the head explodes off. that's no spoiler... the gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque. it serves no real purpose, either.here's what's good: the sets look ok, the actors sometimes act ok, the outfits and props, some of them, are decent.everything else that you can think of, sucks. a lot of the badness is in the editing. some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene. sometimes the characters do non-understandable things, and they're always splitting up, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that they're splitting up all the time and are ok with it even tho they're in a really dangerous situation and there's bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left. nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and i don't really get how this immortal, indestructible bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end, and frankly, i don't care. too much stupid, hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and i don't really care to list it all here. and they're all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when it's almost laughably bad... just awful.this movie is a complete waste of time. there's no excuse for watching this, unless the only channel you happen to receive is scifi and you're bound to a chair in front of the tv. but if you're not bound, you're better off doing a crossword, throwing a frisbee, or even just thinking. there's lots of much better b movies that you can watch.my senior year in high school my friend and i, in visual communication and deign class, made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie (there was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere. it was better work than this movie. that really says something about this and i'm puzzled and troubled as to why sci fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can show.the only movie that i've ever endured that was worse than this is raptor island (another brilliant scifi work)-though it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie- but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of worst movies i've ever seen.

a whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused, obviously. the original title of "cottonmouth joe" would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience. i have personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender) and it is indeed a lot like the movie skeleton man -- a dry, scummy film that provokes regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower.it is unfortunate that the choice of "skeleton man" for the title was finalized by the distributor (probably the work of some meddling hollywood no nothing studio exec who just didn't get it) and not "cottonmouth joe." those of us who have seen the film know that the skeleton man is actually cottonmouth joe (a skeletal-manish apparition, not a true skeleton man). the deception of the folks marketing this film is unforgivable, and for that alone, i cannot give this film a high rating. imagine this: when future filmmakers get together to create the true definitive skeleton man movie and need a title, they will be totally screwed and we are all, as serious fans of the genre, diminished for that.cottonmouth joe could've become a horror movie icon right up there alongside madman marz, black claw, mansquito, humongous, "nature boy" billy conners, morty the wooden doll, the boogen, eegah, the moon beast, bloody bill, the driller killer, mickey rooney, and so forth, but he will always be remembered as a sword wielding-caped-tackle dummy skull face-tied to the side of a horse-skeleton man wannabe.that's too bad.

jesus franco is pretty hit or miss on his films & i'd say this was a miss, that is, unless you're into total sleaze. i will say that the man has an eye for a good shot, even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean. this is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible, but the acting is the least of what this is about. and what is it about? well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some. most notable (?) is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently amorous german shepherd, and while what's going on is merely implied (thankfully) it is probably a scenario that i could have done without. i'd rank this up there with tender flesh as one of the franco films i'd rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.

i am a fan of jess franco's bizarre style, and a lover even of his trashier films, and my personal opinion is that he has, besides several very entertaining movies, also created a few masterpieces, such as the brilliant "paroxismus" aka "venus in furs" of 1969, for example. it is, however, an undeniable fact that the 180+ movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career, also include a bunch of big time stinkers. "sadomania" of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers, just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity.sure, the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time. the only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is, generously spoken, slightly amusing.after couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island, they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns, wardens of a local prison camp. while the husband is banished from the island, the wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac magda and an extremely perverted governor. the prisoners are, of course, entirely hot chicks, most of them blondes, the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles.the plot, if one can call it that, is extremely stupid of course, but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway. the (only) interesting thing about "sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a 'women in prison' film. there are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top, the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really nasty.it is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so boring. the sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes i actually had a hard time not to fall asleep. it also makes me wonder why, out of all pornstars, jess franco chose ajita wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who had been born a man (well, maybe for exactly that reason). if you really want to watch this, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only (and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor). don't expect to be highly entertained, however, it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring. i am a jess franco fan and i always will be, but "sadomania" is just bad. 2/10

ok, no one will confuse this with citizen kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless. there are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. on the other hand i hope they didn't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. here's a prime example. after one of the captive girls dies: "this is terrible. it reminds me of the day zenobia died" "a relative?" "no, my favorite cow." i guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. i will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. i guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. i hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient. don't worry folks, it's on it's way.

truly awful. obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars craze, but there's no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage. the storyline gets lost before the middle, the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non-talent that all he does is pose for the camera. an alien planet they land on is actually the naval stockyards in long beach, california. this movie actually made me physically ill watching it.roger corman has made some good, some bad movies in his career, but there's no excuse for this one. 0/10 - imdb won't let you score a zero.

i've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years (not consecutively, of course). i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11, and it was so atrocious i almost walked out; i think i didn't realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended. anyway, it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up. i can finally give it the rating it deserves.1/10 (that was strangely satisfying)

this movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the star wars movies. the film uses recycled footage from "battle beyond the sars" which is another roger corman sci-fi turd, but atleast this one is better than "battle beyond the stars" - there is no real acting in this film (but its a roger corman film-what did you expect)again the entire soundtrack was done on a keyboard/synthasizer, the sound effects are recycled from "battlestar galactica" - there are no special effects because they were recycled/rearranged space scenes from another movie, the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage. --ironicaly, the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance, and he'd resurface again to star in the sylvester stallone movie "over the top" - i give this movie 3 stars out of 10

a roger corman rip-off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget. all of the special effects were originally used in "battle beyond the stars", and i suspect a fair amount of the props, costumes and sets were re-used from other sources as well. the story seems to have been written around these elements, so this isn't really a movie as much as it's a recycling project. third-rate "star wars" junk wasn't needed then or now.

as several posters have "hinted," this is a sorry "star wars" ripoff. now if you're going to rip off "star wars," at least do it right; "battlestar galactica" did, and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it, but this is definitely not one of them. david mendenhall, the juvenile lead, actually isn't too bad, though he goes overboard on the "cute" factor every so often. vince edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his "ben casey" days; if anything, he's even more wooden than he was ten. the other performances are nothing to write home about, either. even worse are the special effects; the best you can say about them is that they're lousy. it's glaringly obvious that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them, and the "battle" scenes between edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot. a very weak effort from roger corman. skip it.

it took me a few years to hunt down this title, a major staple of my childhood. almost every trip to the video shop i'd pick out space raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me. it was, i suppose, my star wars.it's a shame then that it's such a stinker. my memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so i had to take it at face value. a crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home.aimed squarely at the under-tens it's got unwelcome slapstick, very shoddy costumes and make-up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and poor acting. but even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult, where i can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no-brainer fun/powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful.i imagine as a kid i probably found it quite empowering - there are lots of "i can't do this, i'm just a kid" "sure you can kiddo, you just have to try!"-type exchanges; the kid drinks beer, etc., but even by low budget 1983 sci-fi standards this one's pretty awful, with a real snoozer of a "finale".

this one hardly compares to the space adventures of its time. those being star wars and star trek. and while i am no fan of star trek, i recognize that this film pales in comparison to the series trekkies ooze over. in fact, i would place back to the future in better light in terms of space and travel.the story is of a boy who is captured by space raiders (pirates). in a obviously fake and unentertaining battle, the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them. and slowly, one by one, those raiders die off. in the end, the boy gets to return home and the last remaining pirates escapes gravely wounded.the acting wasn't that great. but what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue, effects, and storyline. how they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me.if you want to take a shot at it because it involves space, go ahead. but be warned. "d"

if there were an epa for film, then this movie would get their most sincere approval. if we all recycled our "stuff" to this degree, we'd never run out of anything.funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw starwars i: the phantom menace. at least lucas didn't recycle his old footage.this is a dud. but it's a nice dud. cute in spots (i liked when the kid said, "damn rocks"). and, if you like explosions (even recycled ones) you will get your fill.actually for an obviously "no budget" film, it makes out fairly well. acting is weak, but there is a little characterisation here and there. story is predictable, but will lead you along anyhow.this is an "everybody chases the kid" type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences. i gave this one a 2 out of 10.i dug up my old vhs copy of this film. i don't think it's on dvd.

cheaply pieced together of recycled film footage, music and ideas, this film cannot really be called "well". but for me, when i watched it as a teenager, it was quite amusing. (i didn't know battle beyond the stars before.) in retrospect it has got something nostalgic, regarding the sf wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time. its trashy old-fashioned look and its naivety provide a certain attraction. to enjoy this movie i recommend to concentrate on the paternal relationship between the characters of vince edwards and david mendenhall. in addition, i liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discovers its heroic qualities after been unwillingly confronted with the challenge to take care of a child.

the acting is excellent in this film, with some great actors. it was fun to see fred mcmurray as a young man. this is not a comedy. it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful. this is not a comedy. it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful, and some of them appear forced and contrived. it's in the script, though, not the fault of the acting.the 10 line requirement forces me to write some more...hmmm. loved carole lombard's my man godfrey, because it is a comedy and, while the acting is wonderful, the story line and the script itself, wins the day. carole lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress. i will try to watch fred mcmurray's features.

oddly enough, it's fred macmurray who plays the more "screwy" part in this screwball comedy. carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness.as usual, fred macmurray remains a mystery to me. the camera is no fan of his, he's not that attractive, and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grant-like role.ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombard's character. one can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle, reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurray's ineptness. but that's hollywood!the picture almost works but misses the mark, primarily due to macmurray's performance. it would've been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role. lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable; macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length.

happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash-in on the success of american graffitti.there were some similarities between american graffitti and happy days.both opened with "rock around the clock" by bill haley & the comets. both took place in a bygone era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles. but there were also some major differences. while american graffitti took place in 1962 california and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood, happy days took place in milwaulkee, wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school, dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence.happy days originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of bill haley & the comets' rock around the clock. but when oldies became hot, thanks to the success of american graffitti, , and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock, entered the billboard hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went through the roof. so a "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly substituted.the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right.fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist. liberties were taken and details overlooked, making this show less than completely authentic.this is perfectly fine. happy days is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics. one episode centered around the cunninghams building of a fall out shelter. another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life. the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black (in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life). the issue of the draft even came up on a later episode!the show as originally set in 1955. one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast. most of them were teenagers and as each year passed, it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast, moving the series out of the safe waters of the eisenhower years into the age of camelot, all the way with jfk and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s. that, along with the writers running out of ideas, and later, cast members like ron howard leaving the series, wisely quitting while they were ahead, left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead. that, along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn't control themselves every time the great fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very thin very fast.this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era. time heals wounds, you know. everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the "original hit versions" over those "new stereo recordings", those "new stereo recordings" worked very well on happy days. and this is where i find myself regretting my buying the dvd! unlike the complete first season dvd, the original music on the complete second season, has been replaced with different music. while it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch!

"happy days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970's to the early 1980's and seems to get more ridiculous with age. at the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families, and the scenes at mel's diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle). richie cunningham was the all-american blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president. potsie was richie's best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend, i guess. and ralph malph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz, if not the entire group. i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph malph. and there was mel, the middle-aged lug who ran mel's diner. and of course who could forget the appearance of mork? was this really the 1950's? ironically, films produced during the 1950's, such as "rebel without a cause" and "the wild one" have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays.unfortunately, the tv show "happy days" is not in the same league as "rebel without a cause" or "american graffitti" for that matter. "happy days" may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its burger diner, juke boxes, cool cars, and tacky plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal. "american graffitti" had something to say about young americans in the 1950's whereas "happy days" seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like. the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950's. "happy days" is, at best, a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop. as pointed out by another reviewer, the all-american kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like fonzie. and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his diner.a quick history: "happy days" was originally a pilot called "love in the happy days" that was rejected for broadcast. comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show "love american style" which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and/or alterations. in short, "love american style" was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut. "love in the happy days" did appear as a "love american style" show sometime in the early 1970's, but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about 1950's young people would be popular, particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people, such as the "mary tyler moore show" (and its subsequent spin-offs such "rhoda"), "the bob newhart show", and "all in the family". (how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!) subsequently, one of the young stars of "love in the happy days", a child actor from "the andy griffith show" named ron howard, got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called "american graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous "thx 1138" had bombed miserably at the box office. even when it was premiered to movie executives, again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't "fit" with what had been popular in the past, although they didn't realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950's. as everyone knows, the movie was a huge hit, and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. somewhere during the theatrical run of "american graffitti", tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like "american graffitti". they brought it back with the original cast, plus henry wrinkler as "the fonz", re-titled it "happy days" and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's."happy days" now seems ridiculous. the characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than what they superficially are. the issues they deal with are trivial. and their reactions appear mindless and even silly. nowadays, the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, the fonz. was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brando's character in "the wild one"? looking on the show with fresh eyes, i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks. this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time. "american graffitti" has many of the outward appearances of "happy days" but it had an edge. it had an honesty about the characters and their issues. "happy days" took the look of "american graffitti" but failed to take its heart.

each year the company called nu produces couple of "action packed", "full of suspense" movies. this little nugget, called shadowcaster iii(until i visited this site i wasn't avare this is a whole trilogy), is a great example of the good job the company is doing. frank zagarino is as mean as always and does a great job as almost undestructable(?), schizophrenic(??) android. i won't waste any more words since i don't want to reveal the terrific plot and ruin you a couple of great laughs.rating 2/10 (revard for those hard working tehnicians. man, putting together this kind of rubbish must be nervewracking.)

as other reviews have said, another of the countless number of alien clones, this time with a great wodge of the terminator thrown in, add a bit of the classic sf story "who goes there?", and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from the andromeda strain (apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer 'droids unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them).ok, the story: after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a caption. "25 years later". the crew of a relay station orbiting mars, due to be relieved in 48 hours, detect a ginormous space ship on a collision course. it's the siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. not a good time to have taken everything useful off-line on the relay station to do some repairs then. the approaching ship doesn't deviate from its course and is broadcasting a "do not under any circumstances enter this ship!" warning. after a lot of shouting at each other, the crew of the relay station patch something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time. but the ship changes course and rams them any way - impaling one of the crew on a stick-outy pointy crew impaler thing. the satellite starts to "loose integrity". bits de-pressurise. lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards. (why are they always sucked out backwards?). after a few keystrokes the wheelchair bound techy (who is called 'wheeler' - the only only detectable joke in the whole movie) deduces that the siberia is draining them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its engines. they all go on-board and take their helmets off. "do not enter this ship!" obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases. one team head for the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy clutching what looks like an american express card but turns out to be a minidisc. the other team find some switches. amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a rampaging alien. they switch the engines off but this means the ships reactor will explode. a spooky point of view shot starts killing people. there's some guff about the siberia having discovered an new ore, a petential power source worth millions, which mean the more venal members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it. the pov shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! walking noises on the soundtrack. unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted.after that it's all just running around and getting killed in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive - along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths. just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie. other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the on-board computer (not that the low levels of oxygen in any way dampen any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start). if the killer droid id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight curve and have another go at ramming the relay station why didn't it turn off the "do not under any circumstances enter this ship!" warning signal.. i'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away! was not a good way of going about it.musetta vander is the only person who gets to do any acting - everyone else just flares their nostrils all the time while baring their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other. it that sort of script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off, or get wet while not wearing a lot. unfortunately it didn't. one of the things wrong with this movie (apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever) is that there was no gratuitous nudity.

this is so poor it's watchable.the plot deals with a grizzled spaceship crew happening upon a drifting, apparently abandoned russian craft.in the empty vastness of space, the two craft accidentally collide (!) - and 'alien'-esque fun ensues as a cyborg from the russian ship menaces our crew.the spacecraft interiors are clearly a dolled-up factory set (metal walkways, boilers, piping). in this entirely unconvincing setting, 'kody', 'snake' and the rest of our hero crew grimace, grunt, run about and continually and repeatedly rack their shotguns without firing them.the continuity gaffes are what define this movie, and they are nothing short of amazing:stuff appears and disappears. the shotguns are racked. a cigar gets longer by being smoked. the shotguns are racked again, just to make sure. content of a bottle increases by being drunk from.the film progresses through the usual clichés by way of intense ham acting, poxy camera work and ed wood quality props to a showdown climax.

well now this strange movie. it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at. actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film. oh here i go. alex ferns is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change, but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama. i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray. i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives. best avoided.

i debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it's my least favorite herschell gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome twosome, but it has the best acting i've seen in a lewis film. however, we all know that's not saying much. once the movie was done, i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a 4 hour movie, though it was only 82 minutes long. i'm trying to see all of hgl's films and that's probably the only reason to see this one.the gore is good as usual, the one thing that herschell seemed to get right. the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception. that exception is frank kress. now, would i say that he's a good actor? no way, but he's good compared to everyone else. the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end, i didn't care what happened just so long as it ended. i know this is a cult classic but i didn't enjoy it very much at all. i hope you will.

i love camp movies, believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of gordon lewis don't bother me at all, but this is just one of his most stupid movies, even more than blood feast, i'm not kidding. the gore gore girls is about a mad person who kills a lot of go(re) - go(re) girls of a night club. a detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret. maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting h.g lewis films, but that is not saying much. the camera work is even dreadful.but at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting ... you going to pass a good time with it, and the killings are just absurd in a very, very bad way: a girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt (!) and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples. you going to laugh like anyone with this. but the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it's campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very american way. though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an x rating because of it's violence.only if you want lo laugh and pass a good time (but only with a lot, a lot of beers).

aside from frank kress (who played abraham gentry), an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie, there really wasn't anything particularly good about this film. why it is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me--the film is 99.44% crap...and exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis. in the 1960s and 70s, lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films, such as blood feast and monster a go-go. however, in recent years he's been christened "the father of gore" and he has many, many fans--fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were. but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts, at heart, his films are pure crap--and don't believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films. this would be like putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre!!the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers. when i say gruesome, it's very bloody and sick for 1972--though by today's standards the special effects look amazingly lame. so, while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film (i'd rather not explain them--they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women), at least they won't nauseate you because they were done so poorly. it's obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins. but to have them doing some of the sick acts, even if unrealistic, is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny.the only hope in the film, as the police are all idiots, is a guy named abraham gentry--whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor, david lochary, from the early john waters films. while his acting is bad, he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest. he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made!! it was also odd that so many women wanted him--especially because they just didn't seem like his type.as for the rest of the folks in the film, they are cretins and idiots who could not act. in fact, i was kind of hoping more would be killed--they really had it coming! none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never re-shot a single scene--as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed wood's masterpiece, plan 9 from outer space. in fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes. now i know this will sound pretty mean, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who strip to get their next fix. when these ladies take off their clothes, men in the crowd give them money to put it back on (wow--henny youngman should have said that in the film)! but, considering lewis' budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get.overall, a sleazy bucket of bile that manages to be worse than most of the director's other films...and that's saying a lot! it's violent (yet dumb), anti-women (treating them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish.

the hebrew hammer is a clever idea wasted, as the execution is weak. as if often the case with iconoclastic humor, it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs, which simply isn't enough. poor-taste humor has two elements -- poor taste and humor -- and both are needed here, but the humor is pretty scarce. as a result, it is often painful to watch, all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers, particularly adam goldberg as the hh himself. the shaft references are funny, though, but only to those who know those movies, and they certainly don't carry the hebrew hammer.another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of american jewish culture, and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes.

i was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best, the only funny character is, believe it or not andy dick. the timing was just horrible on most of the jokes & gags and the writing was bad, i mean i know its supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just did work. besides this whole genre has been beaten to death already, with all the austin powers movies & undercover brother, it just seems old, it also just feels like a rip off from undercover brother (which also wasn't hysterical, but a lot funnier than this). also, for an comedy/action movie the direction was kind of bland. i don't know if this is going to be released in theaters, but it definatley is made for tv.

ouch. this is one ugly movie. not only is it badly acted, but it absolutely destroyed the book as well. horrible. how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me, but they sure did. don't even think about even renting this.

this movie is one of the poorest adaptations of a fabulous book that i've seen. jean george's novel is a fantastic book that i think is an outstanding read for any child. i can't give the same endorsement to this movie.

i hardly know where to begin.huge continuity issues, bad acting, etc. for example, sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head.but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family, is not even touched upon. instead, in the movie, he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and, when he gets tired of it, he goes home. where is his development? where is the arc?if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey 60isms (double/triple/quadruple visions of the falcon) and terrible production quality (crackling, ahem, fire, winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then restarting, etc.) i guess it *might* be ok for an 8 year old. but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment. read the book instead.

the movie isn't too bad, up until...the main problem is with the ending, so it's a pretty major spoiler...for the time it was made, it's a beautiful movie, and does get a lot of it right.however...in the book, sam succeeds and lives his dream, whereas in the movie, he gives up and goes back to the city, completely destroying the "you can do what you put your mind to" theme of the book.this movie is a desecration, and instead of remaking classics that don't need redone, the hollywood types who haven't any better ideas should do this one, right this time.

role-reversal remake of 1942's "the major and the minor" has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just ginger. lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. sidney sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for dean martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). diana lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays lewis' love-interest here. she's cute; jerry isn't. *1/2 from ****

with al jolson at the height of his popularity and warner brothers's the jazz singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own jolson-esquire characters. but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first part-talkie, the matinée idol lacks the singing voice of its star (the now obscure johnnie walker), and has to make do with just his visual antics.the matinée idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank capra. capra's first couple of full-length features for harry langdon reveal a very showy, excessive style, which made langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable. a couple of pictures later and capra has learnt to ease off a bit, with some fairly regular and decent camera-work. however he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy. the longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags, but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles, and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances. theoretically, a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny.of course, capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director, and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect. he cuts down the line, closing in on walker and bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up, neatly establishing the wordless connection between them. then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in capra's early 30s output.johnnie walker, columbia's answer to al jolson, is not an exceptional talent. his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out. bessie love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too, with a very expressive face. kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. there's also a good role for lionel belmore, that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s.the matinée idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces. in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of capra's work before he met robert riskin, a disappointment.

royal rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn good. the rumble itself is pretty uneventful, filled with mid carders, and a winner that really had no point in winning, and why on earth did the young stallions vs the islanders main event? half the crowd left. jessie ventura sounds bored, through half the thing, and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of hogan vs andre more interesting. mcmahon and ventura don't have the chemistry of gorilla and jessie.ricky steamboat vs ravishing rick rude. heavily disappointing match, with too many rest holds, and too much of a sluggish pace, sink this one. when it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. steamboat wins by dq.2 1/2 /5next is up dino bravo attempting to set a new bench press record, with ventura spotting him. horrendous segment, with no entertainment value what so ever. ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even mcmahon admitted it was boring. controversy or not, i wasted enough time on this crap.0/5wwf woman's tag team championship.2 out of 3 falls.the glamour girls|c|/w jimmy hart. vs the jumping bomb angels. this is the best match of the night, no i'm not kidding!. very exciting stuff for woman's wrestling, and you'll be hard pressed to find stuff this good, now a days. the jumping bomb angels were way over, and the crowd went ape sh*t for their title win.3/5contract signing between hulk hogan and andre the giant. hogan gets a decent pop, but there a few noticeable boo's for him, probably because its in canada. a bit too drawn out for my liking, but it was necessary for the storyline. it got it's point across, and had some effective moments, but a lot of the times, i kept saying "get on with it". both sign, and andre slams hogan's head on the table, and pushes the table on him.2 1/2 /5royal rumble match. very weak royal rumble, probably due to awkward pacing, and the true lack of star power. i think vince was testing the waters with this one, and it showed. ventura seems uninterested, and i don't blame him. crowd clearly wanted roberts to win, yelling ddt almost every 5 minutes he was in there, and while duggan got a good pop, i don't believe he was the winner they wanted, and where did this take his career? nowhere. bret's 1st ever royal rumble, and he made an impressive showing. it wasn't terrible, but it was quite lackluster, and it didn't have enough to make the show, considering this was what the show was based on.2 1/2 /5hogan has an interview with craig degeorge. standard hulkster interview, but not with the same craziness, and outrageous remarks he usually pulls.2/5ted and andre get interviewed. andre claims he will deliver the championship to mr. dibiase. short, but effective.3/52 out of 3 falls.the islanders vs the young stallions. crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them bolted for the exit's. it's quite dull, and had no business being in the main event. jessie and vince seem bored, and argue about other things while the match is taking place. islanders win, due to taking advantage of roma's injury.2/5bottom line. historically important i suppose, but there is really nothing to see here. this was just a starting cue for great things to come for the royal rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing on here, going out of your way to see. i usually recommend everything once for die hard wrestling fans, and considering it's the 1st royal rumble event, i suppose i have too, but prepare to be bored a lot of the time.3/10

i bought this 'film' from a gas station in the 3.99 bin for one reason: billy drago, who is one of my favorite actors. he is terrifically creepy and good, but that's where it stops. the movie itself is a dirt cheap, gratingly awful attempt at a horror western, and manages neither, never mind a successful merging of the two genres. the acting besides drago's is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears, the production values are nonexistent and the script , i don't even know where to start.avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like me.terrible, shameful unforgivable.

an interesting premise, and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: i'd love to see drago, stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable. still, it was the sets that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. i don't know where this was filmed, but were i to hazard a guess, it would be either an open-air museum, or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the "real old west". okay, so it was shot on a college kid's budget. that said, i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults. but taken all together, and being generous, i could not see giving it more than three stars.

alleged "scream queen" debbie rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex-confederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacre.action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development.billy drago is good in the thankless (not to mention pointless) role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor, including the town and the fort, both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at party city.do yourself a big favor and watch ravenous instead.

this movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest repute) who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop. upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there (even though its only 15 miles away), so they walk. when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby. they soon find that something isn't right here and fort mcmillan (ft. doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie. first off the acting is very flat, only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in. my first though was poor acting, but at the end i watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it. on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances. take for example no one would take them to ft mcmillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away. yet when we arrive at the fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom must get supplies from some one, not to mention mail etc. it is supposed to take place in 1867, yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights (they aren't on at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time. there are also places where you can see paved blacktop, (and maybe a car at one point, didn't want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. if they had followed the rules of the "world" they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it, and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better.

the real plot...a group of post-civil war prostitutes seek alternative housing in fort boom. lacy everett and a close-knit family of call girls have been eating date expired sausages for days and plan to move into the former fort mcmillian. locals warn the women of eating more of the dated sausage. because there is a vicious pyromaniac loose in the area and he refuse to shuttle them out to the property. when they finally arrive at their destination, they discover their stomach is full of gass after all the bad sausage. it is not long before they learn why their new home is called fort boom.

charlie (george "norm" wendt) and rhonda ("just say" julie brown) are a pair of cheerful, murderous aliens who become stranded on earth and stumble upon a tiny western town. they become deputy sheriffs and dish out a deadly form of justice to speeders, murderers and others, while getting on the bad side of some of locals (led by wayne grace). meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (anastasia sakelaris) arrives in a skimpy/shiny outfit with her black human husband (christopher m. brown) to find them and tv reporters and government agents turn up to fill up time.from what i can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western...) in one movie, and what a stupid, unfunny mess it is, despite energetic acting from the two stars. the script is downright atrocious.

one of the worst films of it's genre.the only bright spots were lee merriwether showing some of the sparkle she would later bring to the time tunnel and batman.a young patty duke also outshone the more established actors.

robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for tv's late-late show. wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though patty duke (playing a cute brat pre-"miracle worker") gets a colorful, memorable exit. ** from ****

this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!. all the characters are decent i guess, but the story is so so, however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored. jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was very boring a lot of times, however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining, and had some good stunts!. i have not yet seen the hong kong version, however i'm sure it's better then this dud, plus the twist is very predictable!. it's really lifeless and bland, and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this, and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable. the opening is supposed to be memorable, but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that, and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it!, plus i really didn't root for any of the characters. this is a very mediocre jackie chan film, and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!, not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans. the direction is terrible!. james glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with extremely bland camera work, bad angles, and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout. the acting is so so. jackie chan is amazing as always, however he is not his usual energetic self, and looks bored and ps*ed off throughout the film, had zero chemistry with danny aiello, and i really don't blame him either! (jackie rules!!!!!). danny aiello is ok here, as jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he had zero chemistry with jackie, he did ok i guess. roy chiao is decent as the main villain, but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing, he still is damn cool though. rest of the cast are average at best. overall not worth your time or money. *1/2 out of 5

the protector. you hear the name. you think, "ah, it's a crappy hong kong movie." guess what - it's not hong kong. and yes, it is crappy. this amazingly stupid jackie chan film, ruined by us, yes us, the americans (i'm boiling with anger, ooh, i think i'll jump out that window!), has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. sounds cool...but it's not. don't waste your money renting it. to prove he could make a better cop film, chan made the amazing police story (1985).

this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses. his low-budget hong kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris. there is nothing about chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star. in his hong kong films chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but "the protector" is lifeless throughout. danny aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. both have been better in worse movies. the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings. the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab. it wouldn't be until the made-in-canada "rumble in the bronx" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie.

most critics have written devastating about that michalkov-movie, but i wanted it to see myself. and, unfortunately, they are right. the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice, sweet nothing. you would not believe, that this director earlier has made masterpieces like urga and burnt by the sun. the characters in the storyline are not convincing, neither jane nor mccracken nor andrej. only general radlov worth being mentioned. it remains on the surface all the time. politically it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty. and, having lived at least half a year in siberia: my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in michalkovs movie. regarding "burnt by the sun" by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie, one of the best i ever seen in my entire life, i was totally disappointed by that one. sorry. nevertheless, michalkovs unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there.

i saw this ego-centric "effort" at achieving a film of "epic" status in the company of several native russian family members. five people gave 5 different reactions, from mikhalkov worship to my cynicism.i saw a movie that looked like mikhalkov took a lot of "canal +" money, put some of it in his (and other's) pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students. i counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. there is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes. contrast these for yourself:·cadets polishing shoes with a dog.·train station scene (saying goodbye to andrei).·outdoor panorama shots.·ormond talking through the keyhole.·initial attempt on the grand duke and later chase scenes to get andrei back to sing in figaro.·fencing sequencejulia ormond is faster than superman. learning about his transfer belatedly, she gets all the way across moscow in one minute to say goodbye to andrei.the russian natives felt that the impression given of russian life was "caricature" and not history. they called it "tourist postcard" russia.they were all proud that a russian director/producer/fixer has managed to break into the "big time" and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming.if you want to "think" you have seen russia go see this movie. drink some coffee before you go.

this movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in russia. "epic movie about russian culture", "great saga of russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. for me this movie was the biggest disappointment. the main character played by oleg menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. what is there to admire? in the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all. people's festival scenes look like boasting about russian audacity.i respect mr. mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director, but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "tzar" of russian cinema.

set in a post apocalyptic future, the new highlander is an effeminate little twerp named quentin macleod, who is being mentored by a new ramirez while his little sister tags along on their quest to thwart an evil immortal overlord. to do so, quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord, korton, does.in short, this is pure crap, much like the highlander sequels. quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a "woe is me for i am a reluctant hero" kind of way, and he never catches on to the fact that he's an immortal and can't be killed, at least not easily. ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart korton himself.

if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be misled by what it says in the booklet. this is a complete waste of time and energy. i have watched bunuel, i have seen dali, and admired them; but this isn't surrealism, this is not supposed to be at all. didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture? after we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remainings of our civilization. what if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital? with all due respect to the effort put in this, maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film - or whatever it is.

avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. it gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. what remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but i surely didn't noticed! the nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and i am still not sure it was worth it...

let me say at the outset that i'm not a very artistic person and that i don't "get" new art. that being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion not crazy in a good way. filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, i feel the energy and passion of this painting." the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts, though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film. two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to do what these characters were doing, i have no idea. i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.

the abc gears up it's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia. yes folks, it's all there baca bourke (jeremy sims,an actor of little talent) fire hero , lill (libby tanner plays bronwyn craig in the bush), fifi (nadia townsend) town slut, preggers by baca's brother joe (i think). then there's uncle geoff the, big daddy of lost springs. uncle geoff's scenes are like tennessee williams on speed. only saving grace is russian actress natalia novikova as baca's loony missus. she is great. i can't understand why john waters took the gig as lilly's psychologist husband. must have needed the money i expect! still, he won't last long as lill and baca will be having it off toute suit. just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be. frankly, i'm ashamed.

i decided to hire out this movie along with a few other old horror movies.this was the worst,some of the killings were good and theres a bit of humour but i couldnt stand this,everytime a killing happened they would show scenes of all these old movies that the killer used to be in,i give this 2/10.

okay, so this was made way back in 1993. directed loosely by robert iscove and written loosely by john miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story. hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. for certainly it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get.tim matheson, looking somewhat older than i remember him, played the empty headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat dull and empty life. well, it came to him in the likes of tracy pollan, a somewhat vacant looking girl with kinky sex as her means of conquering her guys.come on, phone sex, even in the 90s was old hat. can't believe someone would fall for that old line. but mr. matheson seemed to buy it. and it cost him plenty. the hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment, putting all her junk in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. that's when i had enough of this trite movie. it made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so i could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a hike.i give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. that's how bad i thought it was. i guess you can't blame the actors. but they were awful. did they actually try to play this with a straight face?

although a well produced made for television movie, dying to love you reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor.the film opens up to roger paulson (tim matheson, looking much older than i remember him to be), who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty, lonely life after his wife ruthie (who looks suspiciously like roseanne arnold) leaves him with the quickness. now all roger has is his cats....and his ad in the newspaper. once his ad is answered, he calls johnnie-elaine-lisa-oh it doesn't matter i'm whoever you want me to be-lawrence. then...they have phone sex.i'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but i remember that phone-sex bit was played out by the late '80's. i'm sorry but that was trashy.soon roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance. they fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then have some kinky sex with roger's son in the other room. she ties him to the bed and seduces him.roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that johnnie-eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around. god forbid women only sleep with one man. soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, johnny girl wants roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. it's funny to see roger believe her through all this stuff. that's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife. he takes her crappy advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with fake id cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. he immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested. even though all this jazz, he still loves the dumb broad. she tells so much lies, it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once.roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named angela who looks like something off of gremlins 2. she has a child as well and roger takes quite a liking to her. but something inside roger's subconscious keeps him connected to lisa rohn (if that's even her real name) and he keeps going back to see her.now lisa is the "ex that won't go away" as she "earns" herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at roger's doorstep and his son matt is so busy trying to check her out, he pours juice all over the floor. il' rog is so stupid, he throws lisa out and doesn't even change the locks. boy, if all people were that stupid, i wouldn't even be writing this review. the ending of this movie is so corny, you won't believe.tim matheson is a made-for-tv-movie king. he just looks like such a dawm mummy in this movie. he's a little wooden and stiff. the dazzling tracy pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true. she is extremely beautiful and i do see what michael j. fox sees in her. this movie is great to watch when you're on that late night tip, but then again, you might fall asleep, considering how dull and bland it is.

this (allegedly) based-on-a-true story tv movie concerns a woman on the run from the fbi and a *seriously* stupid guy.first, we have roger paulson (tim matheson), a "regular guy" type with a mind-numbing job, an ex-wife, a kid he hardly ever gets to see and some cats.next, there is "elaine-lisa-you name it" (tracy pollan), a smart, sexy, good looking woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she ever told the truth.roger and lisa meet when she answers a lonely-hearts ad. roger is one of these poor saps who can't seem to handle living alone, so after his wife dumped him, he places his ad.it doesn't take long for roger to figure out that lisa is *not* a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her. he doesn't even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws her out.go ahead and watch this if you don't have anything else to do.

if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future, go on and watch the movie (6/10). it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi, nice acting, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story.if you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). the story is totally different from the original book. this may explain that the movie is voted 1/10 from people around 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing.most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much to the worse): - the magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (changing weather, creating illusions, transform into animals, ...) in the movie the magic is more like "jedi-school for the middle ages" (tm) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). that the devil is looking like emperor palpatine (after part iii) doesn't make it really better.- the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie. in the book the story is set near dresden, which krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities. (this part might have been changed to cut costs.) i also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains.- the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style. lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. the book never suggested such an environment.- in the book the master tries to make krabat his successor but krabat rejects. krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. in the movie krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy.- the movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x. ok, the stories are missing anyway in the movie.also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes: - in the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work. this explanation is missing in the movie. sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy.- the book explains why only a few "gesellen" try to confront the master: if the master dies by any mundane reasons, the "gesellen" are free and keep their magical powers. if the master dies at the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.

this film is about the encounters of 7 couples on hampstead heath in one sunny wednesday afternoon.it shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking up a relationship, homosexual, elderly, blind date and escort service. they are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location, so that is a disappointment. the film is a collage of conversations, without any discernible plot. the film jumps from a pair to another without any logic. i find this film boring and purposeless. the only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film. it is sad that talents like ewan mcgregor and sophie okonedo get wasted by this film.

the acting is good.thats the positives out of the way! sosn is shallow and superficial.almost all the characters are middle class and english.the gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.this film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.there is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don,t care about them,catherine tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her nana sketches failed to convince,however if she had said "what a f****** liberty" i would have agreed i'd rather take a walk in the park;unintelligent rubbish!

this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies, particularly "love actually" (which i loved) - a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples. it's a great idea poorly executed. the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't resonate. most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors.the version i saw (on a plane) was called "scenes from a park", which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a 'sexual nature'.i was so looking forward to this movie, but ultimately it is disappointing. don't bother.

there is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie. it's just terribly dull. dull is the photography--- the film stock appears old and faded and washed-out. maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, dunno. dull is the script, which is tedious and 'jules pfeiffer'-ish. that is, kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool. like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight. the 'slice-of-life' characters were mostly annoying. true, they were real to life, but hey, if i wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things, i'd just watch myself. i wouldn't trapse all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid, and an evening, watching someone else do it.i expected a funny, bright rom-com. what i got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year-olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera.i gave this a 4 out 10, because it appears that someone tried, at least.

this movie is by far the worst movie ever, the story line is weak and never shows what happens to the people after the 20 was left they hands. this really bugs me. it drags on and on with out any meaning, very boring. the only good thing was the cast, wow, lots of big time actors and actress in it. but besides that it was horrible, terrible and repulsive, do yourself a favor, do not watch it.i gave it a 1 out of 10

this script was mildly original when it was written in 1935, but the poor performances and the inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend. some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. a few of the plot twists were creative, but i was very surprised to see it so highly rated here at the imdb. a few scenes are worthwhile, it's as a film that if fails completely to entertain. if you like this sort of montage, run don't walk and get "tales of manhattan" (1942) a marvelous film that follows the life and times of a topcoat.

i did not like this movie. i rented it hoping it would be something like the 10th kingdom. i was disappointed when i discovered it wasn't. i also found it just plain nervracking. the acting was bad, the characters where unbelievable and the time jumps were crazy. i only recomend this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around, but i'm sure there are better films with the same thing. i can't believe i wasted my time on this one.

loving the andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, i eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-tv film. unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. first of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing andersen's fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. secondly, pretty-boy actor (really... ever seen a picture of the real andersen?) kieran brew manages to portray hans christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was. though annoying and irritating like andersen, brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever. thirdly. the love story between andersen and the fictional jetta (whom actually should be henriette, the wife of edvard collin)... why? this man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!i could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.

i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions, and i even liked the wade/quinn tension in early episodes. some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories. however, as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond. there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. and every world had one of the characters falling in love. the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top. too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends (a la star wars) traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years, rather than a tired band of knit pickers.

ok, first off there may be a spoiler here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information. my subject line says it all but surely people will want to know why it's so stupid.first off, this film follows a bunch of yuppies as they go to a sports game in chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto. scary, huh? well, first of all, emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown rv/winnebago, tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it. so these guys are going to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the bulls or the white sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put espn to shame. yet they're smart enough to earn livings that would pay for the stuff, but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love.i gave up on the movie within a half hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. they wind up in the ghetto, yet their main danger to their existence is denis leary. a white guy. i'm no racist, but come on. in anything resembling reality - and this film was trying to be an urban nightmare - denis leary would not be trying to kill emilio estevez, he'd be hitching a ride to get the f*** out of dodge himself!!!this is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, although i'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema. if mst3k were still on, they surely would have devoted an episode to this one.

let's get one thing straight; this was bad! so putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories.the ever repeating storyline (who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances.) a typical storyline goes as follows; sue (the mother) opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful (as if that doesn't get old! har-de-bloody-har!), some australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" -look it up- appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything/everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a small mercy)the rest of the plot revolves around the father (gary) getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out.the phrase "words fail me" is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say. it is so incredibly bad! so horrible, that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on.it saddens me though, to see someone as good as sally bretton (good actress, i like her) make a prat out of herself, ardal o hanlon (my hero aside) has the ability to be pretty funny - but not here - and ben elton, distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this...thing then comedy is in very serious trouble!

....and now i'm up to episode #7. i really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled, once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series really is dire. to have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! it's so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad, maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. in some episodes i haven't even laughed once!oh, and i can't believe ardal o'hanlon actually stopped doing 'my hero' & started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'blessed' were. don't get me wrong, 'my hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk.and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well, when there are so many great tv series' that aren't getting released!

i have seen this movie but not in a single sitting. what happens it that it is playing on the tv, i watch for a few minutes, find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room. during those few minutes i do not laugh once, experience no pleasure in what i am viewing, and find myself more depressed that angry. interestingly, i am told the psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. this movie tests that theory.i think part of the problem is that i spent nearly ten years in chicago so as i am watching the scenes i am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus i am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. it is entirely possible, i am willing to concede, that if you are not a chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. if so, i envy you.and yet. john hughes set his films in chicago and those movies worked for me. i think the difference is that hughes was a first rate writer. i think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations, as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. in a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. and it is not easy to achieve. if it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. in "adventures in babysitting," it doesn't. i hated those characters. there is a difference, profound and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic.for me every scene in this movie is a clunker. there is no humor, no humanity, no people one can recognize. just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out, certain that finally hilarity will ensue, this time for sure! it's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. it's embarrassing and after a while, usually at the point when i get up and leave, i start to feel pity for all concerned, which is a kind of emotional connection, i suppose. elizabeth shue is terrible. she doesn't act, certainly not act comically, and it's entirely possible she can't. but lord how she tries. she looks older than 17, and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. and she is not alone. it is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. now, this was an early effort for chris columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. john hughes himself) certainly helped, so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. but the film just reeks of desperation. yet like i said it may work for some. if any of the above appeals to you, and it clearly did some of the reviewers, then go get the dvd and knock yourself out. otherwise, avoid this mess like you would a dark chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.

this movie was a complete disaster for me. there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable, and that is *some* psychological credibility of characters... unfortunately, here, this is not the case. the main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have some reason for such behavior, it is not revealed to us by the director. sophie marceau's character is particularly irritating, making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie, when one could expect something more rational (for example meeting with her mother in the hospital)... and why exactly did she marry this guy? (no, this is not a spoiler) the plot at times seems like ripped off some soap-opera, and while the actors' performance is not bad, this does not help much. all in all, i just could not find a way to connect with this movie. not that i tried too much after the first hour, though. i have never walked out of cinema during a movie, but this time was the closest in my life so far.

this is a movie that should have been a mini-series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space. the whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub-plots, character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere. there is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl, she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real. they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband. with that said there are no less than 1000 sub-plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. in the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring. you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer. after a half-hour, and completely disinterested, i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off. the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.

having broken into a secret database file for matching dna serums,federal agent frank poo (andy garcia)discovers the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath,played by michael keaton . however,when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong,a certain mr.poo has to do everything in his power to ensure the madman stays alive in order to make the inevitable transfer possible. by the way,his name is'nt really poo,i just feel like calling it him. despite the original concept at hand,this is an implausible and turgidly unexciting action thriller.i've never been a big fan of andy garcia,and granted his charecter here is'nt that attachable,this movie winds up all the worse.the action sequences are handled pretty disappointingly,and the ending sucks pretty bad. having done a great villain in pacific heights,keaton's psychopathic bad guy here is a let down,providing a madman too funny and charismatic to be deplored.brian cox is also wasted as garcia's firm and frank superior.

this is one of those movies where i was rooting for whoever could end the movie the quickest. i wanted to see the cops kill keaton and garcia just to get it over with. basically, this is the deal--two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer keaton. is it worth it? no!

this movie is absurd. absolutely terrible. michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie. the plot is totally not believable! michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but then escapes. he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital. he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital, blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge (why?). and to top that andy garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow. the plot is such baloney! maybe the worse movie i have ever see.

i can't believe i watched this whole movie. another "ishtar" in that i kept waiting for it to get better, which never happened. the sound is terrible, going from too low to hear the conversations, to blaring sound in seconds. the plot is absolutely implausible, the acting is mediocre, although keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although being typecast in that role could certainly be considered a negative. the director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medications, science or anything of a technical nature. "sociopath"???? i wonder how they came up with that diagnosis? there are so many errors, goofs and things wrong with this movie that if one were to list them all it would possibly set some kind of record. demerol as a general anestetic? a motorcyclist on the freeway wearing a non dot/snell off-road helmet. san francisco??? paper walls move when tapped, helmets just appear out of thin air, guns point one direction but hit things in another, lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a scene in the move that doesn't contain some kind of error. my wife, who is an rn in an oncology unit finally left the room before the end of the movie so upset over all the medical errors. i gave it a 2 only because of keaton's acting, else it certainly would have gotten a 1.

i really wanted to see this film - i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. a cop (andy garcia) has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. the only match is a convicted serial killer, who escapes from jail. to save his son he has to track down the killer.michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film. keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring. it's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring.garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par. barbet schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like "barfly" that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market) directs well enough - i honestly thought the script was the culprit here...it's just a big mess.the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. what should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just a hollywood action dud.

well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. to summarize things up, cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(michael keaton).well criminal agrees but escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son).well, the police in this movie doesn't have a brain, in case they never heard of a tazer to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie, as simple as that.but it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly.

they give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase. the main characters are involved in one constant stand-off where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. and i'd like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the a. garcia bit. it's like some local cop walking charlie manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee. get real!

i haven't seen ishtar, but i did have the misfortune of seeing kevin costner's postman, this is worse. maybe the absolute worse piece of garbage i have ever seen, and if you look at my review for moulin rouge? that is saying something. bad plot, acting was substandard and even wasted (even though, yes, michael keaton has been in some of the worst movies i have ever seen), and this movie has no redeeming value to anybody with more than half a brain. do not see if you have graduated the 4th grade as you will find this an insult to your intelligence.

this plot had more holes in it than an oj simpson alibi! i noticed two star trek references in the movie and, yet,ironically we have a lead character played by andy garciawho is the antithesis of the vulcan philosophy of, "theneeds of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one." let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of san francisco at incredible risk. michael keaton's character is almost asunrealistic as well. he neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when garcia foils hisattempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. the child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after beenheld hostage several times in a short expanse of time butput her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it. andy garcia's child is something of an anathema in thismovie. he is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the movie's bright spots. he furthermore utters a line, that must have been the result of serendipity, regarding fighting cancer that parallels keaton's motivation to escape. all in all, the movie was not acomplete waste (see from dusk to dawn 2: texas blood moneyfor that) but disappointing considering the talent on hand.

this movie, "desperate measures", was.... i'm not quite sure how to even put it into words. was this supposed to be a comedy? i couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was. i love michael keaton, and i cannot actually comprehend that he did this. they did a good job at keeping my attention because i couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to get minute by minute. i actually just registered on this site so that i could get this out. i don't review movies. i don't have time for this, but i cannot let this go knowing i haven't done my civil duty by letting people (those who have an iq of 85 and above) know that this is no action/thriller, it is honest to goodness funny. you people that actually got thrills off of this scare me. go watch a good movie like million dollar baby. clint eastwood's acting is not superb, but i was balling at the end. exercise your brain america!

exceptionally bad! i don't expect much from garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today but keaton really should have known this movie would suck and gotten out while he could (not that i'm especially fond of him but hey, he did batman).in one scene keaton is transported to a hospital chained down and wearing a hannibal lecter kind of face mask when two attack dogs bark at him (dogs can sense evil you know (puke)) and keaton growls back at them making them back off and whine with their tails between their legs. did the movie turn comedy right there? garcia makes a fool out of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogue only a complete retard could find plausible and the kid is too annoying to feel sorry for..if you are gonna make a movie with as poor a plot as this you need some charm, humour, some solid action. take die hard for example which is great despite its rather crappy plot.even though keatons character was a joke i routed for him all the way. i wanted to see garcia cry over his dead kid and keaton sipping martinis on some paradise island, however! this movie makes for a good laugh.. watch it with a witty friend and you can have some fun as this movie begs for wisecracks in almost every scene. all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. greed made this movie and thank god it bit its own ass.

words can scarcely describe this movie. loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a silly plot, and poor music, this movie lacks in just about every category.don't be fooled by the imdb credits. this is not a michael dorn movie. he's a secondary character in the grand scheme.also listed in the credit's is an actor named "prince" - which makes me wonder if it's the same artist formerly known as.... then again, i'm not sure this movie is worth watching just for that.big summary... bunch of teams... one has kidneys... one has $35,000.... one has an "illegal substance".... and one has $350,000. add some confusion and mixups as to who needs to meet who, revenge on being taken, and such, and you end up with this mess of a movie.given a choice, i'd pass on this movie.

i watched "gristle" primarily for the presence of michael dorn, as i enjoyed his worf portrayal on star trek tng, but had never seen him out of his makeup. dorn appears to have a nice presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. this movie, however, gave him little dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can, indeed, use the "f" word.it appears that this movie was made by someone who fancied himself as a forward-thinking type, with a social conscience. yeah--- for 1965. today, the themes are so belabored and sophomoric and cornball that even spike lee's dreadful "bamboozled" looks good in comparison.this crime-caper flick has an intricate labrynth of double-, triple-, and quadruple-crosses, but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it collapses upon itself within the first 30 minutes. mostly, after that point, i simply watched out of momentum, and a mild curiosity about how each scene would play out. there is a great cast here-- you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from much better movies. why are they all in this? i suspect it was 1) the work, and some money, even if modest. 2) perhaps the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around la--- you know, perhaps they participated to support him, as a fellow struggling movie guy on the third and fourth tiers of the hollywood scene. dunno... but the movie was half-baked--- not really "finished." i gave it a 3, although my affection for the actors involved was undiminished from my admiration of their previous work. let's hope everybody has moved on to more professional, more carefully done, and more thorough projects since.

i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible. i've been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing. this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground. i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant. if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try (le dernier combat). there have been very few movies that i couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them. absolute dribble!

while traveling by train, a woman (stéphane excoffier) mistakenly gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. sooner she finds that a weird lonely pointsman (jim van der woude) that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track. the man lodges her in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them."de wisselwachter" is an overrated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere. i like movies off-hollywood, but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end. the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive. i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark; i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality. in the end, i was absolutely disappointed with this feature. my vote is three.title (brazil): "o homem da linha" ("the man of the line")

i think this movie was made backwards, first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action, and explosions, and then the story-writers got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together. this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script. the movie makes no sense. seriously, even if you are a segal fan there's no reason you should ever want to see this movie, except if you're one of those folks that like to stare at accidents, because this is a horrible accident, and should never have been released upon this world.boran.

lord have mercy! why was this film made? why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it? the foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind.the film has an ultra-cheap look to it. like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach. what's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate. the result is a film that just don't look right. the fight scenes are so dull and edited 'discretely' to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore. none of them are engaging or exciting. the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it. the eastern-europe locations (a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down, or non-existent) look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an 'action' film (what action?).and what is the deal with the title? as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign. which one does the title refer to?the dvd is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and in dolby 5.1 sound. neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent. the foreigner is not worth one second of your time. gotta love that tagline tho! 'if they think they can stop him, they're dead wrong.' sheesh!

this movie simply does not work. the action scenes were shot to look stylish but just come out looking sloppy. seagal barely fights and a lot of his scenes are shot from the back ( if you look in some of the scenes it is not even him, but a 100 lb lighter stunt double) the movie is just all around bad!

three words: what a pile..... two words: don't bother! one word: sucked! there are zero reasons to see this movie. even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie. the martial arts, the typical aikido, are horrible. the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic. the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his "kill move" to his victims. worse yet, is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. how stupid. seagal's acting was plain stupid, but i still give this movie a "6" for acting because of the supporting cast whose "villain" roles were actually quite entertaining.the plot is just dumb. seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill. his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time - at no extra charge - and nothing stands in his way. not assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death.i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story. there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it. no one should bother with this tripe.

there are films that are not released in theaters but on video. this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does. no story, inept violence, over acted, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film. and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel's other movies.

seagal needs to get back to basics breaking bones and kicking butt. no more of this slow motion crap like foreigner and in the shadows fighting like half past dead. exit wounds showed more of his fighting skills with some wires which was ok but then he went back to b movie directors.

i am a fan of his ... this movie sucked really bad. even worse than ticker! & that movie was bad. it was kind of like they popped it out in a week. looked to be very low budget. only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations maybe, & poor hummh! everything! it just blew.

i usually really enjoy steven seagal movies. they are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an adept of aikido, i usually like the way steven incorporates these martial art techniques in the fight sequences.however this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone direct someone like steven seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence.i never saw the end of this movie. i walked out before the end simply because i couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie. i am sure that many people also share my feelings.

bad acting? yes, but it was not a surprise. stupid story? yes, so what?but why, tell me, mr director, why all that slow motion crap? fight scenes were bad, really bad, because of slow motion and bad cutting. not because of seagal."what if i just speed this up for 2 seconds and then slow down those next 5 seconds and then... maybe i need to flip the coin to decide?" what were you thinking, mr director???

one of the worst movies i have ever seen. seagal has been acting in several entertaining action movies, but this time this movie really sucks. just stupid killing and really stupid storyline. in addition, seagul looks fat and old.

first: i like s segal! but in this movie, he has hit rock bottom and started to dig!the plot what plot? very strange and unbeliveable plot.the actions way below segals standards!the good parts mr segal is a pro. and shows it. that's it.summary i could write (and have done so) a better script for mr segal. in case you read this stephen, mail me, i'll give you a better script to do a better movie! the only realistic part is the one where... (see spoiler part).spoiler part (stop reading here if you plan to see the movie!) - - - gas leak? wow. disecting a 'black-box'-recorder in a hotel room? i work in the industry, laughable! the bad guy 'get's away', that much is true in life!

imagine this...whenever two people meet in this movie, one of them is shot. the plot just does not exist - it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it. if you decide to watch it, you will regret it.

steven seagal's films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since the patriot. the plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. the film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. oh, and i haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by seagal standards. even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for seagal fans. give it a wide berth!

i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill.watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people. i havebeen always looking forward to seagal-movies and, unfortunately, i was first disappointed by glimmer man, which i found really bad. the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has everacted in. horribly boring, badly edited, wrongest soundtrack and so on! dear reader, do yourself a favor an stay away from this!honestly: stay away!

i like steven seagal but i have not a clue what this movie was about. i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on who's side.hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better. my wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans, however. :p

can they possibly get any worse than this? probably. but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does. well kind of; this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys he just wounds them. by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america. but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and foul up the mission. the fights just don't have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all. anna-louis plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden. also in the cast are: jeffery pierce, max ryan and harry van gorkum. don't put all the blame on seagal for this clunker.

they actually make a big deal out of a scene in which steven hurdles a 3 foot fence. the plot is...barely there, the acting (so to speak) is distressing and the action is catastrophically lame. this is the worst seagal film ever, and that is saying something.

since i'm from norway (one of the top ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times. and since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns, it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in norway during the five minutes of the shooting there. mr. direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice, so he must have powerful friends in the customs.please do at least _some_ research before going to an "exotic" country, dudes -- you may hurt the feelings of old fans.sverre -- old fan with hurt feelings.

if i could have given this film 0/10 i would, and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low. its worse than awful. if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it (at least minimum wage). some of the camera shots were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. i only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of 'action' scene). in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). the chief villain keeps coming back to life. he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. to sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. it looks very low budget (even for seagal). the colour is dull and grey. i could go on and on....just like this film, but i wont. watch this film if you've got insomnia. its guaranteed to put you to sleep.

i saw that "the foreigner" was ranked in the "bottom 100" movie listings here on imdb, so i wasn't expecting much when i tuned into it on the usa channel a week back, but i did have hopes. "belly of the beast" (which aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout, so i thought that this movie might have some of the same. alas, this movie fails the standards of basic watch-ability in almost every way. the screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a john lecarre novel and a richard ludlum movie, but done by people with none of those worthy writers' talent for plot and characterization. instead what we got is a glum, mean-spirited, nihilistic, cryptic mare's nest of muddled motives, tangled alliances and back-shootings. and chest shootings. and bombings. and eviscerations. this carries over to the directorial style, which relies on hackneyed 'grainy shot/slow motion' shots every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. these filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when mtv directors used them for whitesnake videos, and the director works them like a punch press, hoping to inject some weird art-house techno thriller coolness into the proceedings. segal himself is just awful in this. he spends the entire film talking in a hoarse, throaty half-whisper and alternating between two expressions: looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose, or looking constipated. and he's so chunky (and vain about it) that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera. i understand that it's hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages (although denzel washington and paul newman never seemed to have that problem). but you deal with it by being honest about it, and by growing as an actor, not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes. so i can't really tell what's going on, and the movie doesn't give me a reason to care about what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing. not a recipe for a good movie experience. oddly, most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking; in fact, if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasn't a close-up of seagal, you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lighting,colors, and composition and by how beautiful the eastern european settings are. but dressing up a rotten egg as a faberge egg can't make it edible. and the proceedings are rotten at heart. there are 'cool' movies (like "versus"), and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (like "underworld") and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers (like "the bourne identity" and its remake with matt damon). and then there is this thing, which can't make up its mind what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things, and fails because it has no guts or soul. this is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget, so you can't really put it in the same class as "manos", "killer shrews" or "hobgoblins". but i'd rather watch all three of those movies back-to-back several times than watch "the foreigner" again even once.

what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film? arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. what possessed anyone to make this film, which explains her unique artistic vision, as being the result of an (imaginary) affair with a grotesque, yet charismatic hairy freak (played by downey)?in real life, arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman's role to express herself. in this movie, arbus is an ultra-dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a "beauty and the beast" devotion to an interesting man.for this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. independent of that, it is also just dopey and dull.

hadn't really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it. i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly.when the movie opens up, you see nicole kidman going to a nudist camp. whoa. shock. that scene, the dialouge, were all great. and then the movie went downhill.while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie sucked. it was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. robert downey jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit through. it tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors.don't waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.

for anyone who cares to know something about the real diane arbus, or who values psychological veracity, this film is abysmal. arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless, and troubled person, but this film depicts her as completely self-involved, and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. kidman portrays her as wan and vague, whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma. the totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable, and robert downey is truly annoying in his smirking portrayal of someone who seems to think he's superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. the film depicts this encounter as being the source of arbus's interest in "freaks," which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. the mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way.

in order to enjoy 'fur - an imaginary portrait of diane arbus,' stephen shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer, diane arbus. paradoxically, it's the very use of diane arbus' name and knowledge to her life and work, that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale.what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful waspish and glamorous nicole kidman as the anti-glamorous jewish diane arbus, is that shainberg didn't get arbus or what her work was about (unsentimental realism) and seems only attracted to arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks.what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty & the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as kidman's hairy fictional love interest. however, it's not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film, but the director's misogynistic stance that diane arbus, one of the art world's most singular and original woman photographers, was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work. while his previous film 'secretary' was a study of female masochism, his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely - and flys in the face of the real life diane arbus' courage, tenacity and fearlessness in single-handedly exploring the often shady world of outsiders.imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star madonna's life with guy richie as her svengali, the man behind her career, and you'll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is: it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject, or just choose to ignore all the facts.it's a shame because once you remove all reference to diane arbus, this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to secretary. 4/10

in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously, and move into 'adult' films, mr. hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. true, it's got every cliche in the book in it, silly fantasy stuff and all that, but more importantly- it's got elizabeth mcgovern.clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film, she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material. kevin bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but mcgovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty. the 'teen film' fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he'd find some new material. but i keep going back to mcgoverns performance, because it's truly moving. mr. hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them (some kind of wonderful, breakfast club) and when his material bumps up against a true talent, some wonderful things can happen. if only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff.

warning, spoilers ahead (even if i doubt that anybody hasn't seen this yet)the movie starts off rather well, but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny, sugary sweet, predictable and unrealistic 'harmony romance' mess. i mean, it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage, but these problems are never solved but just forgotten.basically, as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back (without even asking) all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation. given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and cliche' 'having a baby will change everything' ending.the two main characters' families and neighbours are also extremely one-dimensional, and don't seem to serve really any purpose if not to irritate the viewer, and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the 'harmony moments' start.i am sorry to be ripping this movie, but given the start i would have expected something more. 4/10 for me.

dustin hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's reputed to be; a spanish/italian co-production filmed in italy with the director using the pseudonym "dan ash"(!), the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a $1,000,000 hidden by gangster cesar romero (who, despite being third-billed - after elsa martinelli and hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!).hoffman's performance, obviously, is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz - an accident-prone american treasury agent of sicilian descent (named puzzu, which nobody seems to be able to get right!) sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain "inconspicuous" but, instead, is forever getting into trouble - though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot, foiling the crooks and winning the girl (martinelli as romero's daughter, who's somewhat wasted here)!! still, the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster riccardo garrone: apart from his would-be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect, he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes! also, in view of the story being set in rome, it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a spaniard (doubtless an exigency of the co-production deal)! along the years, i've missed out on hoffman's other italian comedy - alfredo, alfredo (1972) - a number of times (i guess, mainly, because leonard maltin only rates it *1/2 in his "movies & video guide"...but, then, madigan's million gets a bomb!); with pietro germi directing and co-starring the luscious stefania sandrelli, the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable, and i really hope it turns up again on italian tv soon...

we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. well, we got it home and could not believe what we saw. its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. the main character is all over the place... one moment, he is like an immature little kid, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker.the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy, but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. nipple slips, close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. we were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. if you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch's... this is for you. if you are looking for something beyond that, this movie was empty. the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.

i'll give it this: i didn't stop watching, and it's not corporate, which is kind of cool. but my internal critic cut it to pieces -- i suppose i see too many movies. wooden script, the slang just sort of clanks out of their mouths without any kind of flow. editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel, but mostly its irritating -- jerky, quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups. the actors were marginal, though letisha had her moments.i'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis, he's a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing. the directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him, even; i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already. i didn't care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around. the completely predictable ending isn't credible at all. i'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he deposes are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams. "oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation? here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, go run it around the corner for me. now don't steal from me, etc."a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but it was let down in the end. handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-raising, if only mildly interesting. there are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film-school offering. 4/10, an f.

ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on? that is how i ran across this tripe. for myself, i would have been better served tossing and turning for the 97 minutes i wasted with this film.in its attempt to "be real" this movie's characters come off as such gangsta stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a wayans brothers movie. the dialog? please! it sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film.the editing was horrible. one of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chase down a bunch of narrow alleys. cut to the characters being chased, though, and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background.when any of our "homies" get shot in this film, he bleeds miraculously through clothes that have no holes, which is more than i can say for the plot of this predictable load of....baking soda.indie films can be great even if they are low on budget and effects, but they still need to have some cinematic integrity. if i could have given it a 0, i would. if you watch it, i hope it is on cable, because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay...

after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version. i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach. i was disappointed. i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played. maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bach's music that can explain the film. i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it, but i did not. see it at your own risk.

very stark, very drab, no real drama. why not just make a documentary? this isn't exactly the passion of joan of arc. the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances. i love bach's music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film. the great gustav leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) bach. we don't get much of a sense of him as an actor, since he's given so little to do dramatically. mostly, he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms. bach's life, of course, was not an errol flynn movie. it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard. this probably means that the life isn't a terrific candidate for a film. the music, of course, is another story. i recommend the stations of bach. far more information, for one thing, and some insight into the music, which is, after all, why bach interests us in the first place.

almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines (very briefly) and getting naked (not very briefly) in front of a anonymous (and uncredited) panel - almost certainly including producer charles band. thrown in are random scenes of surrender cinema's many movies (primarily lesbian scenes). most of the women like "riding horses" (hmmm); there is a polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition; a 'secret; camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen...jacqueline lovell (too made up but still beautiful) introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a 'sexy' way to the camera (if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with lovell and vanesa taylor from femalian is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian 'couple' ever). weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women, a frankly dull and uninspiring experience.

this one is a real stinker.the story just isn't up to par with most other tz episodes. it's pretty boring, though seeing peter falk made up as a fidel castro lookalike is kind of amusing.whenever twilight zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown, i'd grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it wound up being this episode! strange thing? this often happened to my mom (another tz fan like me) as well. there were so many times that one of us would say to the other, "i was all set to watch _the twilight zone_ and guess which episode was on? the cuban dictator episode!" obviously some people like this episode, as it gets a 6.7 rating ... how that happened, i have no idea - but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot!

while the twilight zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven--with some great episodes, some lousy ones and many in between. don't believe the die-hard fans--there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them.in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro, a near lookalike (peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard) obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them. while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this), it's amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay!! think about it--serling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious, preachy and silly in the process.it's indeed bad--almost laughably bad when seen today.

patsy kensit and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of art-gallery related murders, but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous. the serial killer suddenly isn't important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife (who's basically just a co-worker of hers) is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect. "tunnel vision" is a really dull, implausible and tension-free aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sex-thrillers like "fatal attraction", "disclosure" and "basic instinct". the characters are extremely one-dimensional and pretty much every good-cop/bad-cop cliché is extendedly described in the script. the struggling position of police women in a corps full of men, the shoot-first-ask-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc etc even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag. yawn! kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable, but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine. the end-twist is more or less interesting (not at all original, mind you) but, by then, you stopped caring for the characters a long time already. the scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ludicrously fake and clive fleury's directing is completely uninspired. what a total waste of time

anupam kher is an excellent actor, he debuted at 28 playing a 50 yr old in saraanshnow he turns director with ojjthe film has a good plot but it's regressivethe theme has been done to death and urmila's character looks too put on while anil-mahima and abhi- tara tracks are too sudden and then forgottenthe film moves a snail pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between anil-fardeen and abhishek where fardeen says to sell the houseabhishek getting caught for a crime and anil shouting at himthe climax is too much thoughdirectorally anupam shows potential, but has some way to go music is okayanil kapoor excels in his part like always fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs to improve abhishek is excellent, this was a turning pt, people realized he can act urmila is okay mahima and tara are wasted waheeda is good

i saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and because david zucker was the director. i saw his previous "naked gun" (both parts), airplane and top secret!, and i liked, at least i had a good time and laughed. i'm not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces, but were ok. i don't recall any other more stupid movie than this. it's incredible how hollywood industry is in total decadence. if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture, then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days. this is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people. i don't have any good to say about this film. if you are planning to rent it or buy it, please don't waste your money or your time, avoid it no matter what. even if you are fan of one of the actors, does not worth it. in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid. i won't see a zucker movie again. (he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie, imagine that!). pathetic. awful.

this film is about the worst i have seen in a very long time. terence stamp's talent is totally wasted and just about the only thing that i enjoyed was hearing a favorite song of mine, "if i had a million dollars" by bnl, in the opening credits.ashton kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy who gets roped into house sitting for his boss. misadventures ensue. blah blah blah. if you have time to kill and having nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. otherwise, watch something else.there are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it is nice to see molly shannon and jeffrey tambor on the screen. they are always pleasures to watch though this film managed to dampen even these bright spots.

yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood can't even do the basics when it comes to film-making that it used to do in its sleep for decades. if the writer/director had any brains they would have based the film around stamp's character of tyrant boss jack taylor. when he's in the film early on it's nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing. once he departs for the majority of the film and kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventures house-sitting with guest after boring guest dropping in, the film totally disintegrates.as a result, what should have been a passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker.

this film made me so angry because of its stupidity that i felt the need to create an account on imdb to share with you my opinion. i liked ashton kutcher in "a lot like love" and this is why i still wanted to see this film despite it's current 4.2 rating. it is highly over-rated. i trusted that an actor (any of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such low/now quality production. it is very disappointing. the theme of home-sitting was much better used in "deuce bigalow: male gigolo". things that did not make sense here: fist of all, the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who doesn't know anything about taking care of it. secondly, the rule is not to let anybody in the house, but the house-sitter fails to follow this simple rule. the door is not locked?! and so on..

dreamy young ashton kutcher (as tom stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde tara reid (as lisa taylor). ms. reid thinks mr. kutcher is gay. kutcher works for reid's father, an anal retentive terence stamp (as jack taylor). kutcher agrees to "housesit" for the boss, believing it will get him closer to reid. mr. stamp has a pet owl named "o.j.", who becomes a toilet cokehead. this is a film to get your restricted to "g-rated" pre-teens ready for raunchier "r-rated" fare. it will help if they haven't seen the plot before, and especially like moronic potty humor. remember, people get paid to act like this.** my boss's daughter (2003) david zucker ~ ashton kutcher, tara reid, terence stamp

i was intrigued by the nasty boss character as i am one myself, and the actual boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger ashton kushner, but this movie is so puerile i had to turn it off. it was a waste of time to watch it. when people started peeing all over the living room, it was too much to watch. painful, awful crap movie. if they had just toned it down a little. are there really people out there that find it funny and like it? i was relieved to know that imdb readers rated it so low. the career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor. i liked that part. also, the opening scene with the coworkers on the train was cool as i like his coworker's characters. if you can stomach non-sense movies or you are pretty young, then it might be one you can stomach.

it was dumb. sort of like an adam sandler movie. there were a few funny parts but not that funny.i liked some of the actors in it though. there were some sat. night live people in the movie. but i wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on. and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie.

to be fair, i couldn't bear to watch this movie all the way thru, so i have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film. but the first 30 minutes or so are amongst the worst i have seen in a while. children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written, acted, and directed slapstick humor, but adults in full control of all their faculties should steer clear of this stinker.

"there are some things you just don't do" so says the tag-line of this, a 2003 david zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled my boss's daughter, and it's the tag-line which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it. there are indeed some things you just don't do, with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within my boss's daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture. my boss's daugther is a sordid; creepy; grotesque experience, a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. to see it is to endure it, to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself  if any of the cast; writers; extras; hell, even the guys that worked as runners on the set, aid in producing anything as earth-shatteringly poor as this again, then it'll be either because they've been sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of film or, it'll be because they've most probably garnered employment on behalf of the friedberg/seltzer mob.my boss's daugther, (which i'm pretty sure ought to be titled "my boss' daugther", grammatically speaking), revolves around its hapless male lead, named tom stansfield (kutcher), and a night in at his boss' house as he chases that seemingly elusive 'goal' that is his young, blonde daughter lisa taylor (reid) - someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of jack taylor (stamp). tom spies lisa early on, she's taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. after trying to talk to her, but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in tom's crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after-dark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her - and yes, she does still live with her father. think hitchcock's 1960 film psycho with the gender roles between norman bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughs.the distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. they are a ruthless and smarmy bunch, whom it's made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush, without ever returning them. one day it happens with tom there, and his wish is to return it, thus pounding into us that he's-not-like-other-guys(!) this, as he first sees lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position. this rather obvious and flat-footed attempt to try and get us to 'side' with tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co-workers in this company.it is, however, as close as my boss's daughter comes to any level of film-making. from a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from hell. tom's arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is charged with house sitting jack's pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house. it's been established terrance stamp's character means business in the strictest of manners, firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee. it's not that jack is a shrewed businessman, he's a cleanliness freak; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land. you can imagine, that when we're let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong, there's obviously going to be trouble.the film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. the first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top, you may smirk, but by the time half the house is wrecked and michael madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug, you've got your head in your hands. each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless, the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall. inbetween the gross-out wackiness, the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky, saccharine driven romance as lisa and tom bond whilst talking of in-workplace and out-of workplace persona's, and that maybe they have more in common than first thought. by the hour mark, the film's opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when there's an entire scene that exists purely to target paraplegics and a dumb subplot to do with a head-injury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded. throughout, stamp's character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them, to which the common-place reply ought to be whilst channeling jack taylor: was reading the screenplay first too complicated-a concept for you, stamp?

this movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen. the humor was crude, hardly funny and been heard a million times before. the start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on. i got about halfway through and couldn't stand to watch any more of it. luckily i was only watching it on tv so it didn't cost anything, but i seriously recommend you do not waste you time or your money.nothing in the movie was new. the characters were not at all developed. i actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events occurring ... thats like what happens in home alone or something. not to imply home alone was in any way as terrible as this.

this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched. i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10. my advice is don't watch it. this doesn't even classify as a movie.you'd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie. acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline. highly unlikely sequence of events which aren't even funny. they are actually very lame and stupid. very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie. might even upset their careers a little.when i walked into blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie , so i decided rent it. i sincerely regret it.once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen. i was hoping it would get better , but instead it got worse.i am not exaggerating this. the movie is terrible. don't watch it. hope this helps.

this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there is so much at the house that goes wrong that would not happen it isn't even funny. granted this is a movie meaning things that won't happen in normal life happen here, however this movie is more far fetched than theories that no child left behind is working. all of these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage. i could deal with an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour i just can't take it, i would rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. did i laugh during this movie? no. not even once? no. horrible, horrible, horrible. the fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with ashton kutcher bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse. but wait, the day is saved because the damn owl can fly. wow amazing! however, i do give this movie some cred, its not as bad as epic movie.....

this is the first time i'm entering a comment for a movie i haven't viewed till the credits. reason for this is simple...people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. i usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but i reckoned this to be watchable. a regrettable decision which was based on other ashton kutcher comedies that were (semi-) enjoyable such as a lot like love and guess who.where those two movies had their charms and laughs, this had none (and i mean none!!). the acting is horrible, especially the 'boss'. tara reid was no surprise, how dare she call herself an actress?! the premise is thin and the plot doesn't thicken at all. not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and/or sweet...but as you probably already guessed, this was not the cast at all! the script felt like it wasn't quite finished and i wouldn't even be baffled if the director did some rewrites while shooting. my dog could've written a more coherent script, seriously. and he's not exactly lassie either :-).stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goof-ball comedies at times (like i do). this low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many...i (almost) never give a one so therefore...a 2.

for years i hesitated watching this movie. now, i know why. it was even worse than i'd expected. ashton kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career, since 'dude, where's my car?' tara reid co-stars as the girl of ashton's dreams, who asks him to babysit her father (and his boss)'s pet owl for the weekend. the rules: 1. no shoes in the house. 2. no people in the house. 3. the boss' son stays out of the house. 4. don't touch the furniture.well, you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes, how the rest of the film is going to turn out.you know, there are films like, "meet the parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it's entertaining to watch, and it's delivered in a way, that you can't wait to see what happens next. this, is not one of those films. you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen, and they're mostly stupid things that would never actually happen. it's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off, because it was so bad. but, i paid the rental fee, and figured i had to watch it now.tara reid was good, and i would like to see her in more films. though, i'm not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her career.the end result is a happy ending...but of course with the kind of film it is, you would expect nothing short of that.don't watch it. you'll sincerely regret it!

ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? well, look no further! this movie has it all! racism jokes, handicapped jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating dirt jokes, old man young wife jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, crap jokes, falling flat on one's face over and over jokes, overuse of blood jokes, rape jokes, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, a bunch of people yacking their coffee back up jokes, nudity jokes, see who can say the most swear words in one scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people!the worst part is: none of it is funny! (not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with.) it seems that when it just can't get any worst, it pushes your expectations to an all new bottom, as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. there was one scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time. i don't think i need to point out which one, but then again, i'm sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling.there was one moment at the end of the movie that actually made sense and was slightly realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled on with the nastiest remains of a trash bag and thrown several feet on the ground only to have a bunch of beer bottles smashed into his head. all of this probably when he least deserved it. so all thought of a 1 more point redemption was quickly regarded. this is indeed a terrible movie. this is one that needs to be studied and bisected into small parts at a film school to teach students what not to do.

for years i hesitated watching this movie. now, i know why. not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny, but there's also just nothing to laugh *at* about the movie. it was even worse than i'd expected. i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money. i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much. it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. i have used imdb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or, worse, buying this stinker!! really a waste of time and money. i must say that the plot line is awful.

this movie is perfect for any aspiring screen writer, actor or director. by watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today. there are so many clichés that it pained me to sit through this movie. nothing about it is original and every single line spoken has been ripped off from those clichéd movies that we all saw in the 90's. although it does have a few cheap laughs, overall it is wrong wrong wrong. i was so immensely bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic i actually noticed how much make-up was caked onto tara reid's face to hide those massive bags and wrinkles from her endless partying. seriously, she was wearing so much foundation you could literally scrape it off and refill an entire bottle of it.what shocked me though was that so many of the talented and popular cast would sign on for this piece of junk. and i do not know how i sat through that horrible screaming that ashton kutcher does, you know when he's like angry or something and he shouts his words in this annoying manner? ashton's horrifying "talking", tara's face being ten shades darker than her neck, a drugged up owl, a script that seemed like the work of a three-year-old...seriously, in my whole life there has been no movie that i have watched that i did not in someway enjoy no matter how bad it was. this deserves an award for being the first. bad bad bad... i don't think there is a single word in the english dictionary that can possibly describe this trashy movie. today i was trying to re-watch it but i had to turn it off like ten minutes in because i was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clichés.don't even bother to rent this at your blockbuster, it's not worth a cent, as a matter of fact i am willing to pay anyone out there considering to watch this movie so they can go do something decent with their lives.

i have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much. it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. this is not a funny movie. i must say that the plot line is awful. i did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. the characters are not very inspired. just terribly annoying. this movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with his tyrannous boss's daughter. when he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's owl, and he thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at 6 pm. he gets to be very disappointed finding out that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend. after her father leaves home leaving precise orders, about taking care of the house and his beloved bird, appears a secretary, a renegaded son and all sort of not funny stuff happens in the house. but he finally hooks up with his boss's daughter. trust me this movie is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!

not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies. i'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that actually are boring and not to talk about ridiculous. with the millions they used to make a movie like this, because i don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum. with that money imagine how many good independent movies you could make, or maybe one good hollywood movie. its just to rip you off, but not anyone, just the majority of teens that are willing to go and see an ashton kutcher movie, just because they are fans of him. i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. if you actually look at it in prospective the actors are the same quality of this movie. so i guess i shouldn't be surprise, i actually couldn't have expected more.

this film was terrible. i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse. from the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable rom-com, but the moment he arrives at the house it just disintegrates. none of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was tom, although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while. the dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non-existent. in an insulting attempt at comedy the writer/director introduces a new character or event in practically every scene, none of which are realistic, making it very confusing to keep track of what is going on. the plot is barely an excuse for a movie : guy likes girl, house sits fathers home to get to know girl, destroys house, gets girl. a complete waste of time.

the trailer is so deceiving... i thought this will be a good film... what was the point in bringing the women in hong kong for being killed? they could have done it in paris. and the fist half hour:-you love me!-no i don't! -you love me!-no i don't! -you love me!-no i don't!repeat for 100 times... then... well i don't love you... so i shoot you! :d so here is the reason why movie piracy is a good thing! imagine if i would have even give money for this torture! i'm sorry for the time i lost watching it... the film makers should pay me for the inconvenience... worst film ever seen...

the story is disjointed and poorly written. we are given threads and a possible hook in act one, only to see it vanish. had the writer bothered reading his work carefully, it wold have been apparent that madsden's character's initial problem and meeting with the 'bad' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem.the problem goes nowhere. the relationship goes nowhere. and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. no-one digs anyone and no-one is appealing. the writing and directing is laughable. you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement. there is none. the writer/director is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie. from simple errors such as '...they took polaroids...' - in japan in 2007 ? to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism, this movie is an insult. you cannot make them much worse.and by plastering 'madsden' on the talent list, the producers thought they'd have some success. he is hardly acting. asia certainly is... and the result is some heroin-chic panto.give it a big miss.

asia argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn't a bad thing in it's self, but, when her character talks about all the guys she serviced, and to see her with michael madsen and an asian guy in the present tense of the movie, it made me feel like i needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, like a disease was going to rub off on me or something.the movie felt like it was going for a love triangle/drama/action/??? plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. the acting was great, the plot, not so great. the director needs to at least pick a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this again, because they are not very good at it obviously.

tired, garbled dreck. the chemistry between argento and madsen was as exciting as a wet doughnut. their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. the storyline was a mess. the acting forced. the cinematography lingered on the uninspired. lazy and pointless. kim gordon and her character had no reason to be there. nor did anyone else for that matter. i couldn't have given two farts for any of the 'characters'. their emotions skipped and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroin. empty and dull. why do i have to write ten lines of text on here to make my point? i think i summed it up in the first three words. but, obviously it's not enough. i think this is the last time i'll bother to waste my time critiquing a film. anyway, i saw 'clean' and thought that was quite ineffectual as well. again, i cared not for the characters, whether they lived or died.

okay, enough. every time i think i've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that i think that no one could possibly find something to praise, i just come to the imdb where i'm greeted with the usual inane "undiscovered masterpiece" "great film" - i mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess i just watched on the new fox/mgm/ua dvd. there are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning. and then, after ninety-three interminable minutes, it just stops and the end credits begin. then there's another scene. the dvd is fairly wretched, which suits the film. the source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown. it's hard to imagine this film followed get carter. the critics and the public got this one right back then - it was lambasted and a box-office disaster, and rightfully so. but you pundits keep on trying. and i'll keep on trying to find a movie that doesn't have someone who raves about it.

what bird is that ? a maltese falcon. the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael caines hair. which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. salutes to raymond chandler and humphrey bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. the reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - this film is what the title suggests...

i watched this video because i like malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. the movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. you had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. it had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.in short, i'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again. it was so bad, i actually couldn't fall asleep. there are quite a few "eurotrash" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. this is one of them. on the bright side, who is nadia cassini? never before have i seen a more beautiful set of legs. she is the one saving grace of this movie.disturbing, too, was the cruel boar hunt depicted in the closing credits. a boar that was released on someone's property (malta has very few native mammals; all of them small - rats, bats, etc.) and then set upon by dogs before it was shot. oh, well - go visit malta anyway despite this film - it's a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.

dryly irreverent, but sadly unfunny satire of detective movies, with stony-faced michael caine playing a british author of trashy crime stories traveling to the mediterraean to assist in writing the memoirs of a would-be gangster; soon, he realizes he's being followed and his life is in danger. caine narrates the proceedings with considerable sly wit and low-keyed sarcasm, but his actual performance is bereft of energy (caine's shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere, and he connects with nobody on the screen). other cast members (particularly mickey rooney, a silver-haired lionel stander, and lizabeth scott) do very well in colorfully outré roles, though al lettieri has an insulting part as an apparent cross-dressing homosexual (lettieri gets insulted without being able to defend himself, an unenviable position). writer-director mike hodges has the germ of a good idea (satirize the detective movies of the 1940s without compromising the hard-boiled talk and milieu), but he hasn't a very sharp sense of humor. when a bogart lookalike--asking a question about a falcon--is the best joke, what follows is anemic indeed. ** from ****

one of the worse gay-related movies i have ever seen. since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. therefore, since colton ford (aka glen) laid his life open for all to see, i guess he's fair game to criticize. and that's not hard to do. here goes. 50 something glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (i guess 11 films makes him a "star") being gay and forty, i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover. personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles. face it, guys, he's no jeff stryker, jim bently or casey donovon. that's ok, though. the purpose of these films takes place in about 6.5 minutes, so they all pretty much have the same requirements, if you know what i mean.so glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. i wonder why? was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film. and according to the film it's not just porn flicks he indulges in, it's living in a house with other "stars" where people can hook into their bedroom, the bathroom and where ever via webcams . it's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party. strip gigs at clothing optional "hotels". doing something called meth which i presume is a drug. and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you ---- because he's "legit" now. oy!the only interesting, non-cardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name. and considering this is a documentary, well, porn is as porn does. you can tell he's most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star.glen has one hyper-nellie manager (kyle) who wants to "sell' him as a porno-participant in hopes of getting him gay-club gigs. he tries to do the svengalli-routine. "wear this" "don't smile" "say this" in what amounts to controlling issues. but our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. that's the first mistake. i'm not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager, they're not going to get far. kind of like: he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.all of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information. drum roll, please. he's bad. he sucks. his singing talent ranks up there with ashlee simpson. it's hard to root for someone who -- while trying make his dream come true --- at 50! --- doesn't work like normal people. no job. can you say lazy-ass? and the whining, and the "why don't they accept me." song and dance. and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he spouts off, "why don't i have a record deal by now." what? actors are waiters. writers work in low-level newspapers or mags -- whatever. this guy is above that. it's true. he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it. whine. whine whine. his lover leaves him to return to nursing but i tell ya i wouldn't want that moron dispensing medical care to me. both of them were useless. airheads. the movie is useless. unless you really like whine and cheeesy people stay away. do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people, there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.

for the first fifteen minutes the story of naked fame is interesting: two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting. the two very buff and preening men are colton ford and blake harper. with the aid of kevin aviance and marc berkely, colton makes a dance track that is then marketed in new york with the hopes that colton ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer touting his background as a porn star for pr.the remainder of the film is grumbling and in-fighting and commentary by porn producer chichi larue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and doldrums. not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away form a successful career (though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost) into an alternative one. it is just that a one-note song wears thin quickly. grady harp, november 05

this is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party i go to. it is clear from the start that steve gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. i think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. sean bean "acted" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was. some actors do not look good scruffy. some actors should not bulk up for a part. those two statements apply to "police academy" steve. his scruffy look translates to bum and indigent and his bulking up makes him look potato lumpy not buff. pair that with one of the worst scripted dialogues in hollywood history and you have bad movie. i can only guess that all of the principles really really needed the money for remodeling or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys that must of typed it out. i would love to know the back story to this disaster.

**might contain spoilers**ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. two words? really bad. now why do i think that? let me explain. guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. they do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. however, suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. after debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved. after deciding they cant trust their bosses, they decide to, once again, steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers.in theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low-budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv. however, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts. firstly, the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes. second. the acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act as dummys. there aren't many emotions, change of facial expressions at all etc. i was especially disappointed in guttenberg that i believe can do so much more, but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action-hero. in addition, though i am not by any means any expert on the subject, i totally believe i could assemble a better covert-ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week. this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible. this go for good guys, bad guys and bystanders as well. then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. for example, i have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and i didn't break instantly.don't know how to conclude this really, but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do. sorry, can't be any nicer than that. do not watch this movie, it is not even so bad it is funny. 2/10

a cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer, airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think of how low former '80's comedy golden boy steve guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production (and playing a hard man too!). the plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, not bad of its kind but not in the same league (obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as air force one and con air. the cast is good though, with sean bean reprising his brit.-bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as goldeneye and patriot games.

*****i reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****oh my, this is bad. and for some reason, sean bean, one of the greatest present day actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. the only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as steve guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as sean bean. instead, he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end, by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by bean, but was actually his boss and faked his own death. don't worry. i haven't ruined anything for you. the acting itself is spectacularly apalling, with guttenberg's patented "hey-look-i-can-pull-a-chuck-norris-face" hard man stare dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth. added to a plot that i could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong, while another moment, steve guttenberg is bravely running around with it, throwing, catching bashing and generally abusing this 'virus' which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath. my final word? if you are suicidally depressed and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse isn't, tape it next time it's on channel 5 at midnight, then burn it when you realise that i am indeed telling the truth.

this film suffers horrendously from its direction "julian grant" , and its incompetent lead, steve guttenberg, who's putting a solid effort to win a bruce willis look-alike contest! the writing is reckless hollywood action thriller; sean bean --whose one of my favorites-- david fraser, and kim coates give a decent performance. the film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! i wonder what hollywood studios thought, actually giving the go ahead, to weak director such as grant. and i'd say to sean bean "what were you thinking even considering participating in a film like this, after such great films like goldeneye, ronin, and patriot games!

i love most movies and i'm a big fan of sean bean so i thought that i would at least like this movie. also, i'm canadian and this is a mostly-canadian movie so i was prepared to cut it some serious slack. nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is "airborne". steve guttenberg as an action hero? give me a break. the acting throughout the movie was so bad i am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. i now have only two wishes in my life.1. i hope that you never have to sit through this movie. 2. i wish i could get those 6 hours back. oh wait, the movie's under 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours...don't watch this. seriously.

it is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial "wake-up call". and, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. however, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. such is the case with martin lawrence. frankly, i pay little attention to celebrities as i have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. so, i was unaware of the majority of what lawrence had gone through prior to this film. it was interesting but, unfortunately, all to common. i was left with the larger impression that this guy's stand-up act just wasn't very funny. save the big life messages for a book, just be funny on stage. if you want to see a funny martin lawrence, go rent some of the old def jams for which he hosted. don't rent runteldat.

martin lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are long gone. runteldat shows a man who at once tries to play the sympathy card to his plight yet takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it'll benefit his ego. the sad truth is that at this point in his life, his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star left and to today he faces a career of voice acting and god awful action films.one gets the impression that this concert film wasn't made to give lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both trying to pathetically salvage what remained of his life and somehow twist it into something to be proud of, some defining moment in which he showed himself to have 'earned' his fame. sadly, the concert is nothing but a gravelly-voiced martin incoherently trying to be funny, invoke pathos, and then claim he doesn't care about it at all because hardcore. the sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for lawrence: the way he rambles on invoking sad pity laughter makes you wish that he would just strip down to his underwear on stage, wave a gun around, and just reenact it all over again. there is no real insight to his performance at all. much like the childish title states, martin is trying to make his ultimate moment of truth his own in his way and fails miserably. he would have been better off waiting for the e! true hollywood story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot out of himself for the second time.perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film--or rather, career eulogy--is that martin didn't put any thought into this. what was this film supposed to prove? sadly, that his fame was fleeting, he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way he can get work is piggybacking will smith or a pixar production. they might as well called this concert 'tombstone' because that's what it is. martin lawrence just dies on stage here, and with it goes what could have been an interesting career. now? just a pathetic side note in history.

to paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you're a stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! my basic question is, being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were, why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? this movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant. joe de rita, despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly, shemp, or even joe besser. if that's who moe and larry had left to pick from, they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years. leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier. always leave them laughing is the motto for comedy and always quit while you're on top. hence seinfeld's leaving the sitcom while right up there, instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline.

barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport. she's in a heap of trouble, i won't say what exactly, and even american extraterritoriality won't help her out.i mention that because one of the grievances that the chinese including the bandits who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution whereby american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american courts set up by our consulates. we were far from the only country doing that however.anyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent. the accent intrigues warner baxter who's pretty plastered.bandits however interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the american consulate presided over by charles winninger. he's the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character. he's a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by william mckinley. he requested a transfer ten years later and that's the last he was heard from. as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale aptly put it, he's the real forgotten man.baxter does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm. the heroics would have come more natural to gable than to baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against the bandits.alice faye did have one number to sing. why alice's song was cut out, god and zanuck only know. one thing i'm still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final refuge in the cellar with a trap door, just who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door? barricade had the potential to be a lot better than it was. but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made 20th century fox release a project unfulfilled. watching barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal.
