where on earth do i start with the mess that is darkhunters? firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or tv screen and can only be described as a poorly judged stephen king rip-off. at one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter jack claims that carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as "a gherkin in a burger". i would be laughing if i was making it up-but i'm not! just as ludicrous is how carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. a cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid. what????????secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. this may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark, broad daylight. not very atmospheric at all.thirdly the acting is truly awful, pinion proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable. jeff fahey is obviously on auto-pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe-ful humphry bogart impersonation as barlow (marlowe-barlow? we get the joke it just isn't funny). credit should go to susan paterno, an actress i was not aware of, she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other, more experienced actors to shame.at no point is it even explained how the human character can understand what van husen's character is saying to her. she obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages.on the plus side one moment is well done, the car crash involving susan. the sfx are throughly believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded.all i can say about darkhunters is that british horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown. avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague would be a lot more scary.darkhunters 0/5p.s. the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious. it is a weak defence when some claim "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". the letters after my name make a fool of you not me.

hey guys and girls! don't ever rent, or may god forbid, buy this piece of garbage. i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. in fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in darkhunters. the story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc. i can't actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film.. maybe except all the cats, which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute. please, use your money on other things than on this film.... i couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the film, it was that terrible.. if anyone really liked this film, i would really like to hear from you, and i will try to see if i can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist's office near you..0 out of 10, actually below if possible.. not worth the dvd or tape it is on..

i don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. you got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? and they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? the script already has a hole in it the size of nebraska, then you have the main character played by susan paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot. it's absolutely horrendous and i don't even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie. the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you, and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever. they might as well have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo."

it's a shame. there's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. the plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. it should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap darth maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors. not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel it into obscurity.


"yesterday" as a movie, is hard to rate. the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. the story is gritty and real and does not compromise. but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.as a person who was born and raised in central africa, i appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu. but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film. it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of "yesterday". unlike the 1980 film "the gods must be crazy", which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology, "yesterday" has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience. the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind - and i doubt it was intended for the western mind. the scenes are long and slow, the editing is not paced for a 60mph+ instant gratification world. the dialog is not cleaver or witty, it is real. movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment, it is education.this movie is best viewed by those who know, appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub-sarah africa. if you lack a broad enough world-view to understand other cultures, especially african cultures, should skip this film. do not waste you time with it. go see "talladega nights" or "larry the cable guy" instead for your cross culture viewing.i give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures. for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world, i would give it a 7.

i'm pretty sure poe would have considered this a travesty. the first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. and then there's toby dammit. what on earth was fellini thinking? it's a rambling, random, dull piece, with little to recommend it. one should feel frustrated at the lack of backstory or conclusion, but there's only relief that it's over.

what is it about the french? first, they (apparently) like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does. second, they (seem) to like edgar allan poe's work more than just about anyone else does. it's got to be the "beaudelaire effect".don't get me wrong...i'm a poe fan myself. but this trilogy manages to make three of poe's below-average stories into...well, i'm not sure what they're made into."toby dammit" is a fine fellini film, but it has nothing to do with poe's story, at least in terms of theme. it's enjoyable on the first viewing. terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role. however, it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead."metzergenstein" is a big mess. how did vadim's films get produced? it's just awful...not even up to amateur film school standards. depending on the dvd menu you have, try to skip it and save your time."william wilson" is actually the segment that is most faithful to poe's work. it does not have much style, though, even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film. (it looks like the boys are throwing tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs, that have been rolled up into balls.) my advice is to skip "metzergenstein", watch "william wilson", and then, if you're a fellini fan (i'm not) keep "toby dammit" on while you cook dinner or make a snack.

it's reassuring to see that other imdb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great vadim, malle and fellini.these directors may be talented & artistic in their own right; however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as *in any way* related to edgar allen poe's stories, they exposed themselves as frauds. either (a) they didn't bother to read the poe stories, or (b) they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn't pay poe any mind.imagine if metallica plugged in their guitars, cranked the amps up to 11 and moshed out 3 chords claiming it to be beethoven's 9th symphony. that's the feeling you'll get after sitting through this film. if you're a vadim/malle/fellini fan (metallica), you'll dig it. if you're a beethoven fan (poe), you'll puke.metzergenstein...here we begin with a bizarre porno version of poe. ok, "porno" may be a bit extreme haha, but at the very least you have to call it a barbarella version (including, i don't doubt, some of jane's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp). vadim falls into old clich√©s of his own: the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow-cam we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. cute stuff, but "metzergenstein" ain't the place for it. and in addition to the barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, jane fonda's awful american accent and unconvincing performance as a european countess made this the worst casting since julia roberts in that lousy version of dr. jekyll & mr. hyde.william wilson...here's a great poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. if you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, go watch star trek episode #27 "the alternative factor". but here, malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on... any guesses...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. ho hum. brigitte bardot's role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end, and once again the director distorts a classic poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues. do it on your own time, malle. i thought we're here on poe's dime.toby dammit....the absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film i've seen since "staying alive". at least fellini showed some tact in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humour of the story is so vast, i wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies, stamped "edgar allen poe story" on it and submitted it to this collection. i strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with poe's works, but there was absolutely none.the original poe story ("never bet the devil your head") is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims "i'll bet the devil my head..." on a foggy morning, the devil takes him up on his offer. the result is the sickest and silliest thing you've ever read. this was poe, the comedian, at his finest (yes, poe wrote many comedies. also check out "a predicament" and "devil in the belfry" if you want a taste of his witty, satirical works).this fellini version? it's bland, soulless, and not funny at all (unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes). here fellini's egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. most of it is set at an awards ceremony where fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic "sour grapes" attitude that we find in all fellini films dealing with cinema. note the sarcastic jabs at "the critics", a recurring theme in fellini's films. for someone who considered himself above the critics, fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them. at any rate, i feel like fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1/2, spliced them together and sold it as a poe story. worst "adaptation" ever.i think i put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a poe movie.

i saw this film in the movie theater. i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. it is a woodward film about one of second city's native sons.everyone knew about johns history. everyone knew how he died. some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.but hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.this movie. well. forget the idea of poor michael chilklis (who is a really great actor) being in a really astonishingly bad film, and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man.forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of belushi's work...and all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie.screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob woodwards work. kinda saying "okay...we are about to mess with belushi...now lets go after woodward too..." they also decided to take the premise of it's a wonderful life and turn it into it's a horrible life on crack.is he a guardian angel or the devil? is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device...how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie? it is one of those movies after it is over...you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go "what the hell was that?!" in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic. but for good reason.a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw out snappy one liners) to the screen. a cult film is never good. and most people would never watch them in any serious context.if you want to watch some classic bad late 80's fair stoned? rent wired. if you want to know about john belushi...you can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie.

this could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! i had this film when i was a theater manager. when i put the film together, and watched it, i thought i had some reels out of order. as it turned out i didn't, and if i did, nobody would have noticed. i couldn't figure out what's going on! everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way!

"wired" would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen. the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and i'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film.it fails to work either as a tribute to belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. a pointless mess with no redeeming features.

look, this film is terrible... the "plot" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. eventually the kids engineer ex-convict beverly d'angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? and d'angelo watches a tv talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. it's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny. in fact the announcer slated this film before it came on the tv channel i was watching! just don't bother wasting a single moment of your life on this pile of complete trash, y'hear?

this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.the story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the "gray" characters turn "good" and the "bad" guys get their just desserts and *boom* ... it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.which wouldn't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place. but such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess.my advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes ... and then shut it off. at this point, imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far.believe me, the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends. trust me on this.

what crack are you smoking? this movie, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! the action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad. the colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. the ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning. and when joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, i just about peed myself. i could go on...entertaining, arguably so. good, no. well made, certainly not.as a commentary on america as empire, it's actually pretty good. joe as a typical white conqueror isn't all that surprising, especially in the context of mid-1980s american cinema.

for many year i saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture i can only think this is just another karate film. a black shinobi and some weapons doesn't make a ninja, it's much more than that. the ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything, killing whatever try to stop them. this movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand.

michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u.s army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner, which is hampered by too many long pauses without action, but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james' performance.

i couldn't stop laughing, i caught this again on late night tv. "i suppose you think you're some kind of hero for bringing my daughter back alive" "no" "good"haha.

this review contains a spoiler---the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts. he falls for the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the "people's hero" at the end of the film. this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched. it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality. good for kids under 14. the military errors in this film is comical. i remember during my three years in the military, us privates were not required to salute or call nco's "sir", the film does this in various spots. the colonel's hair is way too long on the ears. the master sergent's moustache was against military protocol in length. on the post, the colonel was the only officer around. not one other officer was shown walking around the post. you had idiot ninjas brandshing swords against troops with m-16's, rather poorly made.folks this filmed reeked. michael dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts. the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. avoid this film

i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. living in taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in america. i have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. i seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. how sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what i thought should have been titled "generic ninja fight scene, op. 1" or "variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girl's head when backed into a corner" or the daring "flight of the helicopter". then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled. those actually had me in tears laughing. if the "special effects" weren't proof enough that this was low-budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably locals which although good for the much-needed phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money, have ever done anything since this series of movies. they rented equipment, despite making sequels to this movie. that was pretty funny too. the thing that really had me going though, was not the music (which left me half expecting an animated sargeant slaughter from g.i. joe to pop up), but the ending...i suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil, but when the american ninja drops the girl into jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch him.i think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.

any of law & order's, csi (take your choice of city), and homicide: life on the street's weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of bones.david boreanaz is stuck in crappy angel mode, and emily deschanel portrays "bones" too... unrealistically. the actors as a whole have terrible scenes together, be it with forced acting, or just awful lines.the murders become predictable after a while, as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious.music is okay, though really unnecessary at times.all in all, bones is hardly the show i'd recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon-copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever-dulling stories.skip this if you can.

one chinese gang attacks and wipes out another gang in the beginning of the film. unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. oddly, and without any discernible reason, the gang solicits a volunteer to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me, so sending this one guy away just seemed silly, but that's the plot. later, when this man comes home, betrayals and scheming have occurred--leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop killing.if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot, then you should probably skip this movie, as its practically non-stop action and practically no plot or character development--even when compared to other martial arts films. i would estimate that 80-90% of the film are fight scenes--endless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives. again and again and again, fight scenes! if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are slashed, kicked, and slashed, then this is the film for you. the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest!! deep it ain't, but if you want to see excitement and action only, then this film is for you! by the way, this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end. and, when they finally do the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is really, really lame! logical errors like this and the lady's suicide (why???) make this a "turn off your brain" type of film.

incident on and off a mountain road is don coscarelli's entry in mick garris' masters of horror series. coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the phantasm series and the irresistibly weird bubba ho-tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this tv episode. the plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. this time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. after a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac. the whole chase sequence is really ridiculous, with the young lady stopping every so often to set traps; only for the maniac to show up seconds later, and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband - who just happens to have a wealth of information on how escape insane killers; with lines such as "expect the unexpected". the only real highlight for me was the presence of phantasm's tall man, angus scrimm. coscarelli tries his best to implement as much horror imagery as possible; with things such as a rotted corpse of a dead baby - but because it's all so silly on the whole, it's difficult to take this piece seriously. this is the first episode in the series, and the first that i've seen; i really hope they get better.

"you can survive anything". anything except a dumb horror flick. the director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. you can't have both. it's like michael moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of "docu-comedies": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. some genres cannot be mixed."anything can happen to anyone, any time, any place." (translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) this sounds not so much like something "wise" found on a paper of a chinese fortune cookie, but more like the credo of every bad horror film director. we get this baloney of a statement served to us early on, sort of as a preparation/justification of the absurd buffoonery to come."my phone isn't working!" well, of course it isn't. there is a far greater chance that sean penn's brain starts working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than that a horror-film cell-phone does. the single most dreary and predictable horror clich√© of the past decade. why even say it? we know help will never come via a phone-call, so ye horror-making dimwits might as well just not even mention it. the last 50 horror films i saw use this plot device. it's becoming embarrassing."you always have to expect the unexpected." the final twist was rather surprising, i'll give them that much... however, plenty of nonsense on the way there.check out the elaborate traps the heroine sets up with the speed of a drugged-up lab rat - in the cold, wet, and almost totally dark conditions. i just love horror-film realism...when a blood-thirsty demon starts trying to be funny (by "shshshing" his victims) then you know your horror-viewing pleasure is in doubt. the less said about the old geezer "cracking wise", the better... another stupid clich√© served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director.what are the odds of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye-hating demon - on the same day? "expect the unexpected". they might as well have squeezed in an event in which she survives a plane crash, and then another in which she encounters aliens who tried to anal-probe her...the fast-forward button needs a temple or a shrine built in its image.

"marar√≠a" really disappointed me. i can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. dr. ferm√≠n displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. i mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with marar√≠a?? maybe once? also, marar√≠a never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, that of marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the canary islands, and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.

i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating. this was a big disappointment. this doesn't hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the dead,day of the dead, land of the dead etc. horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going, you have to build up the characters so when they snuff it,you feel some empathy etc but even so, there's a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse, up to that point,its like watching a bad soap opera, nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first time,you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes, you won't miss anything plot- wise. when things do get going, its all very sub-par stuff. some of the kills and make up are done well, others are done very poorly, consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting i've ever seen.this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired, firebombs being let off,no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air, c'mon, we're not all simpletons.oh, and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jet's missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away. i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility. one to miss.

i never really thought about watching this film. i kept seeing it perched on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental shop and never thought much about it. just your run of the mill, bland zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene. nothing special, might as well watch python...oh no wait, that's a terrible film.i only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on tv and said it was an awful piece of trash. so, i decided to verify these tales, and only then did i realise how terrible the film hiding behind the bland and uninteresting dvd box cover was.not that the idea is bad in itself. a plane is a confined area, and would be a real death trap for the people on board should zombies make their appearance...a good premise for a zombie film. but this film took a good setting and crapped all over it with poor acting, unsteady camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score.the characters all have different levels of hatefulness. there are two young couples who are basically friends going on a vacation in france. one couple is composed of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who is having an affair with mr jock's best friend, who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho. there is also a policeman escorting a con-man (an effeminate and highly annoying con-man). the policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters of the lot. then there is a bunch of air hostesses who mostly end up as zombie chow...no i didn't watch the whole film, it was just too painful an experience to carry through, almost as bad as watching cannibal holocaust. oh and there's also a golfer on holiday with his wife, some strange air marshal who really does not appear to be important until he's summoned to help deal with the zombie escapees, a trio of scientists who all fall victim to the undead and a couple of pilots. the camera work is often shaky, and although many people don't seem to mind, it can really get on your nerves after a while, like having a small fly buzz constantly around your head. it's small but it's there and it's annoying.the adulterous couple are genuinely annoying. all they do is have sex in the plane's toilets while their spouses aren't looking...in fact all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying. they whine, bitch, argue and have some of the most inane and mind-buggeringly boring dialogue in the movie...yes, it makes you glad to see them die.the score is atrocious. it is so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of suspense a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. in fact, it sounds like the score from...python! that film will never stop haunting me.there is also a character that the film makers seemed incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible. a nun, sitting near the young adults and clutching her bible who is included in so many shots you start to wonder if she plays any major part in the film...but no she doesn't, so why have her in so many scenes? was it because the film's creator's original project was a nun porn flick? nobody will ever know.the zombies look pretty good. their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters, they are far more convincing and likable! the guard responsible for keeping an eye on the scientist's illegal cargo was quite funny. a large crate appears to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some kind of sharp object...yet he doesn't scream, wince or moan in pain. he just grunts and squirms in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg...in fact he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain.ah well, all in all i give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies.watch this movie only if you like young adults bickering and throwing things at each other, and sadly, there really isn't anything funny about the whole thing so watching for a laugh would probably fail, unless you're high on some kind of psychoactive drug.

this review contains spoilers.i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead. i already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of snakes on a plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so i figured i didn't really have much to lose.the music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although i did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie. it started off surprisingly well, the opening scenes weren't too bad, some of the acting was a little cringe-worthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would be.it all goes well until laura cayouette (rocket from kill bill: vol. 2) enters the picture. she is supposed to be playing a scientist. if she is, she's not a very bright one. luckily she's polished off pretty quickly.i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the plane during some turbulence. there was a nun. have you ever been on a plane with a nun!? i was surprised she wasn't clutching a crucifix.finally, after 35 minutes, we get to some zombie action, and use the word 'action' loosely. the special effects are pretty below standard, but that's to be expected from a movie with this budget. being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie though, it makes you look pretty amusing. using slow motion doesn't work particularly well either. i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story. trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" wasn't an especially good move either considering malaria isn't a virus.the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie. most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive. possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly inconceivable ending. i know it's a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living, but the ending was just ridiculous. rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ

if you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. it fails at the first post by not being scary or funny. it is a dull grey movie that i guess went straight to video. hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. if you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch diary of the dead. poor special effects, school level script. zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . this movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores. this is as thrilling and convincing as a republican convention, no sorry watching the republican convention would be a better example of a zombie movie.

i'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. this movie focused more on a "let's just make it gory" view.the movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. i wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively. and the original zombie lady, kelly or something, displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick. i laughed quite hard when she died. deserved it in every way.i was a little confused as to why dr. kelly could talk after becoming a zombie, but then there wasn't anything uttered by another zombie because annoying screams and shrieks. and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen, yet when dr. bennett is expelled from the airplane and into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live at the end.i kinda felt that they altered things to make a "good" scene. when one of the bitchy girlfriends (i didn't take the time to learn their names. they played a pointless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. was it a two-way mirror to watch mile-high clubbers? i've never broken a mirror on an airplane (bad luck and all that) but i doubt there is that much room behind there, with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and all.the few redeeming qualities were too little too late, sadly. one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight attendants, yet they felt the need to kill all but one off. and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady chomps down on frank's arm and he says "she's gumming me to death" or something to that degree.honestly, i'm sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie. the fact that i bought it underage kinda redeems that but still... it failed on so many levels. stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later.

this movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie. there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks. for instance, there were like 50 people on the plane, they killed like 100 and they kept coming, apparently the "virus" gives hepatic complications because everybody had yellow eyes, also the virus makes people roar like lions or something, and the virus not only regenerates tissue as it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes up peoples hair. it's also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only happens on planes) that person is kicked back in the air. remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and you loose him, always look inside the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle, you never know where those bastards are going to hide. and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (happens all the time), after watching dozens of people being killed, just walk away from the plane, watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant. :)

..."flight of the living dead" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director scott "i'm a producer, can'tcha tell?" thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because i feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-dvd release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like richard "three o'clock high" tyson, erick "stargate" avari, and raymond j. "little children" barry, and a slew of others not so recognizable, "fold" is predominantly populated with cardboard, most of which ends up soaked in unconvincing fake blood. there are a few (precious few) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie trapped in his seat both come to mind), but most of the scripting is pedestrian and comic-book stupid, and i am here to assure you that we're talking pedestrian and stupid. you'll never for a second believe that "fold" is anything but a cheap cash-in movie with pretensions of cool. god forbid it ever spawn the sequel its idiotic ending promises.strictly freebie viewing, depending on how impecunious your local library is, and otherwise suitable for insomniacs and the indiscriminate only.

i don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. i'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. really, actually, i should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. production is... well, okay. barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clich√©s, and an abrupt ending. go ahead and like zombie movies, but don't ever give this above a 5.0. honestly though, the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh. seriously.

it's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. the paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. case in point: flight of the living dead (or, as i quickly came to know it, shite of the living dead). there's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes. i've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways. in fact, in the xlibris book the night riders, co-written with m. kelley, i dedicate it, in part, to "the six writers whose work inspires me still: richard matheson, harlan ellison, shirley jackson, edgar allen poe, h.p. lovecraft, and robert e. howard." had it been a motion picture, i would've dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years. very high up on that list would've been george romero. it's nothing less than a crying shame that the makers of this film weren't truly as inspired by romero as their title suggests.

this has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. the plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. the "special effects" ( spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. i have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end. the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me.. i'm sorry for my bad english.. i am from romania ( and this is my first post ). i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just can't believe that this is a movie released in 2007.

an obvious cash-in on the *insert monster here* on a plane gimmick, flight of the living dead is about what you'd expect it to be. the film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. although, it is fun in parts, i must say. the zombie-action is particularly entertaining. once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.the practical special effects are pretty good, but the cgi is terrible and distracting. the ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel. let's hope that doesn't come to fruition. if you're a die-hard fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror films, i'd recommend it to you; it's worth at least one watch. however, if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. 3/10

this movie is so over-the-top as to be a borderline comedy. laws of physics are broken. things explode for no good reason. great movie to sit down with a six-pack and enjoy. do not - i repeat do not see this movie sober. you will die horrible death!!!

not much to say other than plenty of wire-fu and supposed sholin monks ego-tripping about kung-fu and caricature japanese plotting to take over china. all of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake japanese sword fighting. if you watched a samurai movie or two you can tell that the "japanese" fighting in the movie is simply the same "kung-fu" (really circus acrobats) stunt men doing the same things except with a japanese sword. however, there are a couple of fun moments such as when a japanese woman ninja tears off her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net. storywise, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as whether the japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions. the "japanese" protagonist is shown as largely honourable but not beyond unwarranted cruelty such as when he murders a sedated monk so that he may have his duel. quite disappointing with a very silly ending. does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle.

i actually liked certain things about this game. i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. the graphics really weren't bad, but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. the music was fine. the things i hated were: the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. the inability to save was awful!!! some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. i thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. this game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. play it at your own risk.

this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen. the visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent black and white to color switch. i also thought that the story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clich√©d action movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. i could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? i can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do. over all truly the worst i have ever seen, you thought disney was bad? i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing because i'm sure i could guess the outcome, and the visual were the worst i have ever seen.

if you thought nbc's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that fx reached into the bowels of made-for-tv hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. the filming style was the now overused "docu-action" look, complete with cuts to grainy b&w "rawcore" footage. i'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the dp said to the director before filming. i don't know what they were going for here but it reminded me of the guy at the office who thinks powerpoint presentations with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool."the story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in southern ca. that's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there's security precautions up the ying-yang. for the sake of reality, they put 2 off-duty chippies in the mix. because, they'd be able to stop 6 people, right? six. i mean, even bruce willis had to deal with more terrorists over at that stupid nakatomi building.leslie hope (tv's teri bauer) plays a chp officer who has problems talking on the phone after she's shot in her bullet-proof vest. her voice sounds like a sally struther's tv ad, whiny and monotonous. her character is only a plot device, and after she performs her one small duty, she is promptly disposed of. yes, teri bauer is died! bruce greenwood stars as fbi s.a.c. tom shea, who continually points out how he punches foreign diplomats in the face. his boss is out, so nobody over at the dept. of homeland security believes his prognosis of the situation. he's the sensible one out of a group of paranoid public officials afraid of taking blame for any type of catastrophe. he's calm, he's strong, he's boring.there is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about meltdown - ok, well maybe teri bauer getting died was pretty unnecessary and funny - other than that, nothing redeeming.

director jeremiah checheck who brought us big budget debacles like "the avengers" and the remake of "diabolique" has directed this ripoff of the die hard concept, done on - what looks like - a blair witch budget. a california nuclear reactor is overtaken by arab terrorists. but - are you ready? - the terrorists aren't arab; they're really disgruntled american soldiers masquerading as arabs! we find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. we're not sure what the statement is but never mind. so there's really no threat. but then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow up the plant because he's kind of crazy. so maybe there is a threat after all. but the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed. so there was no threat. oh, and a good guy is killed too. let that be a lesson to everybody.if all of this sounds muddled and kinda of a waste of time then you got the idea of what watching meltdown is all about.the script never bothers to introduce the characters or to even give any personal details that might flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience. so we're left with one dimensional characters: the-expert-that-nobody-will-listen-to; the-trigger-happy-sergeant; the-slimy-politicians; the-dweeby-engineers. the story skips from one clich√© incident to the next in a formula composite of practically every action movie you've ever seen. but at nearly every turn, just when we think something may be at stake the script flinches and we find out there's actually nothing to worry about.like die hard, there's an police officer who's on the inside, unbenownst to the bad guys. the big twist is that the cop here is....a woman! oh and she's injured too. but not that bad, just enough to make her wince a couple times. oh and instead of the walkie talkie that bruce willis had this cop has a magic cell phone that works everywhere...even underground! when he's not yelling at everybody else bruce greenwood - his jaw made out of granite - tries to soothe her over the walkie talkie. he even makes a joke once but we're afraid his face might crack. after all, this is serious business.but mostly it's scene after scene of people arguing: the military expert is arguing to wait it out (his reasoning doesn't seem particularly sound but he's supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people at the white house argue with him; the army sergeant argues with him too; the nice pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist. the dialogue is absolutely b movie all the way and lines like, "stop the broadcast! stop the broadcast!!!" may have you in rolling off your sofa as you wonder if the characters are actually referring to this silliness.maybe to compensate for the lack of production quality the camera-work is kept jittery in that faux documentary 21 grams style that's supposed to lend immediacy and energy to the scenes but the way it's indiscriminately and amateurishly applied here it's downright annoying; even pretentious. further attempts to ratchet up the tempo are made with the inclusion of nonsensical black and white footage that's randomly intercut with the main action. but this, too, is pretentious and annoying in that blair witch kinda way. in short, the stylistic attempts look very amateurish.the music lives up to the visuals - it's synthy and cheap sounding. sort of like a porn movie but with less melody and lots more heart beat sounds. the graphic treatment is howlingly bad too: cheesy graphics in huge red font scream out to us "9:28 pm" as though the timeclock actually makes some kind of difference.meltdown may work as a marketing concept but it's clear that the script was a second thought. fx - part of fox - put this cheesy production together and dropped several million dollars on it. now that's what i call a meltdown!

while not as bad as some movies (like the horrible "atomic twister"), "meltdown" still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. i am currently studying nuclear engineering in the pursuit of a masters degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry.riding the false fear that a chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an american plant, the movie states that any meltdown (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the movie) would mean disaster for the area. in fact, a partial meltdown in an american plant, while destroying the core, would not pose any risk to the surrounding area. three mile island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released into the environment at all, thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and core design used in this country paired with substantial containment. the security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie furthest from the truth. at any important strategic location -- be it power plant, chemical plant, military base, anything -- you will never see personnel responding to an alarm by milling around talking as if it were an unannounced drill. this is especially true at a nuclear plant, where, upon the sounding of the alarm, the reactors would be scramed immediately, shutting them off. scraming can be done with the push of a button in the control room (you do not need to put the core in "shutdown mode" like depicted in the movie), and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being brought back up to power within about 9 hours of a scram. so if this scenario played out in real life, the assailants would not be able to cause a significant meltdown. in theory, they could still cause a partial one due to residual heat if they exposed the core immediately, but that would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant -- there are many more than the single backup pumps they speak of in the movie.as for the spent fuel pools, it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up, but this is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. the fuel is under (approximately) 18 feet of highly purified water. the water cannot become radioactive (no radioactive steam like they speak of in the movie). particles dissolved in water can, but the water itself cannot; thus the reason for very thorough purification. so the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. this is no easy task as water is very heavy, and the pools are below ground with very thick concrete walls. the explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel (which is securely fastened). and there would have to be a heck of a lot of explosives, as water is *very* hard to move through an explosion. even if this were to occur, spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death toll as mentioned in the movie, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread.  from a basic movie standpoint, i grew somewhat tired of the style used. the constant fading in and out, use of gritty black and white, and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish. the characters were one-dimensional, especially those in the us government. i have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie, but will not discuss it as it would be a major spoiler.overall, 3/10

this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch. i just don't like that so-called "realistic" camera work that is being done nowadays; you know the type- jumping off center, panning around, etc. what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene. i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead. maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint.

i gave it a rating of 3 out of 10.and what's sad is, i made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so i wouldn't miss seeing it. i wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, barbara wilson. as a lesbian, i expected to love this film.i don't know how ms. wilson felt about the film, but i found it a major disappointment.it should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - set in spain, and the main character, cassandra, is a language translator who gets contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers cassandra a great deal of money to locate her ex-husband, ben.there are secrets galore revealed, but for some reason it just didn't matter. it was like, oh, so what. i could not get involved with these characters or come to care about them, or feel for them. i couldn't even identify with these characters.i think a large part of the film's failure was the actress playing the main character. she looked old, tired, worn out, and as dull as dishwater. her hair was a perpetual mess, her baggy clothes were boring, and she just was not appealing or interesting.the best part of the film was getting to hear a dean martin recording, but even that was ruined by the weird make-up worn by the man who was dancing and lip-synching to the song. believe me - it was nothing like getting to see the suavely handsome mr. martin performing it.the ending is so syrupy you'll wish you had some pancakes to go with the syrup.

whatever committee of pc enforcers is responsible for this movie has achieved something that i never thought possible: to take some truly gifted actors (davis, hardin and taylor) and make you want to insure you never encounter them in an enclosed space, ever. the sentiments that underlie the screenplay are so jejeune and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what audience would find this picture appealing, much less funny. architecture students perhaps?only one scene is visually clever: marcia gay hardin sashaying, all wriggles and rhythm, into a bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the whole of the rest of the film added up and multiplied to the tenth power. as for the other members of the cast, they probably won't want to put this one on their resumes.

some funny lines are all what makes this movie bearable. the camera tv-movie-like, the acting poor (julie davis is more than disapointing) and the directing amateurish and / or loveless. but i can understand that no one had fun to realise the overconstructed and trivial script.

comparing this movie to anything by almodovar is an insult to almodovar. the best thing i can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an almodovar movie and fails miserably. the script is dreadful, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of high-school drama (except marcia gay harden's, which is pretty good, given the material she has to work with). furthermore, the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of gaudi's architecture or the infectious charm of barcelona. if you enjoy the grit, pathos and dark, quirky comedy of almodovar's movies, you'll find none of them here. spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.

i was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. i like judy davis and juliette lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.unfortunately, i found myself dozing over and over again. judy davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. juliette lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. the plot was full of "twists" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act. and, personally, i thought marcia gay harden was totally miscast.the movie also seemed to shift about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. one reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different, and therefore decried it. all i can say is that i would have settled for the movie being *something* and sticking with it. this one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas but wasn't able to pull them all off. i give it a 4 out of 10.

in a farcical key, gaud√≠ afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. marcia gay harden and judy davis pivoted a good cast (juliette lewis' new-age freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality, i know an american young lady who squawks like her!!) but ga does not show much beyond its overtoned plot.even though movie-making is all about make believe, there were certain noticeable screenplay inconsistencies. two samples: you pay 14 euro to enter the chapel where cassandra and frankie met, never at 7 am, and you cannot leave a terrace without paying the bill (they'll charge you on the spot if they don't know you) or get off a taxi that quickly (you americans always tip cabbies even though they don't expect to, but the sequences portrayed in the movie were ridiculous). don't believe me, reader: come over and see for yourself.if you've never been here before you might not care about all this, but good movies should be believable disregarding of your origin. nobody knows about ga here, and i will make sure that does not change in the future.

admittedly, you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci-fi, and thats enough to get me interested, so if you are like that, black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it. the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch.the movie plays like the naked gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clich√©s and bad acting. unfortunately, i don't think they meant to be funny, the actors really are made of cardboard, the dialog really does suck, so well just have to laugh at them, and not with them.on a side note, it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space, half on earth, and doesn't mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors.

what a clunker!it must have been made for tv or cable.look: forget the screenplay - forget the bunch of forgettable actors. excuse me? continuity? the nsa/nia/whatever or whoever he is (an agent) takes-off in an f16 - is shown in an f18 chucking his guts up and, later, the aircraft shown taxiing is an f4 phantom! oooh, wish that i could be so cavalier.apart from the male actors(!?) the women are wasps: blue-eyed and long-legged and, eventually, get to cry about the heroes who save them. even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo- astro-nauts, the blond drops the welding tool. duh!as an sf movie one out of ten. as a movie per se: 1/2 (that's a half point). they should have ditched the space station and headed for mars.major raspberries.

well, i set out with a few friends to see this movie, we went an hour before the show started to get good seats. so as you can probably imagine we where exited to see this movie :). but that excitement soon turned to horror, this movie is a complete failure, it just try's to hard to be funny that its sad, the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it...the only good acting in the whole movie was from stefan c. schaefer who was great, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, considering that the main actors are some of iceland's best comedians it's well special...i would not recommend this movie to any one, because it try's to hard and never really delivers.

i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. the acting is ridiculous. half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen. i think there are puppet shows with more believability. they can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold. if asked to summarise the movie, i would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no-hopers at the local county-fair, slapped them on an island, added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing.i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released, recorded on dvd and costs $6 from my local video store for one day. if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film.i hate this movie with great intensity. why? i wish i knew captain, i wish i knew....

****spoiler alert**** my boyfriend, some friends, and i rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. we sort of knew what we were getting into. but the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints? its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad, with many salient details pointed out by other readers. i recommend this movie if your into cutting onions to make yourself cry.

a team of amateur journalists and tree-huggers catches wind of a secret government project, project carnivore, on a remote south pacific island. the scientists there are producing giant-sized corn, but the genes are spreading to other species, creating abnormally large komodo dragons and a cobra (one that's bullet-proof and swims underwater). with the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? even if i hadn't seen this film on the sci-fi channel (which, sadly, i did) it would scream "sci-fi channel" with its low production value, weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history. the effects here are comparable to another creature film, "raptor island", although not nearly as bad. i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films, but i haven't bothered to confirm that and probably won't. it will be a sad day when i see either of them films again.which is not to say it's not enjoyable. i watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and i can't speak for him, but i thought it was a pretty good use of time. as bad the whole thing is, it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the film (i believe the actress' name is michelle borth). michael pare also appears as a ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on "furnace" look respectable (even if that movie is intolerably bad).i can't be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be. bad effects? low budget? no-name actors? i didn't have any higher hopes. yet, this doesn't mean that it's awesome, either. coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department. for the one fan who likes this film (and calls it "kvc"), hold on to your copy because you'll have a heck of a time getting a replacement.

i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. and that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. but this is beyond bad. this movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.reviewing this is almost impossible. there are no strong points and nothing positive to say. i'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. first off, the cgi has to be one of the worst i've seen. i can't believe this movie was made in 2005, the cgi reminds me of something i might have seen in babylon 5 way back when cgi was new and fresh. it's poor beyond belief. second, the actors all seem like they belong in the worst kind of daytime soaps. and looking at their resumes i see that i'm correct... thirdly, being able to breed enormous reptiles is no match to the other technology they invented in this movie: the recoilless pistol with infinite ammo! seriously, michael par√© fires 100-200 times without reloading in every other scene... as if that was not enough there are also shape-shifting planes! at first they are regular f-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something else completely, and in the third scene they are f-16 again! if you're buying stock footage, please don't mix it like this! honestly, there is loads more to say, but i think i'll stop. you all understand what i'm saying. honestly i didn't think this kind of movie was made any more. it's like something ed wood would do. completely ignorant of quality, not caring how anything looks... it's almost amazing in all it's awfulness. if i could give it 0/10 i would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. so that's it.

i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor england.the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful. i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.first there were too many cut's between important parts. and leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with rome over his desire to divorce katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all. i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit, especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point. in the book mary give's birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born. both their father is henry's the eight. in the movie they show harry's first then catherine. and suggest that catherine father is william carey.there are too many bad moment's in the movie to write them all.i will however say that jodhi may and natascha mcelhone portrayal as the boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the movie.if you haven't read the book and know nothing about hennry's the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie. and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for it's lack of details and important plot's.

i am not a fan of the original book but was expecting to see a better adaptation than the natalie portman movie, which i found awful. this version is even worse.first, there is very little of ms. gregory's book in this script. the whole subplot of george boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated and in this version george is merely a flunky shuttling between his duty to the boleyn family and his duty to the king. i thought the title of the book referred to mary as the lesser-known of the boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to anne.second, the script has the characters periodically address the audience as if in confession. apparently this is intended to give a bit of back story and explain their motives, but it is amateurish in execution.on top of the bad script, the direction is stunningly bad. there are too many shots done with a circling camera which is none-too-steady at best and downright shaky at worst. several of the speeches are delivered tentatively, as if in a first rehearsal. the production values for henry's flamboyant court are minimal. the costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are from some costume designer's fevered imagination. and the king, the source of all power and favors, is often shown alone. no fawning courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all the people?? i am accustomed to hollywood turning history into fantasy, but i expected better from a bbc production. even based on a flawed book this production is bad.

i saw this movie on a show that was showing bad b-movies and trying to get you to buy them. it basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about. after viewing the trailer, i thought i would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. it's not entertaining in any sense of the word. the film has two (or should i say four) things going for it and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women. they are hot and naked a lot and ms. lovell could be a legit actress, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on t&a and corny dialogs. this isn't even a horror movie or scary, unless you are talking about watching the actors try to act. the production value is pathetic, the acting is worse and the writing is the worst. what was the point in making this movie? to scare people? to rip off "texas chainsaw massacre"? to try and be funny? to show off the women's breasts? to put some guy's head into a retarded outfit, with fake hands and legs? to have a character just say the word "snow" over and over? to not have any real violence but have enough nudity in an attempt to cover up the fact there is no real plot? to be able to make a sequel to a movie no one has seen or will ever watch? i made a mistake in picking up this movie, don't make this mistake too.stay away from this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i watched this film on the advice of a friend who assured me it was one of the funniest things he'd ever seen. sadly this person is completely lacking a sense of humour and i was forced to endure two hours of the worst film making i have ever seen. please do not watch this film. 1/10

i just watched this movie with a few friends they said i had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse. so i can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no "real" ghosts. i feel the worst part was this so called "old haunted house" contained a whole bunch of new items and a few "convieniently placed items" i could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being flipped over by an unseen ghost (or should i say wire). then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it flips in a different way. uh oh thats a big continuity error. if this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other "old house" items. this movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie. i would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting, effects and cheap video shots of the girls chests and how convenient the camera falls when something "paranormal" happens. this movie is an insult to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape.

this film is a good companion to blair witch, because it does so much wrong that bw did right. like bw, this one pretends to be a documentary of ghostly events, with each member of the team manning his/her own camera. the sense of reality is never there, however. the participants are poorly written clich√©d characters and the events that take place are equally clich√©d (the cat jumping out of a closet, falling chandelier, etc). also the stilted dialog and inept improv work by the overly-attractive cast detracts from the docu feel. and, worst of all, the supposedly participant-held cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely believable. actually, with some re-editing, this thing could have been a blair witch parody. in fact, there is a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge roach on it that is actually pretty funny as is, reminding me of a similar gross out scene from "austin powers: the spy who shagged me." but in the end the event is played straight, with no punchline. it's hard to tell what the intent was with the st francisville experiment other than to glom a few stray bw bucks. but it's pretty sad when the only real interest i could find in it was whether the blond historian was going to have her t-shirt tied up off her belly in a particular shot or not.

there is a lot of repetitive dialogue in this movie about "cold spots" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. to recreate the feeling of the movie, i shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. i'e seen worse movies than the st. francisville experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all ("it's getting cold!") basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. this is filmed as a supposedly true documentary. it's obviously not real, but the house does contain some cold spots. spoilers- (as if you won't be able to predict most of the plot!). not much happens in this film. we have the time-honored horror cliche of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning, as a "practice" scare to warm up the audience. the people wander around with flashlights, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace- that they mean no harm to the spirits (or cold spots) within. now and then a door will swing shut and startle somebody. of course , the ouija board makes an appearance. they chat with a ghost named "charles". a girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. more cold spots. another door swings shut and some guy goes off about the scuff sound of the door. scuff, scuff, he says. oh my god, somebody says. "surround yourself with white light." i admit there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is knocked over by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. but aside from some funny bad dialogue, the chair scene (the actual split-second when it is knocked over, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. however there are still some cold spots in here. eventually, the movie ends. nobody dies. no more details necessary. i wasn't a big fan of blair witch project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the st. francisville experiment. you may find yourself not debating whether or not this is a real documentary, but whether or not it was intended to be funny. i still don't know. but whatever it was intended to be, it failed.

obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the "blair witch" wave.this movie was set up like all the "reality" haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately (and i must admit, i get a kick out of these), but this movie is much cheesier! probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the "participants" going through the house, whining. give me a break! spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. any paranormal happenings are blatant setups. no strings, but too perfectly caught on camera to be real. the "participants" were not very likeable either. two goofy guys who don't take it seriously, one girl who scares at the drop of a hat, and the quintessential over-played "paranormal" person. is this becoming the clich√©d-"formula" for a ghost movie?i have to admit, the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension. they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes. i admit, i spent that time pacing in the kitchen. i really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger viewers, even if it is pg13.if you're looking for some entertainment, if you don't take it seriously, you will get a kick out of this movie. there's tons of situations to make cracks about! if you're looking for an great story-line.. look elsewhere ;)

imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in st. francisville, louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. if you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of blair witch project. what is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. it seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens. this movie is excellent for 'sleep overs', when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is yakin' and snackin'.

ted nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. i am looking for all his films to see. i could not find this one for 3 year, until i unexpectedly found it in youtube. to tell the truth i wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. it looks like in 1999-2001 ted had a crisis , maybe in money. his features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. but i do not claim him to be a bad director this time . everything happens. the ending has some nice creepy details and suspense but the whole film was long dull dialogues .only for real ted's fans.www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab

i rented this one by accident. i lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought "shameless blair witch rip-off". then, in a moment of carelessness, i grabbed 'the francisville experiment' thinking it was something else. my horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer. boring characters, bad acting, and a feeling of 'we saw the blair witch project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits. i'm not one to fault film makers for being lazy or desperate, but after this yawn-fest i felt the need to warn everyone: don't waste your time, you have a life.

the st. francisville experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of blair witch. where blair witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, the st. francisville experiement overworks the viewer's patience. one must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.warning: spoiler is forthcoming!!i viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" troy taylor spoke about the making of the movie. should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. for those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.mr. taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that the st. francisville experiment was not a documentary. shock! amazing! as if we didn't know... he informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in louisiana, but rather in california. all four participants were true actors (notice i didn't say good...). one of the participants is actually a special effects technician on er.what infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. it feebly attempts to outdo the blair witch project by claiming it's true whereas blair witch was a hoax. the amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "i love the ghosts", the st. francisville experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "i love the ghosts!"talk about false advertising. true stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood boy scouts troop set up a haunted house. from the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an oujia board to the two mice being found under a bed, the st. francisville experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. lion's gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:"the st. francisville experiment: a comedic look at how not to make a movie".

this is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. as a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr. huston should have been proud of making. however, the film is worth watching if you are a fan of "pre-code" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner is!! the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi. in the process, she meets a scalawag (bruce cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. however, miss dunne does not want him back, as she realizes he's not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. while all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time).surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. in this second phase of the film, miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. and, as a result of all this violence, miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer.but then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside. dunne meets a judge (walter huston) who is married but he desperately wants her. now throughout the film, dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot (she was more or less tricked into it). but now, single irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with his assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! but, while she's pregnant with his love child, he's indicted for being a crooked judge. he assures her he's innocent, but he's convicted and it sure sounds like he's a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. then, in the final moments of the film, miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released. the film then ends.so, we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like. i gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! this really undoes all the positives about dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. a strong women's rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! with a decent re-write, this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film, but it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre-code film.

some famous stories are prone to being moved to another epoch and, as such, becoming an embarrassing tv-movie. oscar wilde's canterville ghost is one of them. this tv movie for kids is utterly cheap, concerning acting, character work, credibility, directing and even concerning the modest special effects. as often, the question arises: what was this made for?

i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so unbelievably awful i could not switch it off. every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the oscar wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. it barely matters because the dire acting, clich√©d camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. the worst performance comes from patrick stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. "get thee out of here!" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain. a truly terrible film and why wonders why stewart, who can act when called upon to do so, has soiled his reputation by making worthless pieces of crap like this and the xmen.

i was really excited when i read "the canterville ghost" would be shown on tv. however, i was deeply disappointed. i loved the original story written by oscar wilde and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie.

there's a certain irony in a parody of the gothic genre being turned into a mess of clich√©s by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was, or just didn't care. all of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. the movie has very little in common with wilde's original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time. if wilde saw this version, he'd probably laugh- and then of course, write a parody. one can only hope that the children who watched this bland, mass-produced pap eventually discovered the wit and sparkle of the original version.

wow... i suspected this one to be bad... but now i find myself just at a loss for words... honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...i'll try to say something anyway...this truly is one unique gem. one of the worst kind.lash la rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? a true stroke of genius, without a doubt.it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone. it happened numerous times with this one.the accents of the actors, man, the accents... and the dialogues i heard them speak... and the acting itself... i just couldn't believe what i was hearing.that fat uncle farting so loudly (when walking up to the house together with his little nephew) for no apparent reason whatsoever...tits! yes, there's titties! and female ass! there's even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beer...that one "stretch his mouth over his face"-kill was the bomb! a true highlight.the comedy-aspects were just totally bonkers. i just couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing. for a while i even thought that they were unintentional, shaking my head in disbelief. but about halfway in the movie, i started to get the bigger picture. guess it took me half a movie to dumb-down half of my brain, to finally get it.i had a really hard time believing this movie... but it's good, really, i think. it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard, opening it and then saying "wooow, look at all the storage space!". and she said it like she meant it. i mean, that's good dialogue and good acting, right?oh, and perhaps needless to say: lash la rue's whip-skills suck major ass in the dark power. it's really sad and pathetic to behold. that's all part of the comedy, of course. or wait, i might be wrong. no, yes, i'm wrong. lash la rue was amazing with the whip! it was the editor's fault. he messed it up, cutting his lashes together and all. or wait, it might have been the camera operator. he filmed from the wrong angles... then why didn't phil smoot say anything? that's it, it's the director's fault.but it's a good movie.i'm just gonna quit talking about it. i have nothing meaningful to say anyway, except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience... some time soon.

ladies and gentlemen, allow us to introduce to you ¬Ö. the toltecs! this ancient latin american tribe, even preceding the aztecs, supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers, yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip! but before you get to see this, however, you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any actual sleaze. in case i haven't made myself entirely clear yet: "the dark power" is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. writer/director phil smoot's intentions were obviously admirable, but he ¬ñ as well as the rest of the cast & crew ¬ñ lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent. smoot carefully watched "the evil dead" and other similar demonic-themed movies, and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well. the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house; barely speaking out his last word above a whisper ¬Ö toltecs. his grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks, including a typically 80's aerobics babe, a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal. soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a hermit, as he was actually the guardian of an ancient toltec burial ground. toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. and, honestly, is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos? as hinted at before already, the first half of "the dark power" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. the clich√©d pranks, the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of lash larue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. then, the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. instead of menacing, they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning, when a guy's lips are stretched out over his entire skull, but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless, like when a 9-year-old kid (named cletus!) goes joyriding with his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out. seriously, unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing, i'd advise to skip this film.

wow, what a cheesy movie this is! it starts off looking like it's gonna be a backwoods slasher, with the camera following dogs running through the woods. it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits. we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath. it suddenly gets really cheesy when the "zombie indians" arise from the earth and start terrorising the girls. we even get a samurai indian. this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting. once the indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them for they aren't technically zombies) start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins. this is not a special flick and can't be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends. i can't help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring.

of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst. i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it.the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it.if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time, it is bad.they are making a sequel, so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie, but i don't think it is possible.

i couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a total drag. childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "legally blonde" look like "the usual suspects" and so many coincidences that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. ok, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. well if i were 12, i'd feel insulted. the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla gugino that just stole every scene she was in. sadly, there weren't many. 4/10

all the actors in this film seem bored. they are not really interested in their roles and the dialogue is all delivered in monotone. it's a problem because i think the basic idea for the film is really very sound. i suppose it's just bad direction which leaves the actors drifting.

as kids movie it is great. for the family it just sucks. i was truly hoping for something like the goonies which is a great film for all ages. this movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? alan cummings was however a delight. and why do people compare willy wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the willy wonka song doesnt make this film anything like willy wonka.

my kids enjoyed the movie, but i was bored. there were a few good lines and a handful of funny parts, but the plot was pretty lame and relied on the special effects and gadgets to pull it through. still, it hit the center of the bullseye that it was aiming for: it was good for the kids.

this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie. the most upsetting one was danny trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned.

i am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much i detested this movie. the historical trial of henriette deluzy-desportes and the duc de praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, i feel, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film, the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters. the worst of them were the duc's children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch.in conclusion, this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed.

what an awful movie. full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. it is hard to believe the same guys that wrote the people vs. larry flint and man on the moon wrote this garbage. man, this makes my list of top 10 worst movies of all-time. didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first problem child was bad enough? let alone make a sequel for it!!?? amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released! 1 out of 10 *'s

whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's "cool" to hate, like "manos, the hands of fate" or "the avengers") i ask them, "is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? does anyone utter the line 'i'd rather eat a turd' in that movie?"this movie is way too infantile and moronic for adults, and way too violent and irresponsible for children. is there that much money in the beavis and butt-head demographic to make a series of movies like this? there is a problem child 3, but i haven't seen it. i'd rather eat a turd.

did the first travesty actually make money? this is another sequel (along the lines of another stakeout) that no one asked for. but we've received it anyway. the sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. it's also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) to think i almost felt sorry for ritter, yasbeck, and warden. did they need the money that much?

"problem child" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? i don't think it did. the original movie's only redeeming asset was gilbert gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.i can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. for starters, it just wasn't funny. even when i saw this as a nine-year-old, i didn't sympathize with junior (michael oliver) at all. his character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben (john ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. it also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the u.s. these days) when the one woman ben decides to (almost) marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is.and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate laraine newman come back to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. i also found it strange that she was a white southern d√©butante whose name was lawanda. that sounds more like an african-american woman's name. but of course, that has nothing to do with why i disliked this movie.i think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. john ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. instead, he came off not only as a wimpy parent, but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, regardless of how well he knew the woman. did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents?in a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character, that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior, completely uncalled for toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). the movie was just a mess, and really doesn't deserve a dvd release if it hasn't been given one already. it should just rot on vhs along with all the other bad, forgettable 90's comedies.

junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. it's the same life because junior hasn't changed one bit. he is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. this time he has a pal named trixie and she is only slightly worse. junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. i thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end. this is a movie for the most immature people. it has diapers, farts, doggy do do, and toilet humor in it. only someone under the age of twelve would find this to be super hilarious. i hope when i have a son, he is exactly like junior.

ten minutes of people spewing gallons of pink vomit. recurring scenes of enormous piles of dog excrement - need one say more???

the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter. aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. in this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated ben (ritter) and his little hellraiser junior (michael oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. ben eventually picks lawanda (played by the most underused original snl-er laraine newman), whose blanche dubois tendencies don't suit junior in the least. to add on to junior's torture, it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet, single mother played by yasbeck, the same actress who played junior's first horrible mother-through-adoption. you can see where the plot goes from here. searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so i guess i'll go with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" gag that makes back to the future's james tolkan one of the many grown-up victims (that guy's always playing school authority figures). jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film, but sadly, there is no appearance from the bow-tie klansma- er, i mean killer (michael richards) that made problem child all the more fun. on a serious note, i'm sure these films, whether abusive parents saw them or no, did wonders for the red-headed children of america. let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption. oh, and dog poop jokes - gotta have dog poop jokes.... shmucks.

the reason why i gave this movie a 4 was for a couple reasons, but this movie was not that bad. first off, the editing i found too be pretty poor at times, the script(or what they had of one) was not very good, and if not for nunzio la bianca, the acting would have been crap. but all that aside(ha ha i know its like the whole movie) its not that bad for an extremely low ind. , low budget film. if they would have gotten more money, a little better actors(but these ones were intimidating so it was good) and a little more detailed script this movie would be terrific. somebody has to tell me this guy was influenced a lot by the warriors by walter hill. i mean this movie is exactly like it. anyone who has seen both those films will agree with me.

this film could have been great- but wasn't. amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. the main star of the film plays a good lead role. he is convincing and has those scary italian eyes. however, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. the opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. it looks like gay porno. fortunately no one stripped off. the rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish. the prison sequence was the best part of the film- although irrelevant. the movies soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using cooledit and some sample cds. it is boring, repetitive and extremely lame. in fact the whole film is lame. get out while you still can!

i'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. this should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. however, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. it goes from bad to worse. talk about low budget, one torture scene consists of a guy getting a mug of coffee thrown over him while he's tied to a chair. evidently this is very painful because the big baby proceeds to scream in agony....maybe he ordered decaf!! the acting is worse than wooden (i could possibly watch a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored, if you can look at this rubbish for that long you're a better man than i!) and the fight scenes would be at home on a kindergarten play yard. do not touch this movie, unless you enjoy pain (in which case you should try spilling lukewarm coffee over yourself). i'd like to say it's so bad it's good, but really this is just awful.

this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors, only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about.the story in general is not that bad, based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gang's girl. they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs. on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re-written it, but as mentioned above - with not nearly as much intensity.the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting... the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down.this film has nothing on once were warriors.low budget, alright story, poor acting, nothing to write home about.

this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time - in australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. aussie park boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia (an irish gang in twenty-first century sydney! the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!) but because it's about ethnic rivalry, one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema (along with struggling families, minority groups, and the biography of a famous australian) it won multiple academy awards. i've always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. this film proves otherwise. so to all you australian aspiring film-makers out there, don't bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act, or even getting your facts right - just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet, or someone of a foreign race coming to australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book, some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isn't actually plausible in the period the film is set, and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is!

within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know. the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep, i will give the person one 10/10 and that was for the dvd cover because if i actually saw "before watching this" in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it, why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards. now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i wouldn't ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is "wow if this was the best i wouldn't want to know what the crap in the film festival was like"films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films, because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good, but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes, and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there

everything about this movie is awful.you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. you can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.we start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.what then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. the first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups. the wogs always win of course, because they apparently lift weights and have "respect". it is in these scenes that we first get to see the degree of bad acting, editing, scripting and hatred for the people who funded this film.eventually the main character and his mate get sent to prison. the entire prison part of the movie is unrelated to what i assume is the plot, and consists of a bunch of fights.once out of prison(3 years for murder?) the main character and his mate reunite with the wogs. they then go to the "other side of town" and try to lay low, because apparently everyone wants to kill them.soon the wogs get set up for the rape of another gang members girl , and run around town fighting off hordes of different gangs. this point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, as the wogs simply run around and fight off enemies who seemingly get worse and worse as the movie goes on.anyway the movie ends with some massive climatic fight scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) take on every gang they've fought so far. apparently the other gangs don't have a problem uniting to take on the remaining wogs(the skinheads don't mind asians). after about a million more people get beaten up by the invincible wog brothers the movie ends with the main characters heading home. they don't make it home however, because they are burned to death by the the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere.this movie may be more like a computer game then a movie, because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches to the face from a million different people who the majority of the time are twice their size.there are also tonnes more stupid unexplainable events in this movie, such as an asian fighting off his own gang and taking a katana to the head just to let the wogs get away.like someone else mentioned, this movie isn't so bad its funny, it's just so bad.

i, like many folks, believe the 1989 epic lonesome dove was one of the best westerns ever produced, maybe the best. and, realizing that most sequels (in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. comanche moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting, poor casting and frankly, a lousy script. lonesome dove created western heroes of captains mccrae and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones. prior to living in lonesome dove, we believed they bravely fought to rid texas of bandits and savage indians during their rangering years. if i had only seen comanche moon, i would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. in lonesome dove, call and mccrae supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him. in comanche moon, a shot to call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. there wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries. the best punch was mccrea sucker punching inez scull, a funny scene but out of character for mccrae.where was mccrae's wit and charm? clara's love for mccrae, a drunken, unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. and maggie's love for call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic. the cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. credit goes not only to hd technology, but the cinematographer. the comanche moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights, but sadly that's not saying much.

oh dear, oh dear! what were they thinking of? terrible script, terrible acting. i don't even feel sorry for the actors... they took their cheques to the bank and smiled happily.since when did an air shaft from charing cross pop out at bank? why are vehicles crossing tower bridge going in towards the city when the surge hit? why is tower bridge not crowded when the city is being evacuated? how does carlyle dive into a raging torrent.... and survive? i could go on... and on.there is no real sense of urgency in the command room. they might just as well be waiting for the england eleven to come back onto the pitch after the tea interval at lords.it says something when i await the adsbreaks to learn more about diarrahoea treatment with eager anticipation.totally abominable trash!

it was inferred by a previous poster that the military would not be subordinate to the police in a disaster as depicted in the film. in fact the military role would be to supply aid to the civil authorities when requested to do so. the civil authorities would retain primacy. in practise the army would need 48 hours or so to mobilise themselves, there not being much army presence in london, especially with current overseas commitments. even then they would be dependent on calling in the ta.as for cobra, we were given the impression that it was a full governmental emergency department in its own right - even reference to a met police cobra division. in fact cobra stands for cabinet office briefing room "a". it's just the room where the pm or dpm meet their advisers to discuss the current emergency!

this film was just on two nights running on itv1.. dear oh dear. someone actually bought this on the strength of robert carlylse.. ok, i missed the start.. but what i did see was so bad i thought, no... i watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it. nothing was based on reality, i doubt things would progress as they did in this film. everything was poor about this film. ok, cgi.. but no reality. the write up gave the impression of a cliff hanger end..sorry, i wasn't impressed. yes, formulaic. couldn't guess the end. from what i saw the military had the upper hand, people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing, it just wouldn't have happened that way? it was worse than leave your brain at the door. it was annoying.. as someone else said.. yeah, right.. of course that would have happened... not!! the credits mentioned quebec and canada.. so it was a co production, missed the third party concerned.. i'll have to check back on this site. i'm not usually this critical, but this annoyed me.

in addition to all the negative reviews: i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere, somehow a cctv-camera was summoned at a most unlikely location, to show the 'crisis'-team (''look maaaaa-aaam'') what was going on, notably near the thames-barrier, where the professor is hit at full (wind)force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story. otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films/programs: i said to my wife: 'hey, that's neil, from the young ones' (nigel planer) and 'did they summon hercule poirot for help?' (david suchet). to add to the disgrace of this film (shown in two parts on itv uk recently), itv showed the telephone number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers, living in areas 'at risk of flooding'. how low can you as a broadcaster go to treat your audience like that? what must the environment agency have thought?? (''oh no, it's mrs jones from hull again. she says she was right all along, she saw it on itv'').

i'll put it straight to you, this movie is dead boring. it's about a flood, that's it. blah blah a little about family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah blah boring. blame it all on the weatherman, poor sod. the deputy prime minister campbell is a hard-ass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a most irritating character. if you are from the united kingdom, or anywhere that it may flood, then you might like this film. it's sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen. this is not really an action film, where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer, or outrun it literally, it is more like a time-bomb that must be disabled. looking at this movie, it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is overpopulated, it isn't, but for them it is. really, the movie is about as exciting as picking scabs and i can't recommend it. it's over 100 minutes, far far too long.the problems with the film; i won't get into them beyond this because the film doesn't deserve such dissection. hint to you londoner's - buy more boats. if you bring children to this movie they'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons.

the first time i had heard of guest house paridiso was in the, er... "washroom" after having just seen fight club. in each urinal was deposited a small, round black circle. when the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it caused a colour picture to form, with photographs of the two stars and the tag line "you'll p*** yourself laughing". when you'd finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again, waiting to spring it's surprise on the next "victim".okay, maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. in fact, i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, that's a real feat. what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise.i hate to pan guest house paridiso and i am indebted to rik mayall (richard twat) and adrian edmondson (eddie elizabeth ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, be it the invention of the young ones (1982-1984), the sitting room plays of bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, such as rik in the new statesman (1988-1993). in fact, this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special. unfortunately, its an 89 minute film.there's definitely some merit to be had, and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale, which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark, and involved... well, you'll have to see that bit for yourself. yet often the pace is leaden, and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. the two stars (edmondson taking his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he adequately directs) never really get into first gear, mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. indeed, the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. the slight hints of depth seen in the series (richie's effeminate, failed social-climbing for example) are not present here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.the fawlty towers accusation does pass water, complete with drunken chef and unseen, called-for waiter "pasquele", which uncannily rhymes with manuel. some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there, and all the "dead laugh" areas patched up with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago.paridiso's brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humour is funny, and i feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.

i loved all the other don knotts movies, but i never heard much about "how to frame a fig" and now i know why: i can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. this movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them would give this a thumbs down. at best there are brief moments of mild amusement, mostly from don knotts playing the same nervous, underdog persona that made him famous.after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw. we were in complete agreement: the prentiss gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don knotts character.be happy that mr. limpet, reluctant astronaut, shakiest gun and mr. chicken movies are around to enjoy.

doesn't anyone bother to check where this kind of sludge comes from before blathering on about its supposed revelations? ask yourself a question: is my skull an open bucket that i allow anyone to dump their propaganda into? do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb-shelter mentality of pathtofreedom.com before you waste your time with this screed.these sorts of mother earth/people's republic of berkeley urbanite fruitcakes that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn't match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity. else why resort to willful distortion and blatant one-sidedness? pathetic.don't be a sap. take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more 'end of the world' hysteria from it-takes-a-village types with a political agenda that's probably even to the left of your own. mi. moore (rather his unthinking followers) have really opened the floodgates with this kind of one-sided political trash passed off as a *cough* documentary. but apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever-gullible public: "if it's on a movie screen, it must be true." god gave you a brain - act like you know what you're supposed to do with it...

a modern scare film? yep it is..the hippies, peaceniks and environmentalists got together to deliver us a fear film.. i didn't recognize it when watching it only 2 years ago that it was a fear film but that's exactly what it is..there's no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww2 and the same films we made about them.. this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those.. that believe in aliens, 9/11 conspiracy plots, faked moon landings, peak oil and major environmentalism what i can say is this film does push buttons, make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it.. it's a scare film.. so if your scarred get in your houses, lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush provokes the chinese into nuclear war..

the topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban sprawl, public transportation, oil & gas depletion, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc.the problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece. one viewpoint is presented, then hammered upon the viewer over and over. you see the same handful of 'experts' repeatedly making their case. the supposed 'narrator' starts off sounding like a news reporter, but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma.the dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion, but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post-oil society and all that it entails. they paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self-contained local village model; walk to work, shop locally, grow our own food, and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. for them, the post-oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world. it would certainly spell the end of globalization, and better still, the end of walmart. i will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over-touted alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen.i gave it 3 stars because i appreciated the old footage and the premise.

i rate movies on this site all the time, but i don't normally write comments. however, in this case, i felt compelled to warn others! this movie is bad! it's probably one of only a dozen movies i have scored as '1 (awful).' i know people say this all the time, but this truly was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it's easily on the bottom ten, anyway.when it comes to horror movies, i have very low standards. i'll overlook all sorts of shoddy film-making for a good scare. but this movie is embarrassingly bad. it looks someone bought a video camera at sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies. (the fact that every single crew member's name appears in the cast list proves this theory, i think.) this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play. it's actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on dvd. the special effects are somewhat effective at times, but are still amateurish at best. the best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera, most of the time. i can't say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along. any and all attempts at humor are lame. this movie is such a colossal waste of time.

did you ever think, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "wow, this is so cool! we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon. i bet it isn't as difficult as it seems"? well, this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003, presumably right after watching sam raimi's "the evil dead" or a similar independent horror classic. this "demon summer", however, is so bad it's embarrassing! these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics, but that nearly doesn't make them talented. i've seen quite a lot lousy b-movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. and it's quite sad to be this open-hearted, because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions. there's pretty much no script at all. a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and, whilst reading some passages of it, one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager-groups: dorks, hot catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. that's about it, except of course for all the obligatory clich√©s, like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc... the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! they just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. i hate that! some of make-up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk-songs ever. this film should never have been released... i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production, but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element. not even a bit of amateur-nudity, damned!

i understand that the budget was low on this film, but come on this is really terrible film-making. the script is just plain awful and that was the free part. the effects aren't bad, but this film plays out like a conventional r-rated movie with lame scares and cut-away violence rather than a no holds barred unrated gore-fest that was intentionally made for video. who were these guys kidding? like this would have been released in theaters.the acting is terrible. the editing, another free aspect of the film, is beyond amateur, and the plot, as i said before, leaves little to be desired. there's nothing original about the film. gore fans, avoid this one. to the filmmakers: try for something original next time, or stop making movies all together. you're not good at it. people hate a trashy rehash, especially one of such low caliber. avoid! it isn't even worth making fun of.

i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. it has set the standard. i will never again give a movie a 1, unless it was as horrible as this one. i fully agree with the other comments about this film. but, since i'm dutch, i watched it with dutch translation. apparently, they didn't have money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. with sometimes hilarious results.don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs, don't watch demon summer.i was surprised that the actors (wow, i can't believe i just said that.) didn't hold the script (was there any?) in their hands while shooting. i think they also did a good job on... well... uhmm... no, they didn't do a good job at all.

a few bratty kids unwittingly unleash an evil that has lain dormant for the past twenty years and have to reap the ill fortune that comes with that.the campbell brothers' film before this "midnight skater" was fun & their picture after "the red skulls" was all right. so why is "demon summer" so mind-numbingly bad? i really don't know, it is better then their "splatter rampage wrestling" but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringe-worthy and when a 'horror' film is as talky as this one is, that's not a good thing. the story's been done to death in many other better films, so why waste your time on this one? my grade: d-

linda arvidson (as jennie) and harry solter (as frank) are enjoying a romantic tryst, when in walks her father charles inslee; furious, he chases mr. solter out of the house. undaunted, he goes to her balcony and begs her to elope. ms. arvidson is agreeable, and goes to pack. then, burglar george gebhardt arrives to rob the place. though he doesn't get much in the way of booty, thieving gebhardt manages to use arvidson's trunk to escape from the police¬Ö a contrived comedy. note, during the balcony scene, solter goes off-camera, so burglar gebhardt can enter the house undetected. and, arvidson travels very light, since there appears to be nothing in her heavy trunk; perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau solter? director d.w. griffith, robert harron, and florence lawrence are illustrious extras. ** a calamitous elopement (8/7/08) d.w. griffith ~ george gebhardt, linda arvidson, harry solter

andr√© roussin was a specialist of what the french call "theatre de boulevard" : plays where you find the eternal triangle:man/wife/(male or female)lover .many of his plays gave elvire popesco some of her best parts on stage....and the great actress was the main reason to watch them,for roussin is not sacha guitry ,by a long shot.the french audience remembers "au theatre ce soir' .still with me? roussin's plays were not made to be filmed.and this one is pretty mediocre material ,even if the screenwriters call lewis carroll to their rescue .i like stewart granger and david niven ,and ava gardner is eye candy .but this might be their worst film ,being crude, predictable -even the native's (bola -bola )intervention is ludicrous- a knockabout farce around a menage √† trois on a desert island where granger would be some kind of robinson,niven ,his friday and gardner his girl friday.

this is probably my least favorite episode. i lived in cape girardeau for quite some time. i can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boats, fresh crab or scallops anywhere near missouri. cape girardeau is the only inland cape, it's on the mississippi river. it looked like the license plates were from mississippi, which may explain why there was so much racial tension. missouri and mississippi are 2 completely different states that don't touch one another. there are many roads in and out of town and none of them are route 6 or route 666. this whole inaccuracy was very distracting. also, cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around dean if she was well educated. i did not buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the lengthy love scene. jo was more dean's style.

tommy lee jones was the best woodroe and no one can play woodroe f. call better than he. not only was he the first and best, he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion. it was a bad let-down and i'm surprised i even made myself watch it. i can even begin how how pitiful they made woodroe. i understand he would be old by that time, but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down. the first movie was the best and the only one that i'll ever watch. i hope to god that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without tommy or duval. without them, the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone, including the director. if you plan on making another lonesome dove movie of any kind, take mine and billions of others, don't waste time. continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground. thanks.

i should have known better..the clues were all over imdb.com. this flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record. the cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of joe estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies. etc. suffice it to say, i can't see any reason why anyone would want to see this awful, amateurish attempt at film making. turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies. nuff said.

this was an 1970s-type irreverent comedy, poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills. i didn't mind that but i did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion: two topics which secular filmmakers (meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere) just can't stop trashing. walter matthau plays a scuzzy character, "donald becker," who walks around with a cleric's collar on, which offends me but when has hollywood ever been worried about offending christians?anyway, despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it. dan aykroyd is good at paying a nut-case and donna dixon ("laura rollins") is a knockout. i am sorry she didn't have a bigger role.

this has to be one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune to see. the general idea of a coronal mass ejection hitting the planet earth with em disruption is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155¬∫f? the acting was so terrible i got the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people off of santa monica boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. in all honesty i have seen less wooden acting from my ironing board. sorry, but this film was poor, poor, poor.

absolutely horrible movie. not a bad plot concept, but executed horribly. clich√© storyline; bad script. so schlocky it doesn't even qualify for campy. this is the kind of movie that gives sci-fi a bad name.

inferno starts off with a fairly impressive for a tvm starscape effect . we`re also introduced to a scientist who`s called heller . don`t you get it ? heller , hell-er , inferno . so i guess someone on the production had some intelligence . however it does become more and more obvious as the tvm progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an american tvm audience the story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring umpteen stock tvm characters like the tough liberal schoolteacher who`s trying to save a home boy from a life of crime , the doctor who`s lost his medical licence etc . in fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a puff of smoke , and being a tvm we just know that there won`t be a downbeat ending there is an onscreen problem i noticed and that is everytime there`s an explosion there`s a massive fireball which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible . look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang . a soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball . what a small greanade containing no more than a few ounces of high explosive can do that ! no it can`t . there`s also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect is seen . can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as napalm having said that i did find inferno highly watchable for a tvm and at no time did i find myself wanting to turn it off . it did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and it`s not as bad a tvm as some people are making out

mario racocevic from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk.i had to go through "midnight video" who have a swedish branch.i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only skr30 a title.this film goes under many "a.k.a's" depending on when and where it is marketed.i had previously purchased "the bloodsucker leads the dance" (which you will find if you search on imdb under "people" and input "krista nell").the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.i smiled when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious krista nell.there are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion, sleazy affairs with girlfriends' mothers, a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit, a gangrape by a "client's" motorcycle friends, sleazy photography, cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - sleaze, (but artistic sleaze).the aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their "wheres and whyfores".personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long, having made their point, so that the film appeared to drag in places; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.krista nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and i was left wanting more from her, the director and the screenplay.i love the political incorrectness shown in older films (this is 30 years from its making) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office!i would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such.

if you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is - dont.for me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most british (& irish)films are. forgettable tripe is the best i can say. if it had been on telly l would have wandered off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. i saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes. but, oh dear.....as a comedy it wasn't funny, as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. as a love story totally unbelievable. most of all as a piece of 'gloriously over the top whimsy' it lacked both style and charm. gambon and caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er..... gambon and caine. is it just me, but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the lads, does michael caine leave you cold?in fairness, some of my friends thought it was 'ok' but if you do go, my advice is have a few drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked up at home.

michael caine usually appears in either very good ("blame it on rio", "sleuth", "without a clue", "gambit", "dirty rotten scoundrels") or truly bad comedies ("noises off", "death becomes her", "harry & walter go to ny"). this falls into the latter category.ta is a comedy that succeeds in only two things: managing to waste a cast that includes caine, gambon and richardson, all of which have comedic abilities, and succeeding in its mission not to make the viewer laugh. there isn't a single truly funny moment here. the main reason is the lousy script; there was so much futile effort put into writing a pointlessly convoluted story which is simply too bothersome to follow (considering it's only a comedy) that the writer(s) forgot to make the damn thing funny, which, as far as i can recall, is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be.i've never seen this moron before. some people even say "if you're a moron fan you'll love this" bla bla bla. a moron fan? does this non-descript person really have fans? a comedy as badly written as this requires a mega-talent to eke out a laugh or two out of it, someone like steve coogan and not your average moron.if you're going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are. the characters of caine and moron are insufficiently dumb.the single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl. only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it's wise to include a super-intelligent wise-ass kid. smart-a** kids aren't even funny to bill cosby fans any more. in "little miss sunshine" we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny. this stupid ol' the-kid-is-smarter-than-the-adults shtick belongs to a century-old marx brothers film.

we saw this in a bargain basket at the local asda: ¬£1.50 for the dvd. reading all the hype plastered all over the cover saying how "hillarious" it is, and it also had a really good, established cast, we thought this must a great film.so we bought, took it home, shoved it in the dvd player, sat back and waited for the funnies to begin.......and waited.......and waited.....and waited a bit more.some 90 minutes later, although it felt more like 3 hours, the credits rolled, and that was the end of that.what a letdown - even paying ¬£1.50 seemed a con. god knows what caine, richardson and gambon were thinking when they said 'yes' to this tosh. and as for moran: well much as i enjoyed black books, shaun of the dead, and his comedy tours, i felt he was out of his depth in this film. he tried too hard playing for laughs, probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his black books character, would work here.sadly it back-fired. the gags fell flat after awhile, and then he became just an irritation. which is a shame because i believe given the right part he could be a very good film/character actor.anyway, to sum up: the actors in the actors, failed to act!!! **/*****

it is hard to imagine two actors of such class and experience as michael caine and michael gambon getting involved in such an embarrassingly inept film. the responsibility for this ill-judged production has to be down to the writer, neil jordan and director, conor mcpherson. i doubt i've seen such a bad film with such good credits in a long time. the comedian, dylan moran, who made his mark as the irritable and incompetent bookshop owner in the tv sitcom, blackbooks, turns in much the same routine here, except with such excess and lack of comedic control as to leave one squirming. it is easy to see how the story could have been made to work, for the situation is an interesting one and loaded with comic potential. a classical actor (caine) tries to rip off the mob (gambon and co) with the aide of a bumbling wannabe colleague (moran), with predictable results. it could have and should have been good. sadly, it was not to be.

the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair. presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape. one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent, the conversation went along the lines of: 'do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan? michael caine and michael gambon are already in!' this is a dull 'comedy' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well-planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael gambon. the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly. moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books. caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched. one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it can't even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background. gambon actually steals the show, and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man. but overall the result is disappointing, and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa.

in following dylan moran's star from the charming misanthrope bookstore owner in the surrealist sitcom black books, i could see his comic potential begging to be utilised in theater or larger cinematic avenues. this first big screen outing in a starring role (he had a cameo as rufus the thief in notting hill) had oodles of promise, but like the strained steve coogan vehicle, the parole officer, has too many creases which should have been ironed out in preproduction.the plot is so convoluted that i shan't bother repeating the finer details (the script has every character do that for us), and the laughs are sourced from show business in-jokes. michael caine is a pompous has-been running a production of richard iii - updated to nazi occupation (one of the few genuine laughs, a satirical jab at ian mckellen), in which everyone is forever doing the hitler salute every time they take the stage. convincing dylan that acting should be a conceptual act unto itself, the two plot to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters by way of their acting prowess. confusion ensues (both on screen and in the audience), there's a romantic sub-plot between dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and dylan gets to dress in odd clothes and do funny accents. michael caine delivers some choice lines, and dylan's comic timing is on the money, so why isn't it any good? it does have a certain charm that you would expect from film 4, but it also has a precocious little girl acting as compass in a muddled and irrelevant plot - a no-no in screen writing 101. exposition overshadows everything else. you just want to see moran and caine acting as comic foil to each other the way the were at the beginning, but when they're together toward the end, the the pairing has lost its charisma.the actors is an amusing, albeit underwhelming effort. should it come on telly during a rainy tuesday afternoon, then have at you. otherwise you would be better off watching your old black books videos, or renting withnail & i.

when i say worse, i mean less entertaining. todd sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last zombie bloodbath, which makes the movie even less tolerable. in the last movie there were no special camera effects, where in this one, we are treated to shaky cam, and constant switching to black and white. also, this is called zombie bloodbath, despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one. the movie starts in 1945, where some satanists kill a violent burglar and put him up as a scarecrow. back in modern time, some kids have a car problem and go to a house, the same house in which the satanist murder happened. some mean people try to rape the kids (or something), and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life, who comes back with some zombies and now talks like darth vader. mr. sheets amped up the language and lessened the violence. if you want to see what a bad movie is, check this out! my rating: bomb/****. 96 mins. not rated, contains violence and language.

jerry angell, owner of zombie-horror's finest mullet, returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd sheets' atrocious home-made gore-fest zombie bloodbath. this time around, jerry plays a sleazy low-life thug who, along with his equally despicable partner-in-crime, some escaped convicts, several teenagers, and a bunch of screaming girls, comes face-to-face with a horde of shambling, flesh-eating corpses.obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath, sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the original¬óa feat that i thought was almost impossible to achieve. the acting is uniformly lousy, the effects amateurish and cheap (most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offcuts, offal and blood from the local butcher's shop), the story incomprehensible (as far as i could fathom, the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to!!!), and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black-and-white.and as if that wasn't enough to convince you of this film's complete lack of redeeming features, the simply mind-bogglingly moronic ending should do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesh-eating bacteria laying on its passenger seat¬ójust the thing for dissolving the undead (but, strangely enough, not at all detrimental to the living).

a group of teens have their car break down in the middle of nowhere. they seek shelter in a farmhouse. but three murderous convicts are there killing the owner of said farmhouse and his family. one of them accidentally brings zombies around by knocking over a scarecrow. cue blood, gore, carnage, bad acting. better than the first but only by default. i still wouldn't wish it on my arch-enemy, bob. in the end the filmmaker wants it to be a parable about how we us americans are killing ourself and our forests (huh? ok, whatever buddy) dude i'd rather chop down forests then have my braincells diminish and my grey matter leak out of my ears. in other words become a simple-minded idiot liberal.my grade: d-

wow! this movie is almost too bad for words. obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the ghoulies franchise, so they got pete liapis from the first one to reprise his role as jonathan...only now, he's a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one. the ghoulies in this one aren't the ghoulies from the last ones. the cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking costumed little people. instead of being any main antagonist or being evil, they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reason.when watching this film for the first time, it felt like i'd seen it before. why was this? because everything in this was stolen from another movie. all the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from lethal weapon. the ghoulies were pretty much like bugs bunny and daffy duck, except they weren't amusing at all. even scenes from the original ghoulies film were sprinkled throughout this flick.i think the target audience was supposed to be adults, but the mixture of black magic, cartoon slapstick, cop drama and bad acting doesn't work at all. i hope they don't make a ghoulies v, because i don't want a movie studio to lose their money.my rating: bomb/****. 78 mins. r for violence.

they do... each sequel is worst. you, who think that ghoulies 2 or 3 need a 1, please, watch this sequel... you'll be wondering with the first three parts. then you'll give a 10 to the first, 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other. that's because ghoulies 4 really gets the big 1 (from me it does).

this movie was so horrible...i want to beat the hell out of who ever made this movie...i was a original fan of all the ghoulies movies...but when i seen this i just began to cry i could not handle it..there are not even ne ghoulies in it...like the original creative monsters...this is so friggen cheap...i meen come on a witch...thats bull crap no one wants to see the witch...they wanted to see what the movie is about..."ghoulies" i meen jeesh am i right or what? thats y we watched the other ones..now we have to actually put up with this horrible storyline...this makes me want to eat my own poop after spaghetti monday!!!

ghoulies iv starts in a museum storage facility where pvc & leather clad blonde alexandra (stacie randall) is looking for a ancient jewel, after offing various guards she summon the demon faust who she worships & wants to have sex with, unfortunately she lost the jewel so he's not very happy & orders her to get the last remaining one... which belongs to jonathan graves (returning from the original ghoulies (1985) peter liapis) who is experienced in demonic possession & stuff like that after the events of the original ghoulies. alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring faust to earth permanently from the 'other side' to, well i don't know actually. erm, that's about it really...directed by jim wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when it's attached to a film i'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on goulies iv is as i expected complete, total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. the ,ahem, 'script' , cough, by mark sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other ghoulies film except in it's title & that they managed to convince liapis to reprise his role which also has the added bonus of big able to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever. the story is almost none existent, the whole film is a real chore to watch, it's incredibly boring & moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's squeaky clean as far as blood or gore goes & it has two comic relief goblins whom i assume are supposed to fill the ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films & are in fact just embarrassing to watch, in fact i think they were practising to be ventriloquist's during most of the film as when they speak their mouth's don't move... you know i don't want to talk or think about ghoulies iv anymore so please believe me when i say this is one huge piece of crap of elephant sized proportions, don't waste either your time or money.dirctor wynorski turns in a throughly rotten film on just about every level, the special effects are terrible as is the whole film. apparently ghoulies iv is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile & it is neither funny nor scary. the best thing about this film is actress randall in her pvc & leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel & that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see. there's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film & given wynorski's track record i'm sure it was. forget about any gore as there isn't any.technically ghoulies iv sucks, it's obvious it had & low budget but that simply isn't an excuse for it to be this bad, is it? liapis is back in the cast although he probably wishes he'd stayed away, pvc clad babe randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot.ghoulies iv is crap, there's nothing else to say really. i honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this, i just can't. i can't believe that i'm going to recommend the original ghoulies over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than ghoulies iv, one to avoid folks & you can thank me later. the things i sit through so you don't have to, honestly...

this is one of the worst movies ever made. i can't believe how bad it was. i was shocked at the awfulness of the "ghoulies" masks. they are obviously halloween masks! the mouths don't even move when they talk!!!!! why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comical and goofy? whenever they do anything there seems to be this circus-like music and overused bonk and boing noises when they hit people. the bondage dominatrix lady is one of the worst actresses i have ever seen. this movie is just bad. the plot is nonexistent. the mom from one tree hill is in this though and she has obviously had a nose job since this was made. why did the main character from the first movie return to make this garbage? bad bad bad movie.

this is quite a bad movie but oh well, this movie is at least not as lame as the third ghoulies movie.yes, this is a bad movie in terms of its writing, directing, acting and basically everything in between. it has such a weak, simple and ridicules story, that besides has little to do with the previous ghoulies movie entries. it tries to connect the movie with the first movie "ghoulies", from 1985 but then on the other hand, if they really wanted to connect this movie with its predecessors, then were are the ghoulies in this movie? instead now we are having some small people, played by tony cox and arturo gil, dressed up as demons. not that the ghoulies from the previous movies were any classic characters but they were nevertheless the heart and soul of the movie and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun. it's like having a gremlins movie without the gremlins.the movie is not really interesting to watch because it lacks any tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically everything else you can think off because it got put together by persons who obviously aren't the most talented ones within their business. just like at director's jim wynorski resume, with movies such as "the witches of breastwick" and its sequel, "alabama jones and the busty crusade", "house on hooter hill", "scream queen hot tub party", "the bare wench project" and the sequels "the bare wench project 2: scared topless" and "the bare wench project 3: nymphs of mystery mountain" and "the da vinci coed" on it. yeah the movie is quite silly and campy but this is not really enough to boost this movie and gives it some more entertainment value. you know, it's the kind of cheap looking movie with some lame special effects, costumes, make-up and actors nobody has heard of ever since.still it isn't the worst movie out of the series because of the reason that "ghoulies iii: ghoulies go to college" is by far a more worse movie, since that one had some horrible lame attempts at humor. this movie at least still does some attempts to be serious and professional one, even though the end result is far from perfect.bad movie making and perhaps only watchable for those who have seen the previous ghoulies entries.3/10

the only good thing about this film is they managed to tie it with part one! but other than that it was one of the worst films ever! the only time you see the ghoulies is in a flashback (and the flashback is just clips from part one)! a must not see! on a one to ten, "ghoulies 4" gets a one!

all movies that contain "goofy sound effects" should be shot. if there is one thing i hate, it's gotta be the use of a "whoop whoop whoo" when somebody gets hit one the head. the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar, and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle... or rather, fanning him with a beer bottle, because she never really hits him with it. yes ghoulies iv does suck. but i have to wonder, did they mean to not make the so called "ghoulies" mouths move when they supposedly talked? their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2. hell, i can make a better mask out of construction paper, some rubber cement and a handful of glitter. this sucked.

some things just won't stay dead. they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not. i guess some people like to beat a dead horse. the first 'ghoulies' was a surprise hit and it's first sequel was an even better film. the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome. i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise, but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries.pros: the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. a silly, but fun score. moves at an alright pace. some cheese for those who love it. some pretty good action-packed sequences. has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii & iii at least attempts to link itself with the original.cons: not nearly as much fun as it's predecessors. though it has more plot than before, it's a pretty ridiculous one. poor effects. the original ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they're replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs. speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are lame. is a direct sequel to the first film, but there are so many loose ends. for example, i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? not that it was spectacular in the others, but this film's direction is especially bland.final thoughts: the first three 'ghoulies' movies are a bad movie lovers' dream. this fourth, and so far final sequel (let's hope), is a bit of a letdown. sure there's some fun to be had, but it just isn't the same. the others are low budget too, but the people involved put a lot more into them. see if you're a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. otherwise just stick with the other three.my rating: 2/5

busty beauty stacie randall plays pvc clad, bad-ass bitch alexandra, the faithful acolyte of faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called lite and dark.now alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn't going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective jonathan graves (peter liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil alexandra is capable of. meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints lite and dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home.in the warped movie world of jim wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. ghoulies iv is no exception: every woman in this film¬ówhether she be a police captain, a curator of antiquities, or a mental patient in an asylum¬óis hot, hot, hot and wears not a lot, and it's this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable.but be warned, even though the presence of semi-naked, quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier, there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humour (as the dvd blurb describes it) is about as funny as a knee to the knackers, with the comedic banter of lite and dark being particularly cringe-worthy; and the special effects are bargain basement, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier.3/10 solely for the high bimbo quotient.

i don't know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases.. they were all straight to video films. same with the puppet master series. why hasn't anyone noticed this yet? right, somehow you've stumbled across ghoulies iv, probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993. you looked in the discount section and found this...look at the back and front covers. what do you expect, the shawshank redemption? there is no need to review this film so critically. it is the fourth ghoulies film! i bought it on dvd for ¬Ä6.50 because... it was ¬Ä6.50.. i knew it wasn't kubrick material. and i was right. an unremastered dvd with no extras, not even a trailer, boasts an uncared-for film.it actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film, peter liapis... who really didn't get many 'big' roles apart from those two films. and i don't see why... he's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun. but i guess if you're gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films, scorsese and tarantino will lose interest. also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco, who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino (very small), retains none of his acting ability... a complete idiot who's just awkward to watch. then there's stacie randall - obviously a porn star, i don't need to look that up. she does look quite sexy, though her costume, her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility, which is no easy task for such a film.then there is the ghoulies themselves! who also manage to let us down. ghoulies iii made them start talking, mistake no. 1, but ghoulies iv takes it a step further. instead of being puppets, this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes!!!! the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers. also, there's only two of them, and they're not the main highlight of the film, as they don't appear in a lot of it. however, at times they are mildly amusing... and they're not evil this time either.this really is hilariously bad stuff, it's amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it. i dunno why... some of the black humour is actually funny, though the script is mostly effortless. imagine satan's only threat to you being that he will "kill you, slowly...painfully...".but at least full moon had no involvement this time. did they? yeah, a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value, but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master 1/2, lawnmower man 2, surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii.

this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time. there are almost no "ghoulies" in it at all. there is nothing good about this movie on any level. just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat. avoid at all costs.

just caught "the rain people" on turner classic movies late one night. the film was released in 1969. shirley knight stars as natalie, a long island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player "jimmy" (james caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking. there are many twists and turns along the way between these two, as natalie struggles to take care of jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. she is going through her own struggles, needless to say, and in no position to care for him. natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband, who begs her to come home. natalie tries to dump jimmy several times, only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances. a young robert duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends natalie. you get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly, and it does. this film is certainly uneven at times, and the script is somewhat lacking. francis ford coppola directed this, and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing "the godfather." the actors are good ones, needless to say, as they all would have futures ahead of them in film. shirley knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underrated as an actor. james caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character. this film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is an early movie of coppola's, and i confess i had never heard of it. so god bless turner classic movies for bringing it to a new audience.

this is not a good film by an standards. it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par (some performances are well below par, but swayze and grey do a very good job with little to work with).what was good:the dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as stated above, swayze and grey were high points.what was bad:the script. the "bad" guys were simply too evil to be believable. the best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil. these guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people (perhaps there are guys like them, but i sure don't want to see a movie about it).another scene, the first where grey and swayze meet when the employees at the resort are "dancing". swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves. the next time they meet, swayze is hostile towards her. why? what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together?and some of those lines, i mean come on (i cringed at the end when swayze muttered the line "nobody puts baby in the corner". how did he ever do that with a straight face.)another thing wrong, the setting of the 1960's. everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's! who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles?the music (original music for the film) was laughable (with the exception of "i had the time of my life" which was a good song).not the worst film i've ever seen, but definitely the most over-rated

you know, as you get older, you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger, might have been because of your youth and inexperience. case in point, when i saw the godfather at age 14, i thought it was boring. 20 years later, its an incredible movie to me. in other words, i grew up and began to appreciate great movies.so i rented dirty dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request, as she loved it at age 14 and i hated it at the same age. but i hoped, because i was young and stupid at age 14, perhaps this would be a new experience for me. so i sat down with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened.well, the night after watching dirty dancing, i feel a violation. i feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest.first, patrick swayze plays a 20 year old, but he looks like he is 35. and the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager, wooing her with his dance moves. really creepy.anyway, the movie is the clich√© plot where the "wrong side of the tracks" guy and the "rich smart girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. of course, their romance is fueled by the fact the "rich girl" can't dance a lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show, or something like that.but you guessed it: the disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other, and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making. this all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man.even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered. i didn't press her, but i did smirk a little, and put the godfather part ii in the dvd player.

stripes, an army training camp comedy starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman, is a favourite of mine. meatballs, a summer camp 'romp' starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman, is a complete waste of time. it takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word 'comedy' infers a work with mirth aforethought) as witless, anaemic and boring as this.murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him and his flailing attempts to inject life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment - the "it really doesn't matter" chanting scene is excruciating. it doesn't help that the supporting cast is bereft of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then meatballs was made in 1979. ("and introducing chris makepeace as rudy" announce the opening credits. no, not the chris makepeace?!).mercifully, reitman rectified his mistake two years later for stripes. murray's shtick is so much funnier when he's larking around with the likes of john candy, warren oates and john larroquette. ditch this and watch that.

this might be for those who have been to summer camps, but it sure isn't an entertaining camp. i went to one before, but it didn't make me scream up and down for joy. instead, it made my head hurt.the first thing you notice is that bill murray actually had some hair in the 70s. yeah, and he also didn't mind running some. but to get him to run a lot, you would need to give him a woman to chase after.its not that some of the stunts can't be funny. for example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed. instead, its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed. it just failed to be funny.to somebody who loves comedy, this is a pain. others are glued to it for life. i wish it was more like leonard part 6, but it doesn't come close.

i will never go to another tarantino movie again. the entire film was worthless. my wife and i both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! we, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering "that was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "i should've walked out", "where was the comedy", "that was pathetic", etc. it actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. the only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. i rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. i can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!

i am sorry folks, but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this kindergarten nonsense.so why this verdict?first of all: the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! it is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know. this story could have come out of every little kid's head. it doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. doesn't work. even the previously seen cutbacks that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. second: some guys go to germany and kill nazis. ah really? do they? the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis? a brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the "basterds"? certainly not --> fail and what happens to the terrible nazi-killing basterds? well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...third: any characters? yes one! the only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is chritoph waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. great acting! brad pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by waltz. never seen a such a weak performance by pitt... and the rest? well, some germans you've never seen before and will never see after. when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven basterds i hoped to see something like the "magnificent seven": a group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... i was then very disappointed, when i saw the "inglourious basterds". no details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... but in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the "inglourious basterds" except pitt hardly play any role in this movie...so i was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened...

i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind. i have been a big fan of qt in the past, i think we can all agree he has made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own fundament. this "movie" proves that. it consists of few scenes of the basterds at work. it consists instead mostly of long, tedious, boring stretches of conversation between people that, after a while, you realise you just do not give a stuff about. it's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that qt has been responsible for in the past. the entire movie is anticlimactic. there is no tension - what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care. honestly folks, don't believe the hype. this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it.

previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. this one is from a guy in love with his own writing. it isn't inglorious, its disgusting.i absolutely hated inglorious basterds. the entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. even woody allen knows when to shut the f**k up.this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark, but in other films, i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. here, i couldn't care less. all of quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly jackie brown. but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.is it violent? sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. thankfully, the film was so thin, i didn't even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on msnbc.he's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. but do us a favor qt and spare us the movie.i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.i give it 0 / 10.

seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((the following contains spoiler)) hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole nazi - jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the nazis.

oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! this film was so close to a masterpiece, alas it was not to be, as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the moon. the mst3k version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called captain cody, where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the moon, but it didn't quite add up.also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as i expected them to be. all in all, a great disappointment.

there must be an error. this movie belongs with "plan 9", and a lot others as a quite entertaining, silly diversion. you'll never accept you like it, yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on tv. it's as simple as that.

mexican 'classic' was the third entry in the aztec mummy series. as you will soon find out, this movie is anything but a classic, instead, it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you.some scientist wants to steal aztec treasure from a tomb, but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial: the aztec mummy. knowing he can't beat the mummy, he then builds a robot, and a very bad one at that. we only get to see mr.robot in the last reel, as he clunks around, and does battle with the aztec mummy.i have seen a lot of lousy sci-fi films, hell most sci-fi films i see are lousy, but this one, for it's entire duration of 64 minuites, is the worst movie i've seen, with fubar coming in a close second....in conclusion: don't waste your time.

with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, i don't think that shakespeare is in any great danger. this is the story of an ancient aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised. his stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off. he seems to know who's doing this even though he's a gyrating, raving entity. i loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. there are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard, full of cheap crosses and other junk. there's a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. i can't begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robot, a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. the dialogue is awful. there are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines. i love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). nonetheless, if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously, watch this. have a couple beers first. like a direct line from the mummy's tomb, "watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." what more can i say?

**spoilers** the third and mercifully last of the aztec mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the mummy- actor ramon gay, as dr. eduardo almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on may 28, 1960! still that didn't stop gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.in "robot vs the aztec mummy" we have the once again mad scientist dr. krupp trying to get his hands on the mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern mexico city over 500 years ago. "robot vs the aztec mummy" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous aztec mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.after getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous aztec mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane dr. krupp also know as "the bat". dr. krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed orson wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. an idea he must have gotten from watching ed wood's 1955 "atomic superman" classic "bride of the monster".unable to handle the mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, dr. krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the mummy, for him. with he mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local mexico city cemetery dr. krupp has his robot-man brake into the mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. ***spoilers*** the big built-up to the aztec mummy robot-man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the "tin-man" in less then 30 seconds together with its creator dr. krupp. all this while both dr. almada and his friend and assistant pinacate, who came to the mummy's aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. now without the mad and off-the-wall dr. krupp annoying it the mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like dr. krupp, that it has really no interest in.

this movie plays out like an english version of an abc after school special, with nudity. it makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be. it's not as though the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot either. while it does possess a certain watchability, virtual sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue. it's a good movie to watch if you're snowed in, the cable's out, and it's the only tape you've got.

it's hard to tell who this film is aimed at; the characterisation and style smacks of a "children's itv" series crossed with an aussie soap, yet the subject matter, nudity, and language aims it at an older audience.the first half-hour has the heroine justine philosophising about losing her virginity, and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18. a complete rip-off of "ferris bueller", from the talking-at-the-camera bit down to the on-screen graphics.her nerdy friend chas brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man. or actually, creates a male alter-ego of her, called jake. don't look at me like that; i'm just relating it the way it was shown.after this the film is mildly amusing for a while; amongst all the drama-school mugging, only rupert penry-jones brings a real comic touch to his woman-trapped-in-a-man's-body role of jake. there's some funny scenes with jake dealing with his new body, and new feelings; nothing you haven't seen before, but then in this film you'll clutch at anything that's entertaining.unfortunately justine and jake meet up, and hilarious antics ensue (i wish), involving the owners of the virtuality machine who want to kidnap jake in order to have sex with him, or examine him, or something. anyway, it's just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases; for such a cheap looking movie, the explosions come often and loud, suggesting the money was spent in all the wrong places.in the end, the heroine realises she can't fall in love with herself, deletes her alter ego, and ends up in a one-night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity (this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in the 90s). but only after he removes his glasses and puts some hair gel and a leather jacket on; god forbid she actually have sex with someone who _looks_ like a nerd. of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of pc movies which tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it's refreshingly reactionary to have a film which screams "conform!" at you, and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve.the characterisation is simple dire; the nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there's a slut, she's very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, vampy accompanying music), there's a jock, he's very... well, you get the picture. you can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy, but "virtual sexuality" isn't very funny. it's only mildly amusing in parts, and excruciating in others. it takes a lot for a woman as cute as justine (played by laura fraser) to annoy me, but she manages it.don't be fooled by the title; there's absolutely nothing erotic about the film, and it doesn't deal with the topics of how the new communications technologies are changing the way we view and acquire relationships (unless you actually think there _is_ a chance your playstation might blow up and change your sex).

oh dear. this was quite possibly the worst film i have seen in years. i mean what more can be done with the old "woman inside mans body" storyline? it was full of cliches, eg the nerd coming into his own sequence, the "lad" getting whats coming to him etc. im not calling these spoilers because any one could guess what happens!! the only thing it had going for it was laura fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the "dream" boy, that was the wettest piece of acting ever. even the bad guys were instantly forgettable.terrible movie.

laura fraser creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and he's suddenly brought to life, of course. oh what jolly japes don't ensue in a britcom flop so day-glo bright yet so dismal it manages to make the execrable 1980s american teen flick weird science look almost decent. the sex-obsessed script is by the sun film critic nick fisher, a former teeny-mag 'agony uncle' who's obviously never watched an episode of smack the pony in his life; shame, because then he might at least have been in with a shout of writing female characters that were recognisably members of the human race. this knicker-twisting lot have all too clearly emerged from the virtual brain of someone who imagines they're amusing. suddenly, the thought of new-wave iranian cinema is somehow attractive.

following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one, this incredibly dull, slow, and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown. once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the bat (hammy luis aceves castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the aztec mummy popoca. the bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal. flatly directed by rafael portillo, with a talky and tedious script by alfredo salazar and guillermo calderon, cruddy continuity (for example, the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but is miraculously alive and well here!), an excruciatingly sluggish script, an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks, a meandering narrative, a crippling lack of action and momentum, largely dreary going through the motions (non)acting from an understandably disinterested cast, and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot (the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash, but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom), this numbingly dry, drippy, and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout.

justine cannot find the perfect mate to make her first time the perfect one. with geek friend in tow, she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance. when she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination. problem is, how many obvious sex jokes are left anymore? how predictable can these kind of movies get? a few funny moments here and there, but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life. if you liked weird science or jokes about the 'fish out of water' combined with 'gender identity crisis', then by all means these 90 min, you could enjoy.

a british teen movies which centres around a girl (justine) accidentally creating her dream man (jake) in by the use of a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well¬Ö.not just one¬Ö) she gets trapped inside his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. it sounds a lot worse than it is, i found it more watchable for the reason that laura fraser was starring in it more than the film content, indeed she looks stunning throughout especially when she dresses in a red lycra dress in order to impress jake, wow!!, if only i had a virtual reality machine¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö

virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america. the only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an american film would and a cameo by ram john holder, which is always welcome. that's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter's night.

miserable film. not even to be compared in one breath with "to kill a mockingbird," or "in the heat of the night."yes, there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous. come now. would you really have elizabeth patterson, of all people, guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching? patterson, in her day, played everyone's mother and was the landlady in "i love lucy" before fred and ethel mertz bought the building.imagine exhuming the body so that it will not come out that the black man's gun killed a white man?claude jarman jr., who was so fabulous in 1946's "the yearling" appears in this mess. he still had those sad eyes. my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful film.to me, this was nothing more than a faulkner flop all the way.

the first 2/3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the american mummy films of the 30s and 40s. two lovers in ancient mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. one became an aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. and the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. so far, it's all the typical mummy film...though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the american versions. oh, and of course the aztec mummy looked really, really crappy.however, into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. why? i dunno--it sure didn't make any sense to have one. it seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the aztec treasure is buried. why does he need the treasure? well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! but first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.you've got to see these "human-robots" as they look like the enormous clunky robots from flash gordon and other serials but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! they really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie. both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy... and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.overall, the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end. however, for bad movie fans, it's a must-see--it's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends.

2/3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies, a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. and somehow it feels like a rip-off even though i haven't seen the stuff before. it's like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. i've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage, but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences, so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the motion picture public.i got to see it in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days. i give the movie some credit for semi-convincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor, but that's about it. the aztec mummy monster looks good, even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. but the robot is pitiful, although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. it's a "robot human" or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. i think that's considered an android. so technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie should be called "android vs. the aztec mummy", but i doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality. in fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good. even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak -- for example at one point the hero says "i might as well begin at the beginning...." what the heck kind of translation is that? couldn't they at least have him say "start at the beginning" so that it doesn't sound repetitive? a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie. it's the epitome of utilitarian film-making, just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. they put no more effort into making it than they had to, and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie.i will now cease posting about it on the principle that i don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it.

ah, such an original title for a very shoddy film. the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match. as a result, i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold. there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. the aztec ceremony had me laughing. i rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. the singing aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot. some guy gets a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that i really cared), and it's a whole noir mess. oh, and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. you won't miss anything exciting.

i saw this on mystery science theater 3000, and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable. i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. of course, you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old, but i've seen silents that were better. the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes. the cameraman apparently doesn't know what a tripod is, and had too much coffee, or something harder maybe, because the camera is always shaking around. i couldn't even follow the plot, but suffice it to say, this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life.update: i saw "epic movie" a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2. it's not the worst movie i've ever seen anymore!

i am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all that bottom 100 movies, and i do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. some of them, e.g. the infamous manos the hands of fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on your own without any friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema taste. la momia azteca contra el roboto humano, however, was not that bad. well, of course it's bad - it's silly, dated, corny, cheap, etc., there's an aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, mexican mobsters, etc. the montage is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, the fx and sfx are the best what the mexican low budget production could've offered, etc. etc. still, the movie is fun. it's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. sure it depends on one's sense of humor, however i'm pretty sure la momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. please note: the movie lasts for about an hour, and i think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. there's also another thing - watching la momia can give you a clue what was the whole sf/horror genre concept back in the fifties, when you compare it to the present day matrix era of cinema entertainment. i think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact the watches like la momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright), and very often receive a standing ovation.

despite having a very pretty leading lady (rosita arenas, one of my boy-crushes), the acting and the direction are examples of what not to do while making a movie.placed in southern mexico, popoca, the aztec mummy (real aztecs, by the way, did not made mummies) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in mexico city suburbia, during the first movie (the aztec mummy). in this second part, the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice...)into this appears the bat, a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (some idiot inside a robot suit) to control popoca and (get this) take over the world. the final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever witnessed. the funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious mexican movie studio!the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english (they dubbed the over-acting!). you should watch this movie through mst:3000. the comments are even funnier.

this movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets). be warned! the first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character. the actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. i must say, the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious.as for the robot, i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. the bat's "robot" consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body. as tom servo put it, "he's not that impressive; he doesn't even have knees!" that, and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room. but once he catches you, watch out! he'll disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? pluh-ease!).this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots. otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.

"rvam"'s reputation preceded it. i first heard of it in one of those medved style movie books, "the 50 worst movies ever" or "the golden turkey awards", or something like that. every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. so when the exposed film society finally got around to showing it, i was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. however, "robot" wasn't really all that bad. oh, this is definitely a "z" film through and through. some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for k. gordon murray imports) is awfully cheesy, and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a frankenstein, since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous "aztec mummy" movie, narrated with a voice-over by the leading man. a dead giveaway: anytime the question "then what happened?" is asked more than twice in the dialog, you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. in rvam, "then what happened?" or "what happened then?" is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. even without the structural problems, the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older american audience. for instance, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story. he includes a remark about doctor krupp, "a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal" and began his quest for the treasure that the aztec mummy guards. no background, no explanation, he just "suddenly turned evil". obviously, this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience. the clincher, though, is the "robot", the supposed "showcase" of this movie. this robot is the worst robot special effect since "undersea kingdom" or even "santa claus vs. the martians". compared to this hunk of junk, the tin man from the "wizard of oz" looked like the terminator chassis that chased linda connor through the foundry in t2. the aztec mummy himself is well designed and executed; he's recognizably undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, and yet distinct from the "boris karloff" bandage collection familiar to most american audiences. but whoever designed the robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. they could at least have given him some knees, for heaven's sake. in addition, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (i've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) then the movie basically just stops. that seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.in spite of all these problems, the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a coleman francis film or a larry buchanan film was. compared to "monster a-go-go" or "attack of the eye creatures", "rvtam" is like a coppola film. it's just kind of dull and boring and silly. the actors are competent (in a mannered b movie way) and reasonably photogenic; dr. krupp, in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and "phantom of the opera" suit. i often found myself rooting for him, in spite of his being the villain. anyway, i've seen much, much worse. file this with "samson vs the vampire women", under "interesting mexican juvenile oddities".

i have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what i go through so you don't have to).the first viewing left me half crazed and babbling.the second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little better.i only screamed in agony once. seems pocona (the aztec mummy)had the hots for a certain aztec princess who was"supposed to keep her maiden".obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it.(now that is severe!).but before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching aztec ceremony.the singing will make your ears bleed. anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate & bracelet guarded by that swathed slob,pocona.by this time pocona looks like he's been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb.his groans & moans sounds like he has a bad case of montezuma's revenge(or he read the script for this movie).that will make your breath stink. an evil dr von krupp appears wanting the aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons & screenwriting classes for cast & crew).he is called the bat because in the curse of the aztec mummy he wore a bat like cape, hat and something like a ski mask over his face.guess it's better than the laughing fat man. the bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world. he stresses this by rolling his eyes,laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery.he has cobbled together an invincible robot.looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 buick.this will make your eyes bleed.a company even takes credit for making this tin can! well the mighty showdown between pocona and the robot takes place in the mummy's new crypt having been made homeless earlier. about half of this movie is culled from "la aztec momia"never released in the us in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from jerry warren(see my review on "attack of the mayan mummy") and "curse of the aztec mummy".the robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters.if that and the plot doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will. my first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one. but after seeing "mayan mummy"(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching "robot" again, it garners a 3.you have to watch this with no expectations at all. then it can be naively pleasant.

the usual disclaimer - i do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless, bad, low budget and silly, although they may deserve it. these films are often funny, and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry. this film fits this model perfectly. it is a mexican monster movie, riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects. the makeup is not that bad, and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining, but this film is almost as silly as aliens vs predator and the script isn't half as slick (aliens vs predator might get a 1 from me, but i want to see it again before i commit).the plot is ridiculous, but deliciously convoluted. if you've read this far, you must really want to know... a group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters. most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) mad, and quite perverse. this mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (who looks a bit like the tin man from wizard of oz, but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head). an aztec mummy, discovered by the same 'scientist' whose wife just so happens to have been an aztec princess in a past life (don't ask), is pitted against the robot for the big "climax" the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs.for what its worth, given the budget and the utter silliness of the script, this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie. if you're into that sort of thing, go for it.

i`m in two minds about following , the film debut of christopher nolan . part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . in many ways it reminds me of the cult movie pi , a film i disliked , and i can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? oh well i guess following gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand imdb members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of memento ?

on humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair. the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed. it's not half as good any of those films.in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton. it comes as quite a shock to mackaill. she considers a show business career as a way for an income.bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in bogey.considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair. the part doesn't wear well on him.love affair is your average b program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.

as joe bob briggs would say, this movie relies a lot on the actresses' talents rather than their talent. this early 1990's show-the-babes-in-bikinis-fest has very little to redeem it, other than showing beautiful women nearly naked. joe estevez, martin sheen's little brother, proves once again that his movie career will be nowhere near what his brother's career is.avoid this one unless you like watching beautiful women in skimpy clothing. it's about the only thing that redeems it.

radio is possibly one of the best films i have ever seen while at the same time one of the worst. it made me laugh in places where you were supposed to cry, and made me cringe at moments you were supposed to laugh. it lacked any kind of character development which is usually crucial to a sentimental flick that this is. some questions, why did ed harris character take radio under his wing, this was not properly explained, and i'm sure their relationship(which is the main aspect of the film) is the most pointless if ever seen.who keeps on giving cuba gooding junior work, he is a crap actor and should be taunted heavily until he takes up another line of work.as true stories go, this is not that interesting. p.s the reason i said it is one of the best films i have ever seen, is because, despite it being complete pap, i still enjoyed it. laughing at the script, and most monologues which are truly the work of either am idiot or someone very clever trying to show how easy it is to release a crappy film about a retard who becomes everyones favourite joke. the fact of the matter is, cuba's character is comedy fodder for the people who watch the football matches.

i appear to be in the minority, but i thought "radio" was pretty awful. it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of "heartwarming" movies.the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained. we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad apples.you could see almost all of th big moments in the story from 100 yards away. when the movie wanted you to go "awww" or pull out your tissue, i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching "rudy" instead.there were some good performances by the cast. too bad they weren't given a better movie in wish to appear.

no offense to anyone who saw this and liked it, but i hated it! it dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot, also, too simple and the acting was so so...i would give this snorefest a 2 at the most

i am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving. not only is it hokey, manipulative, and melodramatic. it's also shamelessly offensive. the character of radio `gooding jr.' is paraded around as a cute little stuff animal, like a puppy that's so cute you just want to take him home.' this mentality is shameless; radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative device to draw sympathies from its audience. even more atrocious are the film's numerous moments, in which radio gets hit in the head/trips/falls over/etc. these moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because, `it's funny because radio is retarded' this is shameless, now i do not feel that the word `retarded' is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled, but this seems to be the stance the film is taking, `radio is retarded, but that's okay, because he's cute and we like him.' gooding's portrayal seems better suited for a john water's film than an inspiring family drama. to add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level, debra winger is uninspired in the role as the `stereotypical housewives' that the very reminder of her heinous monologues insights laughter in all who see the film. the score by john horner is pure sap always overlaying its tear some score over the tired cinematography. ed harris is decent in a role he could have slept through, but manages to retain much of the audience's attention throughout the film. in conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this travesty of a film, read the book, but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from american history.

this could have been a good tv-movie, but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie. as they give the viewer informations on the way (will the movie proceeds) i found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that in the beginning. then the whole trail would probably not have been necessary.when the movie ends you understand why she shot, and of course she is not guilty. too bad that the producer/director used the flashbacks this way, but on the other had the movie would not have been worth while at all.nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the evening.

am i the only one to notice that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is erroneous. actually it's a 15th century, right around 1620 if memory serves me, because the "realistic" ship in the movie is the mayflower, now as far as i know the mayflower never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia. i don't know who handled r&d for this film, but using the mayflower and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed.they even printed it on the cover art and the dvd. i wonder how may other people noticed this little blunder? not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful, i would have expected better from sam neill.

the vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a ripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. this random act violence sold it for me and i'm happy to say the rest of vindicator provided a veritable feast of cheese.the vindicator is about a scientist (david mcilwraith) who is nearly killed an explosion in his lab whose tattered remains are put inside an experimental body suit/armour. for some unfathomable reason he is fitted with a rage response activator, a device wired into his brain that will turn him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with any other person. they give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but i cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine. it is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit. what possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission? he predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit, along with the ninja assassin hunter played by pam grier (no, really).the vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy. it is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit. he also has a perpetually bewildered look in his eyes, that doesn't inspire fear or even compassion. i guess you can't blame him for that, most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces.the acting is of the really bad, stilted, 'i'm not sure what the character's emotions or thoughts are that this point so i'll take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random tone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera' school of acting. the actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part.it is after this initial accidental death that the vindicator goes after the scientists. strangely enough the whole rage response activator 'touch me and i'll kill you' thing doesn't play as big a role as you might expect with carl going after his former colleges in a reasonably detached manner. there was one scene where he rather brutally kills some street punks who push him around. i know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if he does look like c3po's retarded cousin. as it is they don't even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them. the only other time this rage response activator comes up in the movie is when old carl can't give his wife a hug. when hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so he'll be forced to kill her he casually remarks he has reprogrammed himself (off-screen naturally) so this doesn't happen. they could have left out the whole rage response activator thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it wouldn't have made a huge difference to the movie.there is an amusing sequence in the sewers as grier and her cronies track down the vindicator. due to his armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire 'vapourised acid.' for some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala ghostbusters. the vindicator fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of grier's goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out. the resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man hole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are. strangely enough grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the vindicator. this is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie, including the death of funky black scientist when the vindicator sends his van of a cliff. (this is after they capture the vindicator by trapping him in a giant lump of gello- no, seriously). there is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like a poor man's ned beatty, reveals his infatuation with carl's wife and tries to rape her. it goes on for about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wife's face, gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off. it is icky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence.the movies finale involves the vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits. for whatever reason all these other dudes are less kick-arse than carl, some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out. luckily for carl the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw. the only really memorable part toward the end is the death of grier. doing something i've never seen a baddie do in a movie before, in the middle of her confrontation with the vindicator she decides she really doesn't stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with his pistol.

"the vindicator" is a weird little canadian b-movie. at first glance it would appear to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "terminator" knockoff, but strangely enough it also shares some qualities with the original "robocop," which hadn't even been released yet when "vindicator" appeared (1986). coincidence? who knows? anyway, the story is thus: scientist carl lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a super duper secret government high-tech research lab, reporting to a sleazy boss named whyte, whom he butts heads with about project funding early in the movie. carl's got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "lab accident." but wait! carl's not really dead after all! whyte has extracted carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project, some sort of experimental bio-mechanical space suit. when carl wakes up inside his new body, he understandably goes a little nuts, trashes the lab, and escapes. this is a problem because whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with a "rage reaction" program, which will cause carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason. in hindsight, that little addition to carl's psyche was probably not the best idea.so robo-carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while, killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters, till he returns to his home and contacts his wife (this scene is supposed to be heartbreakingly touching, i guess, but turns out comical because carl's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says). he of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because she's in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. eventually whyte hires a gang of commando thugs led by "hunter," an apparent ninja assassin played by pam grier (!)to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation, using carl's wife as bait, and predictable (but laughably cheap looking) mayhem ensues.i'm a b-movie kind of guy but "the vindicator" was so half-assed that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly. i'm assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into stan winston's robo-carl suit design, because that actually looks pretty cool, but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap, made-for-tv kind of look. the script could've used a lot more work, but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of "robocop" going into production and rushed to get "vindicator" out so they couldn't be accused of ripping them off. either way, judging by the other comments here on imdb, i'm not the only one who's noticed the parallels between "vindicator" and "robocop," and obviously "robo" is the superior film, so there's no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described, at best, as a rough draft of "robocop" if it were made by an 8th grader.

it's times like these i truly wish i was a more avid reader of clive barker's literary repertoire, since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a movie of this stunningly 'visual' caliber. based on the novella "cabal", the story of "nightbreed" involves a behemothic amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic ghouls. a normal guy becomes linked to the strange world, called midian, through his dreams and his psychiatrist coerces him into believing he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months... thinking this to be true, he retreats to midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. the shrink, however, is right on homeboy's heals with a diabolical scheme to whip out the community of nightbreeds...wanting so much to love this movie, i was very let down in the long run. i have regretfully not read the story so barker's fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters was horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. i understand how the final cut was diced to hell and even barker show's moderate dislike for the overall product, but i just didn't "get" it. even if it is crucial to read the story, i feel like it should at least be translated to film in a way that it is still comprehensible for those unfamiliar with the literature. if "cabal" is as convoluted as this film than barker really milked a dead concept. couldn't help but feel a bit bored after a while, especially when things started getting increasingly ridiculous (somewhere around the jail scene i realized just how bored i was) - like a police department fearlessly going to war with midian like it happens every week! no one seems to think the idea of immortal monsters is a tad... strange. i did like the visual effects and all that crazy sh*t that went on in midian, especially that porcupine lady and that big headed sob... definitely an epic flick when you consider the massive quantity of effects and convincingly morbid decor. david cronenberg fills his position well as the loony shrink with his cool zipper-head potato sack mask, but we all wish he had done some behind-the-camera work to help save this heap... so, if you have a boner for clive barker material and fully grasp what exactly midian is, why they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (terrible idea!), and why these creatures reside there and how some punk kid shares a telekinetic link to it, you should probably check out "nightbreed". i'll look for "cabal" one of these days and hopefully gain some perspective... or maybe i'll just forget this travesty completely... until then, this is a poorly constructed and fairly tedious mess of a movie... watch "hellraiser" instead.

it's a bit difficult to believe that this came from the same director that gave us hellraiser. where's the style, the foreboding, and the charm? i mean, hellraiser is not a great horror film, but at least it had something. nightbreed is like a large ball of bad ideas poorly executed. from the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! the opening dream sequence shows too much for too long. our hero doesn't display professional acting skills (but no one expected that from this bastard genre). there are killings that one wishes were more interesting. then we have david cronenberg. the man was never really meant to be an actor. he fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist adequately, but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster. then we come to midian, a creepy fake graveyard with an over-creepy fake gate. this thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery in plan 9 from outer space. it gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. there is nothing really wrong with the character design and make-up effects here (well... except for the guy with no scalp, the guy with a pointy chin and forehead, and the fat guy with dark circles around his eyes), the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given them. barker's photography of the subterranean city is tired and this part of the story could have been made much better. some might call what follows spoilers. after our hero dies and becomes "nightbreed" we wait around to see what he'll turn into (there's talk of things that fly and werewolves), but when the time comes for him to change they appearantly thought their hero too pretty to give a decent creature design. with the turn in cronenberg's "character" the story just gets less interesting until the battle of freaks vs. norms (which is just bad). barker's mythology failed him here. there is no genius and little originality behind any of nightbreed. the picture could have used a larger budget, a serious script, and character design that doesn't leave you saying "oh...oh, how lame." what a waste. not scary, not cool, not even very dark, just weak.

you'd have more excitement cutting off your testicles than watching this, clearly a trick to get you to rent "descent" instead of "the descent", which is a much better movie.this is a total rip off of "the core" and much, much worse as regards special effects, i could do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of tinfoil, i mean come on!....that "mole" thing, bore more resemblance to a vibrating dildo than a subterranean vehicle .don't watch it - if you do you'll find the room your in has a funny smell for days after and you'll have this nagging feeling in the back of your head that you should go kill yourself or something.

i got subjected to this pile one wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching it. i can't get over someone basically doing a remake of a crappy high budget hollywood flop ("the core" with washed up actors like luke perry). if the high budget one flopped, what makes people think doing the same movie 2 years later with no budget would go anywhere? i was laughing through most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was (in fact i am shocked it's not held up in legal rather than airing on tv), and how it was basically the script of the core just redone badly, which if you have seen "the core", you know why doing it worse is funny, since the core was already so bad it was funny.if you enjoy getting a laugh out of really bad movies, this one will be right up your alley. the only thing i can say, is that i wish luke perry was able to have a career, because he isn't a horrible actor.. he just lands horrible roles. crappy made for tv movies that will only run on daytime television is pretty much one step closer to the end for him, if it wasn't for 90210 he would have a career.

for sci-fans this will be better than anything likely to be running on tv at any given time; that's about the best you can say of it. good points; repartee and sense of humour is less dull than usual in such movies, the plot is coherent and doesn't use any magical mystical revelations. bad points; the writers try to do good science but it falls down in direction and production (eg, a rock drilling mole using superheated rock drilling equipment breaks surface underwater with nary a bubble or boiling cauldron to be seen), the characters are clich√©'s and the plot unfolding is pretty stock standard. ok for a too-tired-to-do-anything-else type evening; but don't expect any major edification or even talking points really.

"the core" meets "crack in the world" (1965 made for tv). the acting is stock, the suspense predictable. once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from "the core" - basically the manned drilling machine - you end up with the plot of "crack in the world". "crack" was a truly excellent movie starring dana andrews. his team of scientists, working in south africa, drilled down to the crust and "punched through" with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy. one of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist disagrees. he believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole, but will instead form cracks in the crust. (possible spoiler) he is right. in order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. although i have placed a spoiler warning, i don't know if i really spoiled anything for either movie. and since "crack in the world is only available in very rare vhs format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter-blast works is probably academic.all in all, i rate "descent' just below average.

terry cunningham directs this sci-fi network original. all is not well in washington state and oregon; volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the pacific rim in the ocean. trying to keep the world from plunging in ecological havoc, a crack team of scientists led by dr. jake rollins(luke perry)take a massive earth drilling vehicle called "the mole" to chew its way to the earth's fiery core to avert impending doom. technical dialog doesn't really help or speed this movie along. the acting is lame, but then perry has always been laid back. you can only blame him for taking part. others in the cast: michael dorn, adam frost and michael teigen

the script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) "borrowed" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.but other than that, i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. it's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. far better than "supernova" which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. a note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. it would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.production values: almost passable. i've seen far worse in my time.a new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure. particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, "no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed." which is definitely not the case. a self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of "don't be so damn stupid in the first place." should you watch this movie? if you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. but do avoid "supernova" as i can assure you that you're not that bored. that definitely was not one of luke perry's better movies. this one is better. that's not saying much, but it is better.one dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.

this is a very very very bad movie !the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse.the special effects are unconvincing. the dramatic scenes are a joke. every step of the way you can see coming a mile away. the end is disappointing and there is no suspense. the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack.the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with.i do believe that the young female fans of luke parry will still see this movie however he has done better work. again this is terrible. very very very terrible. if you have a choice, look at something else.

this movie was so awful i don't even know where to begin...the only positive thing i can say about it is that luke perry gave a good performance. the entire movie was all over the place, there was no explanation as to the cause(only theories)of the eruptions, or rationals for their solutions or why it would work. it was ridiculous! all the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy, you just wanna laugh!! there was just no background to any of them. the "love" relationship seemed to have been added on to the script, it was so awkward. there's an army man; big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the "aaarrrgh!i'm the man!" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. the two sidekicks, who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys. and then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebody's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he's coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something...and then plays hero (cheesiest scene of all!!) to help the plan which is to do who knows what... its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene...in a nutshell; don't waste your time!

this movie is a great movie only if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it. as a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields. it is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the earth's surface. it also is funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. they seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage. also it is funny how much they make the coast line of washington state and also oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of southern california. the jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong. the director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2 "supossed" phd's.

this movie's script is indistinguishable from others, most notably the core, another bad movie. it's pretty clear why luke perry doesn't get much work, but to see the beloved lt. commander worf (michael dorn) resigned to something like this is just sad.i really can't think of one plot twist that isn't seen coming a mile away. that's not an exaggeration.special effects are very poor, even by tv standards. the lava flow at the beginning of the movie signaling the coming global disaster, starts things off at a very amateurish level. and it gets no better from that point on.

usual awful movie... i'll not bother you about the synopsis, just put together the core, armageddon, an evil-planner military officer and one or two solve-all nukes and you'll have the movie, if i can call it that way. seriously, nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives: the big one is approaching? nuke some places and it's over... a tornado wants to destroy "insert important city name here"? nuke "insert another important city here"... a volcano is erupting? nuke it! a nuke is near to go off? nuke it! coffee is cold? nuke it! you didn't like transformers? nuke yourself, but i can't assure this will fix things...in the end, how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another? i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke...

i just watched descent. gawds what an awful movie. right off the bat they depict a lava geyser and a note says that it is miles below the the surface of washington state. folks, there are no geysers deep in the earth like that. they thought it looked neat and in typical hollywood style they threw it in. and then there is that well that spewed lava. he dropped a stone and i heard a splash. steam would have erupted out of that well before a blast of lava could, if ever.and the acting was pretty bad as well. micheal dorn has sunk to a new low in jobs.what a dog of a movie. i bet the vote goes no higher than a 3.5it didn't look like scifi channel spent too much other than to have pretty boy perry as an attempt to draw.

i'm a pretty tolerable guy, when it comes to movies, even b movies. i routinely watch some b movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good, to just downright awful. i usually set my expectations really low before watching these types of movies, and even after doing that, descent was just downright awful. i really didn't mind that they were ripping off the core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. some scientists are worried about the earth's seismic activity, and must travel into the depths of the earth in order to stabilize the mantel. so what we get is a monotonously long set-up in which two dueling scientists played by luke perry and rick roberts have to work together on a top secret mission, named project deep. the man in charge, general fielding played by michael dorn, is secretly withholding vital information from assistant marsha crawford, played by mimi kuzyk. rounding out the cast is natalie brown who plays jen, a mission specialist who created the "mole" a drill which is used plunge into the depths of the earth.other than some pretty good special effects, and set designs, nothing about descent is worthwhile. the movie starts out fairly entertaining, but it gets bogged down quickly in a tiresome story about uncontrollable seismic activity, which has been done to death in other movies such as the core. descent also has a poor script, with useless, forgettable dialog between the characters. to make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. the attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny. the plot has gaping holes and some of the subplots are left untied at the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth. in closing this movie was just a cheap way for everyone involved to get a paycheck. there was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. other than some nice looking special effects, and set designs, this movie fails on every other level. the story is from the garbage can of hollywood, and the characters are uninteresting to boot. descent will simply descend you into boredom, and frustration. avoid at all costs.

this was pretty inevitable. this movie borrows from "the core" and from the film it borrowed from, "armageddon", and the films it borrowed from and so on. except this time there's luke perry too. this films version of the familiar save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes beginning in the pacific northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire. its soon determined that everybody on earth just might be doomed. so the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the earth and fix things (it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). there's even a line the tries to make the journey into the earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in "armageddon"). it's a sci-fi network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. there is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak cgi) special effects. not original and not all that entertaining. this is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, particularly if you've got beer.

on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic ,concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood, george lucas' american graffiti, we have cooley high. an adaptation of sorts by one eric monte, co creator of the popular 1970's cbs sitcom good times.cooley high was, and is, viewed as a black version of american graffiti.instead of central california ,as in american graffiti, we have the black slum of chicago's cabrini green as the backdrop for the story here. instead of america in 1962 cooley high is situated in 1964.the movie stars welcome back kotter's ,lawrence hilton jacobs and glynn turman as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters. it has garrett morris playing the principal who tries to keep jacobs' and turman's characters,named coceise and preach, out of trouble a great deal of the time.you know, i would like to say that cooley high is a worthy comparison piece to american graffiti or that it is a great film on its' own but i can't. the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad underside of black life in america.having the film in the cabrini green part of chicago doesn't help things.neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here. when coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet. when the gang visits the chicago zoo, one of the gang named pooter, has manure thrown on him by an ape. when the turman's character,preach, is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout(a dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at), he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! the high school, the homes of the characters, the bathrooms, just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty.if that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film. the use of violence and profanity in the film. cooley high may be an coming of age film ,but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american graffiti so much.motown records had a hand in making the film. the company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. but even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over. not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music,of that time period was more than just motown.especially in chicago. the song nearing the end of the movie, by the spinners' g.c. cameron, was not all that impressive. there have been better motown ballads that have been done, by better motown artists than cameron without question.the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film cooley high aimed to be ,american graffiti. it shows that preach,an intelligent but underachieving student went to hollywood and became a successful television writer. eric monte may have patterned himself as turman's character. the last shot of film show's preach running away from coceise's funeral ,held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the bleakness that cooley high came to represent. eric monte ,through preach and that final scene, had one little lesson for all of us when watching cooley high and for the love of the past. don't look back.

i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era - but i'd be lying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if i pretended that this big-screen spin-off is anything other than an abomination. the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there. by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father, moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant rage, most discerning viewers will have switched off. take that as a warning, unless you're keen on cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage.

-spoilers------------ i am a fan of 60's-70's french cinema but not necessarily of the more modern,so to be honest i watched this because of bellucci.she is very young here,extremely beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met with cassel,so it gives it some extra importance.the movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of depalma.then suddenly we are thrown to flashback,and the back and forth goes on which gets tiring.i don't mind one flash back,but do it and get it over with man!!!anyway,the movie is still interesting to me until a point when the first and definite hole in the plot,that allows for the rest of the story,never lets me enjoy the rest.i can allow for little holes here and there,but not to base an entire plot on hot air.this is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame.this is the main plot.i will go along,when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on,but in this story there's nothing really mysterious.bellucci-cassel are a couple ,then bellucci urgently has to leave for some job in italy(not the farthest place on earth from paris)and she leaves him a message,which for reasons later explained he doesn't get.ok,so what?don't these people have phones?supposedly she was away for 2months(not a century exactly) and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in paris to see how he's doing? of course not.instead,even after she gets back she forgets all about him.and thats fine,but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life.yet she failed to give him a call for 2months and then never tried to get back with him.and what about cassel's character?he was supposedly unable to locate her in italy,really hard to find someone in italy,its probably like siberia,especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts papers.and after 2months when she would be back,really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. one thinks she wanted to avoid him,but no,we find out they simply couldn't meet.so hard to meet in paris. ok,i don't need to go further,because this is the incident where the entire movie is based. what is even worse,bellucci is not really the star of this movie but this other girl bohringer is.

i love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie. however, in the first ten minutes of the movie i knew that it was going to be lousy. it was poorly acted and much too slow. on top of that it was very, very racist, sexist, antisemitic and homophobic. sometimes putting in racial, ethnic and other types of slurs has a point, illustrating the bigotry that exists. in this movie there was no point to the horrible bigotry and no one learned from what was being said. part of the problem is that it was an adaption of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950's. having this movie take place earlier in time would have made a little bit more sense. it didn't translate well to modern times and the writing was horrible. i don't know how the play was originally written but i can't believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one has made it to television and video in 1999. it was disgusting. don't waste your precious time on this one.

`afterlife' is about a somewhat arrogant, reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying, and finds himself looking after his sister, who has down's syndrome. he can't be bothered with her, and basically just wants to get her off his hands; he has better things to do. at one point he finds that he has to take her, by car (she doesn't like flying) across the country.if that all sounds familiar to you, it is probably because you have seen `rainman,' a film far superior to its imitator, `afterlife.' that it copies the basic premise (heck, it nicks a few characters and even scenes too) is not the fundamental problem with the film. the fundamental problem is that i did not care about these characters.the brother, kenny (kevin mckidd), is a bit of a womaniser. he has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story, and who learns to like the down's syndrome sister (again, this is taken from `rainman'). he is a journalist, trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal. when he ends up looking after roberta, the sister, he doesn't have much time for her, and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long. when she wanders off, he becomes even angrier towards her. am i spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a nicer, loving person by the end of the film?roberta is not determined to be 'normal'; she is 'normal,' and wishes people would stop treating her differently. she is played by paula sage, an actress who does have down's syndrome, and her performance is easily the best thing about the film; why did the screenwriter not explore her character more? well, probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story. when we surely already know the story anyway, didn't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating?for a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter (the father is absent; i think he is dead, but i'm not sure), it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer. the scenes are performed in such a standard, dull way, with such standard, predictable dialogue, that i found myself rolling my eyes.i have nothing against sentimentality in films, but it only really works if you care about the characters. here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that i didn't really think there was much to care about. `rain man' has an emotional climax, but that moved me, because i cared about the characters.talking of climaxes, this film has a stinker. there is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory; an unforgivably cruel trick is played on the audience. the sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the viewer. audiences aren't stupid, and they know when the film is cheating. what a cheap shot.there is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should. there are a few sequences that are funny, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, i can practically see the screenplay in front of me, moving predictably and uninterestingly, never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart. there are those phoney arguments that are reserved especially for the movies, where the other character knows exactly what the reply is. why don't supposedly 'realistic' films not realise that, in real life, anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can't express their emotions, and they might say things that don't make sense, or not be able to say anything at all? all of the actors in this film deserve better material. this film is not based on fact, but i think a documentary on a family with a down's syndrome member would be much more interesting. that way, we might have had truth and emotion. for some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something loudly and making a suitable facial expression.** (out of 5)

this film really misses the mark on most fronts. the accents are laughably weak, the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best.they've got a great idea, it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above.the writer seems to think by putting the word f*ck into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard. he's no brick top thats for sure.next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film.it's a crime to compare this to films like the business, lock stock and snatch.

sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie. are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it? i thought the hair,make-up and characters were poor 2 dimensional types. the story is doubtful,especially since all of the main characters are dead,or nearly dead. i think it's not well acted either...what was up with that hair on the main guy in the turtles? it looked glued on badly, and the sideburns looked like they were going to fall off at any moment. it didn't feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bands,and people. i laughed all the way through it,frank zappa looked stupid,so did mama cass, and so did the beatles. they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous. also the other band people like jim morrison,donovan also took a big hit at looking stupid too. kind of terrible,if this is how you remember these people. it's a poor history lesson on music,it's fictional the way it was made.

unlike most reviewers here, i hated this movie, simply because the writer/director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. too many film fans equate 'extreme self-indulgence' to 'film genius!', but i don't buy into that cult of personality. a film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a woody allen film, of course). *spoiler* (which is just as well, save your time...) there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that screams film-school hackism. the poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience ¬ñ which, first and foremost, is the writer/director. but the rest of the audience should look down on the surly, brutal nature of the porn biz, too. the flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry, looking down on each and every player it could bash. no matter, just love your writer/director. love those four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. but look down on it, too, of course. while the subject has the potential to be fascinating ¬ñ innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look, again, dull. partly because of its run time. here is something your auteur hero didn't try: giving the characters dimension. or soul. anything at all to give a hoot about, aside from genius that paul is, of course. but i'm not buying. i don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype. another overlong auteurist hack piece, with fifty times more hype than quality. i know some of you agree. the rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again. not my problem.

the original wasc isn't by any means a must see movie in the genre. in fact, if it weren't for it's chilling first 25 minutes there wouldn't be any logical reason for watching it. the remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick. now, i don't have anything against pg-13 horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame. when you see the pg-13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used for several times. don't even ask for gore or violence. i know that it's not correct to compare both the original wasc and the remake, but i think that it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original. the tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake. not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning. no tension, suspense, thrills...nothing. the movie goes too slow before it gets a little "interesting", and that's when the stranger appears. the chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of "what will happen next?". but that's it. the situations that set up for the climax are predictable, boring, and lack of suspense. the original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie. now, i understand that this is a pg-13 horror movie but, if you pay respect to the original. why change it's most important situation? the children are not supposed to survive! after the ending i felt like this movie was pointless. so the baby sitter was playing cat and mouse with a wacko...that's it?. then, the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid. and worst of all, it means that a sequel may be on the way. camila belle is the best thing about the movie. she delivers a cute, believable performance. she needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans. please, don't watch this movie. some people say that in order to support the horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out. i don't necessary agree. if we ignore movies like wasc then the producers of horror movies will understand that we won't accept crap. we want good horror movies, not lame flicks filled with false scares. watch the original "when a stranger calls" instead because it's first 25 minutes are way better than the whole (pointless) remake.

when a stranger calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like poseidon just over the horizon. director simon west (con air) helms this updated version, with plenty of relative unknown casts, which signals either the death rate is high (it isn't), or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey.clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes, it's primarily made up of two acts. the first, which takes a full one hour, is the setup. our heroine, jill johnson (camilla belle), chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the math), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her. to pay off her debt, she works part time as a babysitter, and looking after the wealthy mandrakis' kids, is her first stint.the huge mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment, as it is where all the action will take place. plenty of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool sized aquarium-pond (to get wet in, for the wet t-shirt treatment), and check this out - motion detector lights, which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows. naturally, prank calls, red herrings are aplenty, which chalks up this act's runtime, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department.there's a minor trend emerging, with actors being the unseen, providing and acting through their voice instead. recent attempts include edward norton in kingdom of heaven, and hugo weaving's v for vendetta. here, lance henriksen does the honours for the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. why? the script doesn't give him much dialogue. most of the phone calls made were of the silent (mind-masturbatory) nature, which i felt was a waste - they could have also casted some unknown instead, and the job will still get done.the second act, where the main action takes place, is too little too late. and the bogeyman, well, is purely a bogeyman. those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed, as basically it's a one -woman show to hold your attention in the first hour (eye candies always succeed), and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time, ala rachel mcadams in red eye. don't expect any form of character development, nor subplots that will engage.the ending tried to be too smart for its own good, and came across as a cheap way to end the movie. there's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie - no scares, no thrills, no enigmatic villain, and plenty of security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only thing it's good for, is to provide a number for 4d.

simon west's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience. starring talented teen camilla belle, when a stanger calls fails to even elicit a shocked, or even surprised face. poor attempts at scaring the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows. the plot follows jill johnson (belle), a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via babysitting. she is invited to work for the night at a house by the river, and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash. but little does she know, a stranger lurks in the house, and constantly harasses johnson via the phone. a pathetic excuse for a film.

this is so overly clich√©d you'll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes. the beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone gets killed. this movie would have been better, set on this setting.so, jill johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend issues. i don't see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story.since jill has come home late, her father sends her to babysit for the mandrakis's in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning, another empty house to the side for their son who's at college. ok.after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself, she gets a couple of hang ups. ooh, scary ones. to which her friend comes to the rescue, to come up with a couple of high school lines about 'love' and whatever. friend leaves and goes to her car. to which then, she drops her keys. uhhh...then the music! dumdumdum..! she fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. which of course, doesn't start. how clich√©'d is that..? so..she disappears =d jill, alone again. uh. (most of this movie is with her by herself, so there's not much dialog) so more hangups, she calls the police. who say they cant help her, but call back if she has any more problems.so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriends friends are calling. they have been but only once. like thats supposed to be scary much? oh, and did i mention? her friend just now comes on caller id and some creepy man voice comes on. she gets all freaked out and shyt.yeah, so skip that. she see's the light in the house of the mandrakis's son go on. so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in. bleheh.ah its so boring i cant continue!!!!!!!!!

while babysitting at an isolated colorado house, a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone.remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span! so it's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. there's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie. there's a lot of camilla belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares. it all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills. it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since it wimps-out and changes one important plot point from the original. i guess we have the pg-13 rating to thank for that.on the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere, unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub-par. belle's performance is pretty mediocre too.it's just another unimpressive remake.* 1/2 out of ****

this would have to rate as one of the worst films of all time. the film screened at the italian film festival in melbourne, australia. after the screening, not only did i want my money refunded, i wanted the 1.5 wasted hours of my life back too. i have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some european film-making, but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone. this film is proof that while such selections may satisfy the egos of the film-maker and the selection panel, there is absolutely no joy for the audience. there is no character development whatsoever, the plot is a garbled mess, the style is nonsensical, the shot selection is appalling, and the editing is worse. by the end of the first reel, you'll wonder if you walked into the wrong cinema, and by the end of the third reel, you'll be begging to be put out of your misery. this film is an abomination.

i agree that this film is too pretentious, and it is not easy to know where it is going. i have been teaching literature and film for many years, and i find this film to be one of the most over rated, according to some of the previous reviews here. however, let me remind you that this is the same director who has l'ora di religione (il sorriso di mia madre- my mother's smile) to his credit -- a gem of a film! was he trying to outdo fellini's 81/2 here???? the scene with the dogs, which has also been pointed out, is absurd and excessive ¬ñ just one example. others would take too much space, and some reviewers have already noted them. overall, a most frustrating and annoying experience!

the film made no sense to me whatsoever. good actors(sergiocastellittoaparticular favourite; he was great in "uomo dellestelle"/"thestarmaker"but that was made by giuseppe tornatore, a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort),but awful, rambling script, terrible editing,and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say, and ended up saying exactly nothing. apretentious load of rubbish, but the sort of film that certain italianpseudo-intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it, and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these, they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece. i never thought much of bellochio as director. i remember seeing his first film "pugninella tasca"/"fists in the pocket" (or some such title) in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago (i was living thereat the time). all the usual pseudos raved about it, but it left me pretty cold. i didn't think he was much of a director then, and still don't. age has certainly not improved him, and this film must rank as one of his worst.

we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. well, we got it home and could not believe what we saw. its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. the main character is all over the place... one moment, he is like an immature little kid, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker.the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy, but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. nipple slips, close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. we were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. if you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch's... this is for you. if you are looking for something beyond that, this movie was empty. the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.

i want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the english subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. but if so, director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with √©lan and unique personal style (e.g., david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky). others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., krzysztof kieslowski, and david cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). in pola x, carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. i liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to andy warhol's 'factory' of the '60s?). much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. and, even well into middle-age, cathering deneuve shows that she still has 'it'. her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos.there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as "pola x" more charitably. experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn't work. but carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. at this early moment in the 21st century, one is left asking: with the exception of jean-pierre jeunet, are there *any* directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore? rating: 3/10.

this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen.we are supposed to like and be rooting for an arrogant, know-it-all, trashy bank robber, played by dale robertson, and a coy tease played by the extra-ordinarily beautiful linda darnell in a fire engine red dress. she must have been sewed into that bodice! a senator in the film thinks native americans and whites should try to come to an understanding, the bigots, however, win the day. i could barely sit through the endless dialog of bigotry that issued from the other characters mouths.except for wounded knee and dances with wolves there are few films that give a positive portrayal of american indians, and very few old westerns do. this one is exceptionally bad in that regard.the romance between robertson and darnell set my teeth on edge, as he came swaggering in, forcing a kiss on her, while she plays the old hard to get game.there are scenes that are unintentionally humorous, such as the characters obviously not really riding in or on a stagecoach in several shots.a puzzlingly humorous incident in the storyline is linda darnell's character going to great lengths to purchase tickets for the stagecoach, only to then demand a horse to ride, minutes later, for no apparent reason.another humorous scene is when the stagecoach comes to a screeching halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road, and not only that, but then all the passengers pile out for a look-see.1 star.

scenarist frederick fox's sometimes memorable dialogue and a study cast of old-pros cannot save this lukewarm western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty cheyenne indians. other than his occasionally catchy dialogue, you won't find any surprises in fox's screenplay about this run-in between whites and indians. the characters in "dakota incident" generate only minor interest, certainly not enough to make them stand-out as much as some of fox's choice dialogue. unfortunately, good dialogue is fox's only contribution because this conventional little sagebrusher withers with a lackluster ending that contradicts its previous 80 minutes. the ending is as contrived as they come and lacks credibility. most of the characters are sympathetic, but some just plain lack common sense.dale robertson is appropriately tough and leathery as outlaw john banner, one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his low-down, no-account partners. veteran western character actor john doucette (rick largo) fares the best of the badmen, while skip homeier, wasted in an inconsequential role as banner's brother frank banner, later dies from an indian arrow. doucette tries to gun down banner at the outset of in the action, but our left-handed gun-toting hero fakes his own death, tracks down largo down later and slaps leather with him in a town called christian flats. naturally, largo bites the dust this time, but banner makes an interesting discovery. one of the passengers on a stagecoach from christian flats to laramie turns out to be none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money. not only is john carter (john lund) on a quest himself to find banner, but also he wants to clear his own good name with the bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest. evidently, the authorities have mistaken and enlarged carter's role in the robbery. carter is prepared to take banner to laramie and turn him over to the law, but banner has other ideas about laramie. banner's ideas change when he crosses paths with amy clarke (former twentieth century fox beauty linda darnell) who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a bosom. as everybody else here has mentioned in their reviews, republic studio's truecolor brings out the red in everything, from darnell's fetching outfit to the blood spilled on the ground. the problem with director lewis foster's handling of this run-of-the-mill oater is that everything bogs down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hole up in a dry wash to defend themselves against the cheyenne. the good guys and the cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition, but "dakota incident" never runs out of clich√©s. ward bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the redskin. by the time that this 88 minute dust-raiser concludes, you'll feel like you've been trapped in a gulch and menaced by marauding cheyenne yourself.

dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i've ever seen. not good, but definitely strange.a driver-less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed. it's scheduled to go on, but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the cheyennes on the warpath out there. but linda darnell, regis toomey, john lund, whit bissell, and ward bond each have their reasons for going on. and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert, is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team.of course the cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film.dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j. yates pulled the plug on his little studio. westerns were their specialty, but normally of the kind roy rogers made. this would not have been a rogers product. in fact it's beyond belief. the characters aren't ground in any kind of reality. whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim, but robertson discovers it's iron pyrites, fool's gold. toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst. darnell is after a cheating manager of her's, but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him. lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for, but has to bring him in alive. for that he'd require help, but doesn't have any.but the worst is ward bond who's a united states senator on his own peace mission to the cheyennes. in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. he's really quite the fatuous fool, but i think that might have attracted him to the role.i tried to get into dakota incident, but couldn't. and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least.give it three stars for the cast involved.

this might have been an excellent flick. however, as many other people think so do i. it is poorly done due to the languages transfer. if the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else. it does have an excellent rating as far as i am concerned and i couldn't wait to rent it. but, once i did it was a real let down. out here in boardman, ohio i could not find an english version to anything similar. this movie was also compared to dark hours and this we will not get to watch in boardman, ohio. it is not available. so i guess we will never know how good the movie actually was.

there's something rotten about this film, and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his admittedly horrible situation. sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. the fact that he has been contemplating it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse, but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks, even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong. what a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist stephen hawkings, who suffered a far worse condition for far longer! yet with the morals upside down, the film revels in hero worship, and the people who disagree with are painted in simplistic idiotic terms. there's little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest(deliberately manipulating the real life encounter which was with a much younger priest). in that way i suppose the film is on a par with riefenstahls triumph of the will. the insidious idea is that everyone should have to right to take their life, when they feel they cannot live it anymore. it makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people evidently who believe you have the right to choose. the same people are likely to make a case for abortion. its all part of the current trend to get the suffering or sufferers out of sight, brush it under the carpet, mammy will say its. ok, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. so we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives, just ain't worth living, and then we'll decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves then we'll bring in the state to decide for them. enter adolf hitler straight from that other oscar contender "der untergang". hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what nature does in disposing of the weak. under his regime, there were forced abortions among the "weaker" strains", the mentally handicapped were quietly put away and the jews were "humanely" liquidated by using gas. he would have applauded this film, and why not for it is in line with his philosophy..."some lives are just not worth living". i differ from ramon sampedro, hitler and all the people involved with making this film. human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and an obligation. nobody chooses to be born. then who can choose death. its not about religion, its about protecting the weak and helpless, something this film does a lot to undermine!

great. another foreign film that thinks it's fellini. on top of that, we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people.i see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercials.i found nothing redeeming about this film. what can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on, in spite of some adversity. it does not take courage to commit suicide. that is the action of a coward. sharing this "wish" with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has. if this had been a film about a man's courage to go on, in spite of his problems, similar to the jill kinmont story, that would have made it a great film.if you're interested in seeing true courage, check out the movies about jill kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident.

bardem is great. actresses are great. but amenabar did not have to do it like this. it is ok that he defends his position on the euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. but doing it like this makes him lose his point: the movie is a false, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. women are incredibly attracted to this mind-sick man who wants to make someone to kill him, not understanding the implications of that. he seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring, love and attention. i think that amenabar might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it i believe is not correct. he could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it.

first, i would like to admit that chokher bali was not my cup of tea. this movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses. it's the type that critics would enjoy watching. the hype and publicity were quite misleading.i was expecting something very dramatic like devdas. understanding that the story and time-period demand it, i found the movie extremely slow-paced.i'm a die-hard aishwarya fan, and i regret to say that i thought she was miscast. the role of chokher bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. everyone else gave a good performance. tagore's depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.

for the people who have compared this trash to the brilliance of david lynch etc... please listen to your carer when they say... dont use other people's pc without their permission! this is complete and utter poo! there is no art here. this is some person trying to make a name for himself with a cluster of gross out ideas which he was not clever enough to enforce into one main idea so instead he went for the easy option. any one with half a brain could sit at home and conjure up some controversial images to shock viewers, but it takes a person with true imagination to be able to make it into a movie people want to watch.i am a lover of shock cinema. i have seen or own pretty much all you can get... and i can strongly advise to anyone who loves the world of movies to steer well clear of this garbage.this one is only for people who like to over analyze what they are watching, or for the 17 year old first time drinkers who dont know any better.0/10!

critics are a strange kind of people. some of them are common people like you and me. some of them are not. when a critic say subconscius cruelty is beautiful i wonder where they did grow up? what's beautiful with filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it with style and capture the mood of the environments. karim hussain for sure can't. i've seen kids do better footage than karim manage to do in subconscius cruelty. but that's not the worst part. the worst part is the whole recording, i refuse to call this a film, is just a bad excuse to picture nudity and extreme torture, rapes of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, pissing, cannibalism, child-murder and much much more. i love gore/splatter and i love horror. this ain't neither of those. this is utter crap and if my comments make just one single person skip subconscius cruelty it's been worth it. always remember that your life won't last forever, don't waste two hours of precious time on subconscius cruelty. you've been warned.

i¬¥ve seen this at the fantasy filmfest in cologne and left the cinema halfway through this "movie" (with a bunch of other people), so maybe i¬¥m not the right one to comment on it, but i think the fact of leaving "s.c." is reason enough to do so. "s.c." is a different film. people who need a coherent narration, characters or a plotline won¬¥t find anything in this one. it¬¥s supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. but these images have no power. they are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out, that they have nothing else to say. the gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the visuals are cheap. ok, the effects are good, but if that¬¥s the only thing, why care? husseins film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. note: not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore - especially not if everything is executed as bad as in "s.c.". i¬¥d suggest director hussein should either visit a psychiatrist or a filmschool, before he mistakes crap for art again. note: i never want to see a baby getting slashed during birth again.

this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made. the only thing i liked is using argento-esquire lighting in most of the scenes. the music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at 2x the speed and even then it would be slow. the story doesn't exist. it doesn't even have any shocking scenes.it is classified (on this site at least) as a horror, but it's not. it's a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature. if you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace, then watch it, but i'd rather recommend you something japanese (e.g. ichi the killer) i think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie. these 80 minutes of it's length would've been better spent watching the paint dry.i gave it 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu

being a science fiction fan from my early childhood (long time since) i always hated implausible plots. it's a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. i always suspected them of thinking: "children are to dumb to realise, so we don't have to strive". the writer of "science fiction (2002)" is no exception. the story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents, because they think that the parents are aliens. as intriguing the idea sounded to me, as much was i bored by its realisation. it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark, stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere. the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish"? and then - bang - they did not even try. so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, go and watch "klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.

first of three aztec mummies film is the only one that to the best of my knowledge was never completely dubbed into english. the film was chopped up and used in pieces by people like jerry warren in other films (he combined it with another mexican horror comedy with lon chaney to make face of the screaming werewolf. and it showed up in attack of the mayan mummy and elsewhere.) the longest of the three films, a good chunk of this film makes up the two later films which use this as a basis of flash backs. the plot of this film has a scientist conducting a past life regression experiment which causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden chambers in an aztec pyramid. the group, as well as a sinister figure known as the bat, hope to use the information to discover hidden treasure. instead they discover a living mummy who has other plans. long and long winded this film has way too little action to sustain its 80 minute running time (worse the mummy doesn't even show up until an hour has passed). probably the least of the three films, its easy to see why this film was cut apart, it's the only way to fashion a non-sleep inducing film. watching the film late last night i found myself fighting to stay awake. it was a tough haul and i found that i ended up scanning to the point where the mummy showed up. given the choice i'd take a pass and watch the second two films.

after watching the first movie in bci's new aztec mummy collection, it's difficult to believe how excited i was about the set and how upset i was when the release date was pushed back. i've watched a lot of mexican horror in recent months. some great ¬ñ the curse of the crying woman. some entertaining despite obvious flaws ¬ñ night of the bloody apes. and some cheesy ¬ñ pick any santo movie. one thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called "dull". well, that's not the case with the aztec mummy. it's been awhile since i last watched something so sleep inducing. i wasn't hoping for or expecting a great movie, but at least entertain me! the aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity. i guess that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material. padding extraordinaire! for example, for anyone who has seen the movie, what purpose does the bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes? i can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more entertaining than this one.

leatherheads is an apt title, however a leather strap would be more useful to self-flagellate oneself after purchasing a ticket to watch this noxious attempt at entertainment. clooney's attempt at self deprecating humor comes across with a quiet thud as his demeanor implies that he is anything but. perhaps with another actor playing the clooney role, the movie might be marginally palatable. sorry george, i doubt there will be any oscar nods this time. george clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy (unless you are referencing to his politics). anyway, only the most ardent of clooney fans will enjoy watching leatherheads, everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture.

check out the two octogenarians who review leatherheads. these guys are old-school hollywood and a hit on youtube. they always give an insightful and fun review. they have movie comparisons that are really interesting and they have a banter back and forth that is endlessly entertaining. they know movies, collectively they have been in the biz for practically a century. lorenzo is a well-known screenwriter and marcia is a famous producer. all of their insight on movies always leaves you with something to think about. see what they think about clooney's latest...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-w7evbears

how many times must i write the words boring and not funny on this page until i get to ten lines. george is about original an actor as alfalfa from the little rascals. although that is probably a slight to alfalfa. how many times do i have sneak into these overpaid actors crappy films before i will learn that there is but one law in the movie industry. take the money and make a movie - even if it is crap. they spend millions making this movie but can't take a few moments to watch the end result. and renee goawayzigger should stop taking the illegal drugs she is on and seek medical help for the facial problems she is sporting. at least i hope its drugs as she is quite unattractive whilst talking out the side of her mouth. this movie was neither funny nor dramatic and these hacks should just stop making crap like this. george and renee, you should be ashamed of yourselves and stop being stop stinking greedy.

i thought this movie was going to be good. it absolutely wasn't, despite the oscar-winning lead actors. i may have laughed once, and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing. renee zellweger's pancake make-up was very unbecoming. everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off. i think perhaps the movie must've sounded good in development, but something got lost in translation. were the roaring 20's really like this? i think not. everything seems a tad artificial. randy newman's score was annoying. the film is in sepia tones, just like every other movie that takes place in the 20's or 30's. there's just not that much originality here.

a lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film. ok, it had about as much to do with the actual nfl as your average war movie has to do with an actual war, or a western has to do with the true "old west". so, i think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one.the problem here is, the director (clooney) apparently thinks that making a screwball comedy means a) do stupid things, b) mug for the camera, and c) take stupid scenes full of mugging and stretch them out way too long. screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but moving briskly along at all times. here, things drag, and drag, and drag. after you watch this movie, it will make you appreciate how brilliant mack sennett was when he pretty much pioneered the genre with his keystone cops. after 90 years, you would think that directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two, maybe even improved on things a bit. but no, it's as if someone had watched an automobile pioneer build a duesenberg, and nearly a century later, paid homage and "improved" on the concept by cobbling together a child's wagon with square wheels.i've enjoyed several of clooney's movies, i consider him a gifted actor. but very few actors can competently direct themselves; clint eastwood notably took a while to get the hang of it. clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. the movie becomes more watchable during the very few times he is out of the frame, but when he's in the picture, he makes himself the centre of attention. in the fight scenes, his mugging is so obnoxious you wish somebody would thump him for real.if you are making a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in, you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female leads. clooney and zellweger have all the chemistry of pair of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. no spark, no sizzle, not even a post-mortem twitch. zellweger, who has also turned out some pretty good movies, must have traded her botox injections for oak tannin, giving a stunningly wooden performance. she might just have pulled off the "tough broad in a man's world" act if just once, while trying to out-testosterone the guys, she had looked into the camera with a little half-smile and twinkle in her eye. but no, she kept her jockstrap cinched up tight to the very end.of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie simply isn't funny. doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. doing stupid things very inventively, like the stooges, or very athletically, like buster keaton, can be hilarious. but otherwise it's boring and, well, stupid. i think i got one good laugh out of the entire movie.avoid this one. i saw it for free on cable, and still wanted my money back.

'leatherheads' tries so hard. tries to be light hearted. tries to be a comedy. tries to be a love affair. let's see, it tries to be a 'his girl friday' by way of 'the sting' by way of 'it happened one night' by way of a dozen sports movies. alas, trying isn't doing and the movie is as soggy as the last game's field.a fan of movies would watch the big fight scene in the speakeasy between the duluth bulldogs and some soldiers and realize that the fights that john ford staged with such style and verve and humor in movies like 'the quiet man' or 'donovan's reef', or 'the searchers' may have seemed easy to do but obviously aren't. i would bet george clooney thought channeling john ford would be easy as well. how hard could it be: masculinity run amok, punches, bottles broken over heads, an imperturbable piano player...just put it up there on the screen with some happening music. sorry. it takes a master to make fight scenes flow.movies aren't wished into existence. humor is hard. romance is hard. slapstick a lost art.i once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. something about not wanting to prick the fantastic bubble of the performance by hearing the thuds of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the lifts. this movie is like that...all strain and good intentions, handsome actors, nice sets, but it thuds through its paces rather than gallops like the original galloping ghost, red grange, who the movie is loosely based on.

i cannot comprehend how this picture was allowed to be made. it is mostly, if not completely, inaccurate so much so that the main character does not even resemble how history has him look physically. this movie made me go on the internet and go through my books to make sure i remember nero's personality correctly. for god's sake, i have a book that lists nero as one of the most evil person's of the world and the movie made me feel bad for him. i must say aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. although, the actors all did a good job, the movie was terrible and i'm sure i will not watch any others made by this sorry team.

sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie. but, i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster. the directing is really awfully bad. but, after i looked up its information here, i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing. maybe they don't have budget, but anyway, ang lee's sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit. the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself. it keeps pulling me outta scenes. maybe someone need to work hard on story line/ board. the dubbed sound is also awfully bad. my god.... normally, i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual. but, this time i am just mad , "i really wanna hit something hard." ...just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best. bad arts (its' not even art, what is it? )really hurt people.

"imperium nero" is the second movie of the series of six productions named "imperium". i have already unfavorably commented the first one: "imperium augustus". this second tv movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the italian state owned network has the same defects. in addition contains a considerable number of historical errors. some examples: nero is a child and agrippina calls him: "nero, nero". at that time is name was claudius. he was named nero after his adoption. nero did not meet acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with octavia and his nomination to emperor. when becoming emperor his sons where not adults: britannicus is one month old and octavia one year old. and many many more. if you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples. "imperium" series will continue with four more movies : "titus", "marcus aurelius","costantinus" and"the fall of the roman empire". finally!

for a good take on the roman empire watch the excellent bbc produced miniseries "i, claudius". this just sucked. the acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. hans matheson was irritating. cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated viewings. even caligula was tame. i think this film was silently supported by "religious" groups who shall remain nameless ;). the overt tones of christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if that gives any hint. stay away what ever you do - the running time is so long that i was able to read harry potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe.italy has done better - don't let hans cute face fool you. he is not a great actor...he is a great bore.

"nero" as the title of the movie is in germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting roman emperors, lucius domitius ahenobarbus, better known as nero. although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate nero than the amusing but completely fictitious nero peter ustinov played in "quo vadis!" it still is a major failure. and to those imdb-commentators who still believe that sueton and tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about nero that was published less than 20 years ago. nero did not burn rome, this is proved! he did not murder britannicus. he did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who banned the gladiator fights. the movie still shows a lot of mistakes, errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like some villa, the city itself looked like..well like a cheap set. the acting was between good and sub-par, the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after nero became emperor to a rushed, bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure. so there still is the potential for an epic biography of nero that shows the true nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled rome, despite the lies of sueton et al.

perhaps, we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen. perhaps, we expect too much from these films. however, if we, as viewers, are offered far too little, what happens then? that is what i thought after seeing imperium - nerone by paul marcus, a part of the production series on the roman empire. augustus by roger young, the first imperium movie, included at least peter o'toole but what does this movie include?hardly anything accurate. the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history. throughout the movie, we see nero young: young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula, young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own (historically 14 year long) reign. and...he dies the same. according to the movie, nero, born during the reign of tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies... continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie, which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable. nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. at that time, his mother, agrippina, is exiled by caligula. later, however, she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina. at these moments of the movie, we see acte (rike schmid), nero's mistress. all right, it is historically "accurate"; yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome. in the film, she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul's miracle (he brings a young girl marzia back to life). besides, there was, historically, nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula's 4 year long reign (a.d. 37-41). i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! and many, many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy.as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment, they are equally lame as the history here is. the performances are artificial, the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. perhaps, i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead, but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all. he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor. is he an artist who burns rome for a song? is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives? is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of "alleged justice"? none of these. he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and, in the long run, begins to release the fire burning within himself... john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character. elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea; yet she could have been much much better. the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze. low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment.but what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, i give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:- the death of poppaea and st paul's talk with nero at her dead body, - claudius' mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death), - tigellinus killing agrippina (laura morante), nero's mother, - nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, - finally, nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte "let us forgive him"all in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire. it's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been made at all.

what a disaster! normally, when one critiques a historical movie, it's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in, usually added by the writers to create more "dramatic" situations. however, "imperium: nerone" is a whole 'nuther kind of animal. in this movie you strain to find anything at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of rome's bad-boy artist-emperor.and it's a pity, because nero is one of the most fascinating of all the roman emperors. his life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie. the producers of this mess chose another route, which leads only to head-scratching on the part of any informed viewer.just a few examples: 1. nero is depicted as an 6-8 year old boy when caligula has his father killed for treason, exiles his mother agrippina, and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside. "ten years later," the story resumes just before the assassination of caligula. facts: nero was born about six months after caligula began his four year reign, and was only three when he was assassinated; nero's father died of natural causes; agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior, not treason; and nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family.2. okay, according to the writers, nero is now about 16 when his great uncle claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress messalina and marries claudius, who adopts nero. then he goes off to conquer britain, and is poisoned by agrippina soon after his victorious return. nero is declared emperor, although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old. fact: claudius conquered britain in 43 a.d., two years after beginning his reign. he lived until 54 a.d. nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology, but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16.history tells us that there then followed the "five good years," where nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher seneca and the praetorian commander burrus. this is shown -- sort of -- except that portraying the roman senate as opposing nero's good measures is false. senatorial opposition to nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing senators for real or imagined treason.3. nero's mother agrippina is the controlling sort, who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son emperor. after a while, nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her. in the movie, he sends his henchman tigellinus to stab her to death. all true enough, but the reality was so much better! agrippina was a survivor, and didn't go easily. nero tried three times to poison her, but as an old poisoner herself she was savvy to all that, and he failed. then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber, but that also failed. next, he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink; as it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam to shore. finally, he had her stabbed to death. now showing all that would have definitely improved this movie! other errors abound: nero's lover acte was not a childhood slave-friend, she never repudiated him, and there is no evidence that she became a christian. nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake. etc. etc. etc.the sources for nero's life are primarily the roman historians tacitus and suetonius, both of whom were of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory. but the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with the common people, unlike one of the final scenes where he is pelted by the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide.why did the writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie, and make this piece of crap? oh, and did i mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were? lol.one star, because there's no way to rate it lower.

i just attended a preview screening of this film. a masterpiece of documentary film-making it was not. totally absorbed with its subject, the film becomes incapable of leveling any sort of critical commentary with regard to ms. faye. cloying and sappy, the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt (albeit a failed one) to structure some kind of narrative. but the creepiest experience occurred as the closing credits rolled. the audience rose and applauded. like moths to flame, americans in the 21st century are still drawn to freakshows. the narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting rather tired.

there's nothing particularly unique or interesting about this run of the mill low budget sci-fi flick. regardless of its pedigreed origin (the film is loosely based on a novel by leo tolstoy), the plot and overall themes of this film are in no way remarkable or original, the science is weak at best, and unfortunately, the film fails to even involve compelling action sequences.the plot begins with a manned space flight to mars, and though the main plot doesn't really get rolling until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes occur en route. unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers touch-down, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculations about cosmology and the meaning of life, and everything interesting about the film all give way to an only remotely coherent plot concerning martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not very convincing webs of deceit.there is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either. it's passable. and most of the acting is, though slow, ok. cameron mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character. i guess the best quality of this film, from my perspective, is its fashion sense. the martians have very nice outfits! if this film had a point, it might have been much more interesting. oh well.

this movie is poorly written, hard-to-follow, and features bad performances and dialog from leads jason patric and jennifer jason leigh. the premise, believable but weak (undercover narcotics agent succumbs to the drug underworld) deserved better than this lili fini zanuck flop. the competent supporting cast (sam elliott, william sadler, others) was not enough to save this film.in addition, this movie also contains the absolute worst "love" scene in cinema.moreover, the soundtrack is vastly overrated; specifically the revolting, sappy-without-substance "tears in heaven" by the otherwise legendary eric clapton."rush" is wholly unenjoyable from beginning to end.2 of 10

the performances rate better than the rating i've given this work, simply because i will not support a movie which shows any child or mentally challenged person how to obtain, cook, and inject narcotics into their bodies.this is a disgusting film, which serves no purpose in the world, but to glamorize and attempt to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. it bears convincing performances, which add to my disgust. what were these people thinking?! i could not enjoy a movie such as this. it's enough to make someone who has never done drugs, think about it, and those who have and have redeemed themselves, consider reversion. i'm surprised it doesn't make every clean junkie who sees it, fall off the wagon.there's nothing good about this "movie," which stands more as a how to get strung out docu-drama. this is the epitome of what's wrong with hollywood.utterly disgusting.it rates a 1.3/10 from...the fiend :.

i preface by stating i am a big fan of jjl and not one of patrick. therefore i watched this to see her performance and of course, it was excellent. i do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles, blocking, etc. if the director was trying to give it a "realistic" feel, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. nearly always felt that the camera was way too static, too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters, the dialog was slow and plodding. this easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. but the impression i got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! i also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was... used up.

i don't care what anyone says, this movie was crap. the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done. as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk about...it sucked too. yes it was honest and true to life, but so what, i can hear anyone talk like that on the street, or in a fast food joint. what made the dialogue good in movies like pulp fiction, and gosford park was the fact that it is written dialogue, that takes time to think through. another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture. i believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger, but instead it seemed weak. in fact the movie seemed to revolve around the male character, and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes. the girl in the film i found completely repulsive, not in appearance, but in her needy needy ways. saying she is in love with a guy, and actually getting jealous of him the next day, what a crock of crap. final thing: the sound was terrible, and i hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film. there was a constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on. the one good thing again was blood's job as the dp, but the actress that played the main guy's ex girlfriend did a very good job as well. these two things couldn't save an ultimately terrible movie, which i refuse to call a film. 2/10

yes pigeon and coburn are great, and it's interesting to watch them, although coburn seems rather restrained and dull here. it's enjoyable to view seattle, victoria and salt lake city of 1970's, and the period cars and clothing. that's all the good in this boring film. the dialog is incredibly bad, as is most of the acting. ray and sandy's motivations seem forced and unlikely. i've seen this "training to be a pickpocket" routine several times before. there's a long build up, leading to nothing. better to catch an episode of "streets of san francisco", or one of the many great crime/caper movies. to name a few, there are bedtime story, remade as dirty rotten scoundrels, the lavender hill mob, the grifters, paper moon, the sting, and best of all, house of games.

a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow) and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo. even the squibs look awful. at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america. three wonky old cars do not a country make.the mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel. the plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing. it couldn't come soon enough. even the jewellery from the robbery looks like the cheapest junk costume jewellery available. the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time. worth watching if you want to know how not to make a clich√©-ridden low budget movie.

harrison ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller. the perfect ingredients it seems for top entertainment with harrison back to his indy and han solo best, protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers. how easy it is to be fooled. if the film concentrated on the main, supposed, themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up barns and shoving ice creams in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile. unbelieveably predictable with the best method of despatching of a foe is with corn.

this movie was not that good at all. here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie, harrison ford's name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title. the music was nominated for an oscar, what the heck was that? that music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. the acting was sub par at best, except the amish boy he did a decent job for being so young. then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place, and it won for adapted! the music was horrid, i know i already said something but it was really bad. the premises was real good and it should be remade. well that's all i really have on that.your average movie guy,-trever

the plot in petites coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded.***spoiler***in the space of 48hrs or so, auteuil's character has an affair with a teenager, loses his wife's affections, attempts to seduce scott thomas, is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble.***end of spoiler***wha ???the only saving grace in this flick is kristin scott thomas. similar to charlotte rampling, she seems a *natural* to star in french cinema. my hope is that one day fran√ßois ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent.there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel chabert begging for a dvd release, yet this is the tripe that gets chosen.avoid this one.zzzz..

the distribution was good, the subject could have been interessant and comic. whereas, he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving sensations. instead of this, the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy.

the obsession of 'signifie' and 'signifiant' is not enough to make a good film. pascal bonitzer should have remained in our memory as a brilliant film theorist back in the '60¬¥s. it was not necessary to take the camera. the result is quite frustrating. it¬¥s a pity for his excellent leading actors.

i happened to see this film on a flight from paris to boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and obscure. the french cinema seems to have lost its footing these days and this is a good example of how a motley script can waste brilliant actors. while some may find the 'playfulness' of the script to be in line with the dictates of euro post modernism, the whole project seems more like a post-mortem on the death of euro-cinema's golden years and truly fabulous talents --- one is vaguely reminded here of bunuel but without the charm or wit.

daniel auteuil's bruno in petites couperes is a middle-aged model of his pierre in christian vincent's la separation of 10 years ago. in both films, youthful confidence in left-wing ideology and love (mutual metaphors) crumbles into paranoia - manifesting itself as trapped aggression in pierre and desperately comic womanizing in the more recent bruno.unfortunately for auteuil fans, the actor has become reliant on a uniform world-weariness (not unlike compatriot johnny hallyday in leconte's recent l'homme du train). acting it ain't, and becomes rather frustrating as the film progresses. pascal bonitzer doesn't help as the writer/director of the project. his sequencing of episodes overlaid with connecting symbolism fail to mask the film's lack of rhythm. i was particularly furious that the imposingly dramatic/romantic backdrops of grenoble were made virtually redundant by a cameraman who was obviously shivering in the cold.krisitn scott thomas almost rescues the show with her female counterpart to bruno, beatrice. she dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal. bonitzer cannot sustain this though, and the flagging plot demands beatrice to even out into another bourgeois mannequin. in doing so bonitzer shows then denies scott thomas the oscar cabinet.all the characters' submersion into the bourgeoisie may be a viable and indeed tragic outcome, but in this case it's a cop-out of a cadence (unlike the brutal, painful denouement of la separation). a serious disappointment, 4/10.

good idea....shame about the actual movie. would of liked it to be a bit more scary, and explain more about the characters and who exactly the evil woman was? if she was torturing those kids why were they helping her kill and not helping others kill her?? its a bit of a come down from malcolm in the middle!i think it would of benefited from being slightly longer and going into more detail with the characters, although after about an hour i was wondering when it would end!!would of been better too if the actual characters that killed them were not computerise in reality, it sort of made them crap looking. and what happened to the frankie munitz character? he fell into a bed of wild roses so should of been safe, however the computer game showed him as game over, ie dead. next thing he appears with that irritating blonde lass to rescue the guy afraid of fire who, i noticed, had no qualms about flipping the lighter when demon lady was after him!!too many inconsistencies in this movie to really enjoy it, however, might make you think twice about playing that new computer game!!

seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie you have to see this one i guess. it contains all the " scary parts where nothing happens ", " the nerd type who actually isn't killed", " boy and girl coming together and surviving", "facing an old child-fear" etc... i can go on. i wanted to see this movie cause i tought the mix of a video game and a movie would work out. guess i was wrong. which makes the movie more bearable? it is only 1hour17min so if you are bored it might be a good idea although i rather stay bored. why absolutely not see it? frankie munitz aka malcolm is just irritating as the nerd-type. i could smack the guy and it is so sad he didn't die earlier and in the end he even comes back. see something else!

stay alive is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game. the friends that play this game soon figure this out, and then realise they must defeat the blood countess from the video game or accept their fates. we've had video tapes in the ring, a deadly website in feardotcom. now it's onto video games. stay alive does some things well; the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie. we really see into some of the characters feelings and past and get to know them all quite well, so the audience may gain some emotions for them. the film is also very suspenseful. tense, unnerving moments are frequently played through the film, accompanied by unsettling, creepy music. there are plenty of jumps and jolts for the viewer. this can be ideal once or twice, but these false scares that hollywood seems to enjoy overplaying in horror films nowadays, wears thin in stay alive. the camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes in order to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen. why? the gore is obviously very weak because of the film's certificate. the script to stay alive is very cheesy and quite laughable, and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly. also, clich√©s come in from every direction, for instance people wandering around on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a figure in the dark, they will go and investigate it. however the computer graphics used for the video game segments are rather impressive and look colourful and sharp, working well with the other parts of the film. but overall, there is just not enough to hold out on with this film. stretching at just over a hundred minutes, it won't be a battle to stay alive, but rather, stay awake.

honestly, i was a big fan on 'stay alive' trailer when it got released even some months before. i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot - and perhaps a good one. anyway - this movie is somewhat below my expectations.the plot has a great potential, but how the story unfolds, along with the acting , directing and bad cgi - this film is a disaster. the ghost doesn't make any sense, and including the killings - its all just too hurried, creating a sense of 'unrealistic' in the audience's mind.this film could be scary for some audiences - but fear in a sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc) rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the movie.you should re-consider watching this movie.

stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, i am called the attention it was the trailer and not the cartel.the topic of the movie centred on a video i play that was created by a countess to kill the people and to live eternally is acceptable.first that quite, bad movie of horror, the blood sees more or less sparked(spread gossip), these scenes is bled they are the more bad.but actually(indeed) that bad is this movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all the aspects.i do not recommend this movie to anybody, trailer well, movie bad.i do not deal since(as,like) they spend(consume) money and time doing these senseless movies and too bad.

a mediocre at best horror flick that deals with dumb, not so horny teens who discover an evil video game (gasp) is killing those who die in the game (double gasp). this movie is the sustained mystery of the mystery gang in "scooby doo". i was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains. i could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci-fi but going all the way to the theaters, come on people. the effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something of crummy two-but director uwe boll, since this would be his cast. as always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button. i'd suggest using that mid-viewing. *1/2

recension: angels & demonsthe movie is directed by ron howard. he has had also made famous movies like the da vinci code & cinderella men. he directed also the famous tv-series 24. the most famous actors are tom hanks(the da vinci code,the green mile, forrest gump,¬Ö) & ewan mcgregor(cassandra's dream, moulin rouge, star wars: the phantom menace,¬Ö).in the begin i was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. because they changed the father of vittoria vettra(ayelet zurer) in someone else, silvano bentivoglio(camren argenziano). another change is that robert langdon(tom hanks) never goes to the cern. it was nice that they could film on location in the cern.then movie goes on, they are spectacular car races in rome. an i also like the part in chirstian archives very much when they destroy the work of galileo, it was funny. it was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, robert langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get on¬Öi found it very stupid that robert langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the camerlengo(ewan mcgregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. in the book he is the real son of the pope.when i should give the best acting performance then i should say pierfrancesco favino who plays inspector olivetti. the worst acting was from the assassin, who was played by nikolaj lie kaas, i think he was underachieving, because in adams apples he played faboulous.i think the whole movie is underachieving because director ron howard made some many stupid changes. i would rate the movie by 4/10.

i'm a historian. this movie is so wrong it hurts. tried to watch with an open mind, but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history, locations, church protocol, et cetera. stop playing to the dumb audience, please. there are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. a little research, all i'm asking. but then again, the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. so basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. i know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects¬Ö or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.

firstly i loved the book, more so than the more popular da vinci code and although the dvc film was not well received, i liked it and bought the dvd. however, there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again.the film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there.from the very start of the film i was disappointed, in the book robert langdon receives a call and fax from maximilian kohler, director of cern. who finds the body of father (can't remember the name) and then requests langdon to come, using the super fast plane... in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... in the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on, when the camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been maximilian kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and olivetti was shot... (err i think i got this right, but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the film)...there was no love interest between vittoria and robert and in the book she wasn't at cern when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. in the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. in the book vittoria was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the camerlingo. the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm. ok in the book we are led to believe that langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... there was no mention of how vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of vittoria.in all one of the worse films i have seen, i would have left early, but my brain went numb and i lost the use of my legs temporarily. a really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of ron howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! i want my money back!!!

ron howard and his "editors" only had one job to do... follow the guidelines of the book which was "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and highly cinematic in its approach! what they did? they changed everything and i mean everything! what is left is something that has no right being called "angels & daemons"! i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for "this" film.i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless.......

the implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble fr mckenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. mckenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. and, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. i have always used independence day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (us president commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. for such an implausible film, angels and demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the volkswagen? i felt like shouting, "you are going to be blown up". who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? who didn't spot the baddie? technically also, the film was awful. the dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. moreover, many scenes looked like mud. the one redeeming feature was the shots of rome and what looked like the vatican -- an achievement, because i am sure that the vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around st peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. rome is a magic place, and i enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.

why did they not follow the book ... i am really sad and disappointed. i was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. my wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.reasons for the disappointment are: 1) cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that vittoria's father was burned with the first illuminati brand, which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie_ 2) story-line between the (deceased) pope and camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) story-line between langdon and vittoria vetra completely non-existentall-in-all, too flaky storyline, and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it. maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time, when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid)really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations

i went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book. there were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the divinci code. i went to see the divinci code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. it was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. unfortunately, angels and demons disappointed on almost every level. throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. they blow past the various immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. the final illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. in my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the langdon character is all about. overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10

personally, the book was a very well written, amazing, thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me, seeing that it affected the "different" outcome of the movie. there was something to be desired out of this movie, but all in all, it lacked in plot.for someone who has not read the book, i could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, i did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.with major characters missing (such as maximilian kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. the hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the illuminati, however, in the movie, his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand.

it is difficult to imagine how the engaging dan brown novel "angels and demons" could misfire as badly as this film version. here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. due to the spoilers, please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.(1) in the film, there was no love relationship between robert langdon and vittoria vetra. worse still, there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. (2) the breathtaking locations in rome, as described in the novel, were not realized visually in the film. i am aware that director ron howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. but there are superior photographed depictions of rome on the history channel than in this film where the eternal city was presented in eternal stock film footage. the great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. the magnificent bernini sculpture of the "ecstasy of st. teresa" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the west ponente relief in vatican square was not visible at all.(3) the most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved john paul ii. in the novel, the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.(4) one of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, maximilian kohler, director of cern, was cut out of the screenplay.(5) there were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.(6) there were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. this technique worked in "the godfather" films, but ron howard is no gordon willis.(7) the college of cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a southern drawl. this dude would have been more at home on a texas ranch than in the sistine chapel.(8) the crucial relationship of the camerlengo and the deceased pope was not defined in the film. this relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the illuminati to the plot against the church.(9) in the novel, the character of hassassin was an unforgettable villain. in the film, that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. (10) as a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.in the novel, langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the tiber river. in ron howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the tiber.

i'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie, it couldn't happen fast enough. just to end the movie. i don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. it fooled me into a bad night.

i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another. not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end (actually i can't believe we watched it to the end) but i think it is because we couldn't quite believe it.

some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting; but it is indeed far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement.the source from which all the problems stem; the story. aside from one of them people being shot point blank, with a shotgun, in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. nic, the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and that includes asking an evil spirit for help. ce-ce, who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo, is willing to summon killjoy, so long as nic can "hook her up." the acting, while improved, is still horrid. these people couldn't convey emotion out of a paper bag. the script doesn't help them either. stupid lines, and i can only assume no direction from the director. this script was read like shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went.while this movie (if you can call it that at its 80 min. run time (thankfully)) is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.

there is a fantastic song in killjoy 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer. i don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer olimpia fernandez sings 'killjoy, yeah killjoy 2' is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel. the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. this time the cast, including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film. full moon pictures produced this during their 'urban' phase, none of which was very good but none so bad as here.

it would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch killjoy 2, you must have better things to do, washing the car, throwing stones in a stream, but at the same time it's nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is. it's almost a proper film, which a lot more than most straight-to-dvd sludge can manage. killjoy 2 is helped a great deal by trent haaga's manic turn as the eponymous clown, he throws himself into the role with such fevered abandonment that he almost tips the scales in the movie's favour, but, of course, it takes more than one man in big shoes. tammi sutton gives the most entertaining director cameo since roger corman in creature from the haunted sea and the whole thing is nearly destroyed by the rushed, sugary ending. all over the place and almost good fun.

i have never seen the first killjoy film, and i have also never heard a good thing said about it. so i see killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. starring trent haaga and debbie rochon it boasts. now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out, how can it possibly be bad with these two init? oh how wrong i was. even trent and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is. trent quite frankly stinks as killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one-liners in the history of film. debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough. the kills are terrible as are the gore effects. for example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other. and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history. the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level. avoid like the clap.2/10

one day i thought to myself....what is the worst possible thing that could happen today? i answered my self with a simple," oh, it already happened. i rented killjoy/killjoy 2" on dvd. well, what is there to say? the budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform, the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. there is one funny line that i can remember, and the acting is far worse than the first one. there seems to be no lighting on the "set" (the woods somewhere) and the killer clown known as killjoy (who makes leprechaun look like the exorcist)is less than spectacular. this time, he is not portrayed by angel vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says "child" a lot. somewhere between freddy krueger and a blade of grass... lies this version of killjoy. somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s---t lies killjoy 2. it's badness is underrated. this movie does not have any redeeming qualities, except the song at the very end over the credits... which at leas provides some enjoyment. killjoy 2 is not even really a movie, so much as an exercise in tension. killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie i have ever seen. minor spoiler######### let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. a girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort (maybe an outhouse?) when killjoy peers in through a hole. he has some small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at spencer's gifts) and he does something with them (maybe winds them up?!). then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on imdb). from what i gather of this scene (not from what is shown by the movie) the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in some interesting, but unshown way, and then came back to killjoy. if i were those teeth i would have run. run far from killjoy so he could never ever get his hands on me again. killjoy 2 is hopefully the last killjoy we will have to endure. even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad, i think that this "film" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed. i give it 2/10 - simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move.

killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. honestly, i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie. the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. they didn't. this movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. that clown.... that goddamn clown.... i hate him! i hate him so much! and i don't hate him because he is a good villain... i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief! i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable. the last thing we need is a killjoy 3.

i really don't know why i agreed to watch this movie, but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot! i had seen the original killjoy, well i say i have seen it.... i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in 4x speed.to cut a long story short killjoy 2 kicks off where killjoy left off. by this i don't mean the plot, i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness. i have nothing against low budget movies, in fact i kinda enjoy them, they are something different from mega budget blockbusters, but this film is just terrible! the acting is diabolical and the script... well i think you could of given stevie wonder a pen and paper, and he would of produced something much better! this movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed! i didn't make it through this movie anyway, about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain! please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this muck, it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the muck i've seen thats saying a lot! my rating on this movie would be.... nailgun to the head/10

cops logan alexander and debbie rochon escort five black juvenile delinquents cross country and end up stranded out in the sticks when their van breaks down. after a deadly run-in with a racist, white trash bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. one of the teens senselessly uses a spell to call up killjoy, who finally shows up about midway through this bore in a subpar make-up job and bigger, greasier 'fro that looks like it could slide off his head at any moment. he then proceeds to kill off the stupid characters while spouting some of the worst one-liners heard since hee haw was canceled.the acting from the "teens" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the fx stink and it looks a lot cheaper than the first film. although i enjoyed him in his earlier troma films, trent haaga (trying to imitate jim carrey here) is awful and no match for the hyperactive overemoting of angel vargas in killjoy 1 (which at least had a few dumb laughs).yet another nail in the coffin for full moon studios, whose reputation as a fun direct-to-vid franchise has completely vanished since the trancers/puppet master days.

chuck norris stars as danny, a cop who took down a hulking serial killer however when said killer escapes, danny knows he is the only one able to stop the terror. however danny harbors a secret, he knows that it was sheer luck that got the terror arrested and even more luck that danny survived, now a final battle is waged but is danny ready? right there in my description tells what the problem of this movie is. norris is playing a wimpy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. in the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller. in the hands of a norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. also on board is american ninja's steve james and superfly's ron o'neal but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script. also there is hardly any action and i always preferred a norris movie with more fighting and less talking. given the rating on this website, i must not be alone.* out of 4-(bad)

this film could cure sleep disorders, thats how bad it is. the story dragged, and the bad guy is not that scary. you will not even see this one on tbs reruns. this film made me wonder about chuck film choices. he work on a real dog with this one.

this was painful. i made myself watch it until the end, even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot, if there was one. my patience was not rewarded. the ending was even worse than the rest of the film. chucky walks into the hospital with a priest and his concubine says "i do". how vile can one movie be?

well, the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion. yes, chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job. like my friend ryan, i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend. until than, the killer had only killed women. oh, well, i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought. definitly a film you can pass on.

for a norris movie this is pretty tame. for an action movie it is kind of dull, and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed. it was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80's action movies, but come on, the only non-predictable move defies the plot and the set-up of the editing. mainly, it is said rather early on that the killer (jack o'halloran, whom is one of the few slightly known actors) only kills women. yet, he all of a sudden stops his m.o. and kills men, huh?. i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way, but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women?? yet again, i'm sure that there is a reason (i.e. to build suspense), but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior.fans of "renegade" may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor, but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous.

this is simply another bad chuck norris movie. norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. he put the guy away three years before, but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental floss. then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation. irish jack o'halloran is the best thing in this movie, but like in superman ii, he doesn't say a word. somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing. ron o'neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city's mayor and norris' sidekick respectively. the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 1980's. when coupling norris' "serious" acting turn with over-the-top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion, the film becomes a chore to sit through. the build-up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway, but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way. it's yet another disappointment from cannon films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.

"hero and the terror" is a fairly dull thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable plot, and... boring. for a thriller i found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax, as it just seemed to drag along until chuck's wife's baby is born... and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end - which i can hardly remember already even though i only saw the film 10 minutes ago.i give this film 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes.

i picked this film up from the local family video on sale for $1.50, which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good. watching it with 2 friends, neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is. i, strangely, couldn't stop watching it. but this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie.the plot is simple enough and sounds great: chuck norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars. the serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more. serial murder, norris, roundhouse kicks... this sounds like a great film.and some of it is pretty good. the flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a van cascades off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing -- and i learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than chapstick, gun powder and dental floss. but there is plenty wrong with this movie.one: the editor is a moron. when making an action or suspense film, you have to keep the energy moving. there are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie, slowing it down and distracting from the overall story. at least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better. two: the sound guy is a moron. apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound, so most of the dialog is voiced over, killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths. also, the music is far too dramatic in some scenes. three: the casting director is a moron. they cast billy drago as a psychiatrist. billy drago is a great cult actor (from brisco county, the hills have eyes, and others) and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain. his character is so vanilla that drago's skills are wasted. four: the writer is a moron. two plots are in this film - the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between norris and his pregnant girlfriend. every time i saw that woman on screen, i wanted to claw my eyes out. and sure enough, she never figured into the other plot, making her story completely pointless.will i ever watch this again? maybe. but unless they remaster this film at least a dozen times, you never should. not recommended.

when i was young, i was a big fan of chuck norris. i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes. i remember that i really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best. now that i'm a little older, i can say that although it's thoroughly average, i still consider it one of his better films. in an acting stretch for him, norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. serial killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention. in contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies (as well as stalk n' slashers) of 70s and 80s. while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham-fisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck. being a big fan of steve james also, i can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend billy drago, as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role. not great, but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s.

if anyone at national lampoon is reading this please stop the crap your pulling out of your bum, really now! why the hell are you doing movies like these? they're not funny and watching it for the sexual content is a complete waste of time, really. it is such a horrible movie you may want to shoot yourself while your watching it. i am serious here, guys, it makes harol and kumar go to blah blah blah look like an actual good movie (and we all know that h&k is one of the worst movies ever made) it really sucks, it really does. how bad it is? well, even losers that actually like national lampoon shall hate this movie...they'll want to murder the director, i swear to god. i hate you, national lampoon, die already. die.

i love movies in this genre. beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. so why didn't i like this movie? no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. who's who, where is the money, it's not se7en, just make me laugh. maybe it's me, but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon's movies. this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling, waiting for what's next. instead, i find myself stopping to think, "why did they keep that scene?" i do not recommend this movie. if you are expecting van wilder, think again. the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generously.

this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie. it had a dude from "detroit rock city", a girl from "the cosby show", that dork that kissed the chick and bought that sausage was in "sorority boys" and there was more. ok that doesn't make a bad movie in itself, that was just something i noticed. the whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up.....shocking enough.......you called it. and the purse thing, that was just plain stupid. it was so bad that i watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark. if you are watching this and expect "van wilder" or a movie like that......don't.

this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen. the only concessions is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on dvd from the video store. simply - no plot worth mentioning (i only watched it 5 minutes ago and already i have forgotten), annoying characters played poorly by two-bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy i am still waiting to laugh. in fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was truly awful.put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and i warn others to not waste their time. a travesty of the national lampoon name , rating 0/10.

look at the all the positive user comments of this movie, then check to see how often each one posts user comments. they post once. it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro-movie comments on imdb.this movie was awful. the plot was stupid. the acting was poor. the jokes weren't even funny. the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters.it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny. there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and spreading rumors. this isn't even done well. every joke is obvious and you see it coming.the movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching.i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and distributor for 1.5 hrs they stole from me i would.

a stupid teen supposed comedy that revolves a serious of misunderstanding including (but not limited to) a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student, girlfriend beating, a girl loving a gay guy, and the straight guy that loves her, and bitchy gossipers. none of the following is funny or even amusing. nation lampoon's use to be hilarious back in the day. now the name is sadly synonymous with crap. and this one is no exception. i use to think topenga was kinda cute when she was on "boy meets world", but it seems she let herself go (and yes i know she has a name, but into she does anything else worthwhile, she'll stay as topenga) my grade: deye candy: kati lohmann gets topless; boti bliss relies on a body double (booooo!!!)

when i decided to try watching a movie about cryogenic zombies ("cryonoids"), i wasn't expecting a whole lot. that's exactly what i got, and then even less. aside from a shortage of special effects (squibs?) and a severe lack of any acting talent, "the chilling" also sports the absolute worst script i've ever seen made into a movie. i had to stop the tape numerous times during the first 45 minutes in order to repair the damage done to my intellect for witnessing such atrocious dialogue as there is found here.furthermore, the collection of characters is so formulaic and one-dimensional it's ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by linda blair (we know she's his "assistant" because he repeatedly refers to her by that title); the recently-widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with blair's character; his criminal son; the blair character's alcoholic, abusive, unemployed boyfriend, whom we are introduced to in the most contrived use of a flashback; and, of course, the rough, tough, bearded security guard who becomes the hero.apparently, the preserving fluid which some cryogenics lab uses on its bodies is highly conductive, naturally resulting in disaster when all of the lab's containers end up outdoors in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm (on halloween night, no less). as for the zombies themselves, if you enjoy watching people in green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil suits, then "the chilling" is the movie for you. the zombie action is very weak at its best; the zombies' primary killing method seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death. the businessman and the security guard do most of the zombie fighting, including a highly suspenseful scene of re-freezing the undead with liquid nitrogen. let me tell you, the steel mill scene in "t2" has got nothing on "the chilling" in portraying an enemy getting frozen in his tracks like that.how linda blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery. true, her career didn't exactly skyrocket during the 80s (sadly), but this movie is an embarrassment for her. the script doesn't even have the decency to put her to any good use. the most that her character is given to do is shriek out things like "here they come", "do something", "hurry!". the only thing i can figure is that poor linda was compensated for her work on this film in rations of food. the hero is played by grizzly adams himself, dan haggerty. in this picture, he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog, and he does his best to outperform them both.the only frightening part of "the chilling" is the introduction which brings up the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the film you are about to see could happen in your own community". as i was counting the number of times a few of the names are repeated in the closing credits, i was floored to suddenly see lucasfilm get credited. fortunately, it was only for the movie's sound production. 1/10.

the combination of dan haggerty (elves) and linda blair (exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie. and once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you'll think you were in b-movie horror heaven. at least that's the way i approached this film. but boy, was i in for a shocki love horror movies. i love b-movies as well. nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. but to say that this movie was lacking, is an understatement. this movie was pure trash. you'd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover-art of the box displays, but instead, you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any halloween display counter. furthermore, the script is beyond pitiful. our main character, joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm-hearted mary, played by blair. not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of joseph's character. instead, we see the head of the cryogenic labs, a man named dr. miller, eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs. there is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film.all and all, very disappointing. all the elements to make a great horror film were there. you had your zombies, your decent actors, and your story. but the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up royally. overall, 4 out of 10

this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen. i tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that pertain to this film! cheap dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough story to pull you in, no action apart from some really cheap scenes. it seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other "hey this looks rather cool, why not put this in there" after which the director probably said "yeah....yeah this is genius!" and got back to snorting coke or something. when it comes to acting i think the only person that tried to make the movie worked is daan schuurmans but in the end it is all for nothing. cause this movie sucks!! 2/10

if you like soap-series, you might like this film. i recommend this film to fans of dutch soap-series like gtst, westenwind or even american stuff like the bold & the beautiful. if you don't like that stuff: stay away from this movie. it has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, direction and writing.the film was a big hit at home territory, but wasn't sold anywhere else outside holland and belgium. pretty strange for a commercial film like this.maybe it says something....

proud as i am of being a dutchman, i'm truly shocked by flicks like these. why? why this cheap acting? why this storyline that just sucks? why a dozen sequels? why o why? they add a lot of hot dutch chicks in an effort of saving this movie from redemption, and guess what? all the underaged breezergirlies in holland go and see it. i was forced to watch it at a party. all the girls were going crazy when daan schuurmans entered the screen, all the guys took a another beer and grumbled... but the thing that really bothers me, is the fact that this kind of flicks are the only sort of movies dutch filmmakers can produce... (apart from "van god los" and "lek") this doesn't prove our superiority to other countries.. it doesn't add anything to our imagination... it just f**ks up the brains of little 13 year old girls... johan nijenhuis, i hope you will burn forever!

ok let's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad, it's really bad. rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along(lek, karakter) here in holland but not often. costa! is about 4 girls going to spain to go on vacation, party, get drunk, get laid (u know the drill). it's also about the world of clubbers or proppers. pro's who're trying to lure the crowd into their club.i'm not sure how long it took to write the script, but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long. nothing, and i mean nothing is believable in this movie. it's almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline. suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing. with a one-on-one fight with 'the bad guy in black' and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car (can it be more cheesy). also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers.after having seen "traffic" 3 days before this, i fell from sheer brilliance, from a piece of art to this. this is film-making at it's saddest. and don't start about low budget. because even with a low budget you could write a better script. it almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie.anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit, but for the rest of it, don't waste your money on such garbage.

this might very well be the worst movie i've seen in my life. normally i don't watch movies like this, however i was forced to watch this at school. what a torment!the story is as average and boring as it can be: boy meets girl at the spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love. at the end of the movie the film becomes some kind of weird kung-fu movie were the guys in white fight the guys in black. awful!the action is so bad that it makes you laugh. the dances in the film that i think are supposed to be cool are so simple and laughable that even i can do them! and georgina verbaan is possibly the most irritating person i've ever seen on screen.johan nijenhuis is on his way of becoming the dutch ed wood. his movies are so bad that they make you laugh.victor l√∂w however gives a surprising good performance and daan schuurmans also acts ok.so please for your own sake don't watch this movie. however if you like watching soaps this might be very well worth your time.yuk!2/10

firetrap is yet again another bad action film about a guy who- yada yada yada- and happy endings and fire, and burning, and overacting, and bad suspense, and predictable, and ------------------- just don't see.(dean cain got stuck playing superman on lois and clark and can't get any good roles anymore. so i don't know if he is a good or bad actor.this isn't good.why can't anybody stop that bad people who keep making these things? ai swear they just s*** them out on a conveyor belt and hope they are good. they need to make a guy whose job is to just burn the movies that look bad, just have a bucket of carosine next to him and dump the cases in. then at the end of each day light it and go home.

dean cain, the one time super-man, plays max hooper the super-thief. he can break into any company and steal any thing for the right price. unfortunately his latest heist ends him up in a high-rise in which someone else has set a fire to hide their own attempts to steal the product. now the thief finds himself having to be the hero rescuing everyone in the building. unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the f.b.i. & c.i.a. are outside waiting for max.the movie is barely passable. dean cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material but here he is saddled with a weak script and pretty poor direction.

this film was so bad it became enjoyable. if you want to see a soap opera cast decide to do an action film, this is for you! overacting, irrelevant incidents, implausible dialogue - it has it all. the main character has a split personality and can not make up his mind whether he is thief, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. he is plausible in none of these roles. this sets the standard for many of the other characters. the boss of the company whose building is set ablaze displays the same unpredictability, and so does his wife. and the punch line - who has taken the "chip" - beggars belief. i found myself laughing heartily and for that reason, i recommend you watch it.

another stinker from the pm entertainment group, and thankfully one of their last.'firetrap' is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'the towering inferno' i don't mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them - there is no effort whatsoever in 'firetrap' is stars dean'superman'cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here and that's saying something, the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps. the special fx are just rubbish, shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst i've ever seen, the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera. on top of that there is not one character you actually root for - you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up.the script is embarrassing - the red herring's are signposted well in advance, someone else has mentioned this but 'the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire engulfing the building with his broom....hilarious, or same janitor going into a room marked 'hazardous material', were these scenes supposed to be tongue-in-cheek? somehow i doubt itthe one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention, but so little care was given to everything in the film, i can't recommend it - watch 'the towering inferno' instead3/10

i am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decent...much less great! do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch? i just don't know anymore.this "commercial cinematic product" doesn't really deserve the respect of being called a film. to call dean cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent. i have had a lot of respect for lori petty but most of that has gone right down the tubes. at least her role was extremely small. maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paid.the ignorance i saw while viewing "firetrap" was amazing. let me start out by getting this off my chest: if you can't show fire realistically then don't show it at all. okay?!! it's an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that don't even come close to simulating an actual burning building.some interesting tidbits: 1. a janitor opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames. what does he do? he tries to put out the fire with his broom! 2. the same janitor (who knows the building is on fire) later comes across a door marked "hazardous materials". his brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door. big mistake! 3. a woman is giving a fantastically generous donation of $100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund but...she's wearing a fur coat to the charity event they're holding! (wouldn't people who care about animals kinda frown on that sort of thing?) 4. several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse(!!) couldn't penetrate. yet they have a spacious air vent leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through. that sure seems like a lapse in security.i could go on and on but i have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie. our "hero" whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers. what a swell guy! if the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them. i just wish i could have it erased from my memory. 1/10

ugghhh!!! this is exactly the sort of pre-code film that could incorrectly convince the viewer that films from this time period are lousy--and they are not--it's just that this particular film is horrid. horrid because while the film tries very hard to be "hip" and "adult", it also is so hopelessly old fashioned, dull and hokey that i was torn between laughing at the film or just falling asleep!! this is a unique combination, to say the least.so why, exactly, did i hate it so much? well, the film is incredibly sleazy but has no style and the film is meant to shock but lacks subtlety and takes too many ridiculous turns to be believable. the film begins with a clich√©--a hooker with a heart of gold. dorothy mackaill is a prostitute and she appears to accidentally kill a man! shortly after making her escape, she meets up with an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her (he doesn't realize her profession). seeing this man's innate goodness, she determines to change her life and stop living the wild life. this is tough when she hides out on a fictional caribbean island. here, alone and waiting for her man to return, there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super-horny and totally unappealing men. in fact this portion of the movie is so dull, that the audience might have a hard time staying focused. the men on the island are so inflamed by the presence of mackaill that they perpetually seem on the verge of raping her--only to be rebuffed because she isn't that sort of girl any more. frankly, i got very tired of all these salacious scenes--there is simply too much eye rolling and tongue-wagging to make it seem anything other than a very bad film. and looking at all these ugly horn-dogs was just annoying and stupid.but wait,...it gets a lot worse. the man she thought she killed shows up on this tiny island (what are the odds?!) and he tries to rape her as well. however, he's not to be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save her new-found virtue. while the jury on the island is about to acquit her, she rushes back into court and lies--telling them she meant to kill the man and it was premeditated (?) because even if she's acquitted, she knows the evil jailer will have his way with her when she is sent to jail for a gun possession charge. given that the jailer himself gave her the gun to set her up, her rushing into the court and saying she was guilty seemed really, really silly. why didn't she just tell them the jailer's twisted plan?! supposedly she did this in order to preserve her virtue but to admit to killing someone so people will think you are a virgin?! so, in order to avoid a short jail sentence (and, once again, the threat of rape), she doesn't consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the jailer has promised to rape her when she is locked up). and, just before she is taken to the gallows (in order to avoid the rape), the boyfriend shows up in time for her to send him off and the credits roll.impossible situation and coincidences abound--coming so often that the film is just dumb. combining this with all the sexual innuendo, this makes for a bad and sleazy mess of a film which will only appeal to the most die-hard fans of pre-code films. all others, beware, this is very sticky and silly from start to finish!

the comments for commune make it sound like a very interesting film, one that i would be deeply interested in. unfortunately, the producers didn't see fit to include closed captions for the hearing impaired and deaf. that leaves me and countless others like me, who depend on closed captions to follow a movie, completely out. this is inexcusable for any film produced in the year 2005. in a world where all manner of handicaps and disabilities are accommodated, it's infuriating and ironic that the ever sanctimonious entertainment industry fails to demand that all productions and movie theaters be closed captioned.

this old stinker makes the flash gordon movies look sophisticated. it's so terrible i love it, and i wish i could find a tape, but none of the catalogs i've checked list it. the rock band leader who calls himself commander cody must have loved it too, because he named his band after it.

i guess if you like watching dudes get "pumped up" to outrageous sizes,this is right up your alley.otherwise,it's an exercise in ego. i don't need to do either.anyhoo,it's of historic interest,i guess,to see how these muscle positive and brain negative chumps got that way(before/after/and in between steroids)-but otherwise,this isn't going to influence many guys and,as for women,well,i'm not one so i can't say....

this is an old-dark-house movie. a young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by satan, where they run from and into one after another of an ill-assorted crew: a lady in distress, an ape, an ape-man, a midget, various odd-looking people, and (for some reason) two chinese. they end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a "price is right" sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. for my taste it's too much of the same thing. the creeping around fun-house corridors is amusing for a while, then becomes repetitive. by comparison with harold lloyd or buster keaton or laurel and hardy doing the same bit in two reels, it isn't truly funny. it's not frightening either, and apparently wasn't intended to be: the household is too absurd. most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat, and usually two--one that the characters are led to believe is real, and another for which it's a cover. here the cover isn't to be taken seriously, and neither is what covered. a few moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it's rather heavy fun. the novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and i think could have been played straight to better effect--and still could be.

i usually love teen/high school genre flicks, but this film was really lacking in originality. the only premise this film has is four friends cheating their way through high school and the strain it puts on their friendship. there's just not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep the viewers attention for the full length of the film. the acting isn't all that bad although the actors don't really have much to work with as the dialog is tripe and clich√©'... after watching this movie, one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think, "i must make this film." no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release. andrew gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.

thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film, but was sadly disappointed. this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything. the film also portrayed teachers and the principal, mary tyler moore (mrs. stark),"labor pains",2000 as complete idiots. i know this was suppose to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time! however, all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film! just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!

i figure this to be an "alternate reality" teen flick...more precisely a ferris bueller type character as the leader of a cheat ring . yeah, i know it's not meant to compared to ferris bueller, at least not in a "oranges-to-oranges" way, but it will none-the-less.bottom-line: it's galaxies away from even being even a minor classic. it is watchable, though only if you're not expecting very much. that said, the main character has some charm, but the premise wears thin because the writing just isn't clever. the movie just did not deliver enough laughs, twists, or tension to keep my interest. to be honest i did continue watching...watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked. it didn't. so, stylish as it is, i wouldn't recommend this movie. btw, it seems odd to see mary tyler moore as the principal. she's truly miscast, i hope the paycheck was inordinately big.

so.. what can i tell you about this movie. if you cheated a lot in high school, you do recognize some cheattips...this is the best thing i can tell you about this film!if you like american-teen movies, maybe you also like it!but i don't see this kind of movies as something funny.. sorry to say but if you are older then 10 years, i shouldn't advise you to watch this.because there is one shot with a couple of beautiful women (girls.. in this movie) i'll give it a rate of: 2!so.. deal for yourself! good luck

totally un-funny "jokes" that fall flat, amateurish acting (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogue that's, at best, mediocre. after watching this movie, one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think, "i must make this film." no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release.

i'm generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely stray far from clich√©d story lines and characters and downright dull dialog. however, i've had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when i was still in high school myself. seeing the oh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. these movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in 'cheats', especially not the protagonist. of course, it didn't help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids i've ever seen in a comedy.to act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right or the material goes to waste. in this case there wasn't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast.this movie felt 3 hours long, the director never heard of pacing obviously. stay away from this one, there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as 10 things i hate about you, who's your daddy and superbad.

andrew gurland's "cheats" is his fictionalized "true story" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. the quartet are: supercilious school-hating trevor fehrman (as handsome davis), his likewise good-looking pal matthew lawrence (as victor), their chubby school-hating chum elden henson (as sammy), and crooked geekster martin starr (as applebee). the adults include high-strung north point principal mary tyler moore (as mrs. stark) and pornography-loving father griffin dunne (as mr. davis). the high jinks begin with mr. fehrman and mr. lawrence supposedly urinating on a teacher's grade book. put this one at the bottom of the pile; and, be thankful it doesn't go on anyone's permanent record.*** cheats (2002) andrew gurland ~ trevor fehrman, matthew lawrence, elden henson

i watched cheats a few years ago with my friend. he hyped it up as a great funny film that is one of the best comedies ever. i think he was on crack or something. i just recently learned that this film was not released into theatres, i can understand why perfectly.the basic plot involves a group of guys who cheat on pretty much all of their assignments in school to get good grades. that is the main problem of this film is that the morals are all bad. there are other teen comedy films where students do bad things but it is most often stuff that does not take place at school. so i think that the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids cheating on everything is pretty bad.i did not like the characters in this film either. the main character guy is a completely smug arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. actually i am not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist due to the fact that they all are cheating at school which is wrong. the other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the cast blows in this film.this film has a bad message and even worse acting and characters. there are other teen films that are way better than this film. so you do not have to see this one and that is a good thing because i do not recommend this film at all.

i wouldn't call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness, so i might not be the best audience for this show. although, being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike, this being the later.lack of humor is a big turnoff when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy, cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the badger animation from a couple of years ago (?) this is the exact opposite, with a stiff script and all overacted voice-overs its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to. unfortunately, since it did have a big market ahead of itself, and a lot of potential.a waste of time.

i love oddball animation, i love a lot of asian films, but i didn't love this particular product of japan. the fuccons are supposedly an american family (they're all mannequins) who have moved to japan, and they're somewhat a 50's sitcom type family, with slightly more modern sensibilities at times. the dvd features several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining, not even in a weird way. i'm not sure what the appeal is of this. i did pick up on some satire here and there, gosh, who wouldn't, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, isn't it? and nothing i saw or heard rated even a little smirk. i picked this up used and it certainly sounded appealing, but i guess either i'm missing the point or it's just plain lame. the box even says it's fuccon hilarious, right there on the front, but i beg to differ. 2 out of 10.

the year still has three weeks to go but unless a really horrendous turkey shows up before then, passion of the mind may be the winner of my lousiest movie of the year contest. an interesting idea badly executed. and, for that matter, badly acted. demi moore is very good at curling her lip and smoking cigarettes, but is that all she does? and why so many cigarettes. did ligitt and myers or one of the other bad boys of nicotine have some of their illicit profits invested in this production. it's confusing, silly and moves at the frantic past of a arthritic earthworm. i gave it a 3. should have been a 2!

if you value your life in any way, shape, or form, you will do yourself a courtesy and pass by this seemingly "interesting" movie on the dvd rack.i know what you're thinking, "i saw the preview and it looked great!" however, buyer beware, i fell into the same trap. one of my friends expressed certain reluctance to watching this movie, but i forced her to sit it out. oh, how i regret that decision.like most horror movies, the movie starts out cheerfully in a sunny mexican resort where two couples are lured to an ancient mayan ruin by a fellow resort-goer. upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but oblivious to their greeting shouts. as if this isn't ominous enough, the tour group casts aside large plant growth and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife a perfect route to their destination. i guess it wouldn't be much of a movie if they utilized rational decision making and turned around just then, but, well, this wasn't much of a movie anyways.after some hiking, the sixsome (the resort goer brought a friend) stumble upon the ruins and at once their doubts are dispelled by its beauty and history. that is, until frantic tribal people emerge from the jungle armed with a vengeance for no reason in particular, shouting in an indecipherable language. since when are brutal verbal assaults assuaged by calm, patronizing language - don't ask me - but nonetheless, the cast tries anyway, to no avail, obviously. suddenly, the sixth trail member, dimitri, is punctured with several arrowheads from the mayans and all hell breaks loose. a gunshot finishes the job and the horrified travelers retreat quickly up the ruin.now, if there was ever a plot to this movie, it ended here. the introduction took at most 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie. on top of the ruins, the now fivesome realizes they are stranded by murderous locals and proceed to make countless good decisions, one of them being to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the bowels of the ruin. needless to say, the adventurer is seriously hurt and then trapped within the ruins and the two girlfriends are gravely injured trying to rescue him.the rest of the movie continues plotlessly, with no real horror, only only blood and gore, as displayed when one girl yanks a plant growing within her out, gushing torrents of blood and then again when somebody's legs are cut off, only to have the same plat from within the girl strangle him later.my only satisfactions in this movie were observing the very attractive jonathon tucker, playing jeff mcintire, grow increasingly more frazzled and distressed and sitting long enough to ascertain that almost all of the cast dies a horrible, gruesome death. their simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for the time suck that was this movie.supposedly, the storyline goes that the ruin is an ancient house of of dangerous spirits with an evil, flesh eating plant to ward off and consume unlucky visitors. unfortunately, i got no such warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing relating to this movie that i am truly horrified by is the script writer.

the ruins is to turistas as deep impact was to armageddon, a worse version of a mildly entertaining movie, except much much worse. one of the characters is supposed to be going to medical school, so why are they all retards? "you can't keep cutting." -best line form this movie. this is an awful movie. i like horror movies, but fully appreciate that most of them are terrible, but had a bit of high hopes for this movie after seeing the reviews on imdb. the situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid. it is awful, the one thing that makes it somewhat palatable is its cool australian backdrop, despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the movie in one place.

i have not seen such a stupid,dumb movie since quite a while. it absolutely has no logic, no horror- doesn't scare you, no suspense, not thrilling.. i mean i didn't find even one part of the movie appealing..i don't know what they were thinking when they made the movie.. you watch the whole movie to find out that, there is a plant that can walk around, drag human dead bodies and eat human flesh. not just that but it can also talk i.e. imitate sounds, like a cellphone ringing or human talking... so its like, the plant makes the noise of a cell phone ringing, so they go after the cellphone and find out its a plant... how intelligent of the plant to setup an ambush. this clearly is the creativity level of a primary school kid... bad!!!

it had potential...it really did. but there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable. i'm a horror movie weenie and i thought it was stupid; as did my 13-year old! i was expecting to be at least creeped-out. and, yes, the gross-factor of the vines squirming in the people was there; however, the lead-up to getting to the ruins is just dumb, dumb, dumb.i mean really who goes on a hike...in a jungle... with a total stranger... with a little water and a few snacks...in flip flops, no less?! puh-lease! better still who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or being able to speak a bit of the language? are these people complete morons?the german's brother isn't heard from and he doesn't call for assistance? who doesn't do that? he just finds some greeks and americans to go on a little search and find?

i was really disappointed with this movie. i had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters. as a result of this, i was really excited to see it when it came to dvd. i thought that it was going to be a high-paced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a snail-paced predictable movie. it dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape, the ending was completely frustrating. i gave this movie two stars for one reason. this is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy slashing a bunch of people to death. the story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies. even though i don't like this movie, i recommend that all horror fans do see it at least once. you may surprisingly like it. as for this horror fan, all i can say is that i hope there isn't a sequel to this forgettable movie.

the movie started off o.k. a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a hike. they uncover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple like fortress. angry villagers show up and try to deter them from climbing it, but because of the language barrier people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing. turns out the plants are evil blood-thirsty things that the villagers won't go near so they guard the temple so the tourists can't get off. there are a couple of scares in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. i mean they're plants! don't bother buying or renting the d.v.d. wait till it comes out on cable.

plants in an ancient mayan pyramid structure killing all who come close. yes it is weird, as the travelers do not figure it out until everything starts doing crazy. and in a movie like this, i just wished it went absurd and had marching bands being attacked by plants wielding machetes.anyway, a group of people from america vacation and go into the mountains with a couple of other newly made german friends who know about the place. when they get there, mayans began shouting at them and hide on the structure. and when there, thats when the plants decide to take them out, mimicking cell phone noises, humans, and ancient mayan dead people.nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining. not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap. i kept looking for something really good to happen, but nothing. oh well. "f"

when i saw 6.0 on imdb, i was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining. at first i thought it was going to be some disturbing, unseen evil force (having not read the book) to terrify the audience -- but it turns out to be something rather mundane -- killer plants. regardless, i am a rather open-minded individual when it comes to movies so i thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on carnivorous vines.unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of clich√© and lack of any originality. to top it off, the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity. unless the movie is intentionally a bad b-rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness, no movie should ever ever ever have a main character irritate you if one expects the audience to care about the character. such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. characters were undeveloped, the monsters (plants in this case) left unexplained, and clich√©s were dripping all over.the only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloody/gory scenes, although the gore pales in comparison with movies like high tension or ichi the killer. consistently failed logic (such as why would a character not watching the top of a rope during a second attempt at descending into the ruins when it just snapped and almost killed someone), even if minor, adds up and just continues to anger the audience. the movie could've saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to reprimand or "redeem" idiot characters who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes). but to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character, in turn taking away the terror of the movie.overall this is a poorly done movie. an example of a well done movie involving pretty twenty-something's getting killed is the texas chainsaw massacre remake (and the prequel too) that certainly instilled fear and had much less character logic flaws. in summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, go watch it if there's nothing else. otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-par flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like the hills have eyes remake.

i have to say that this movie was not what i expected. even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with. with the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most, but not a crocodile. either way this film was like that, it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect. but plants?.... come on, is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd?. as for this movie it will hit the 'b' list in no time. i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see, but it didn't make up for the rest of the film. and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed. i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects. i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense. the thing had a better story line than this did. even the ring had me jumping for more, but the ruins is just that..... ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers. the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder.

the scariest thing about freshman director carter smith's new horror movie "the ruins" is the closing credits that list comedian ben stiller as one of the executive producers. what was stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. oscar-nominated scenarist scott b. smith of "a simple plan," adapting his own bestselling novel, sticks steadfastly to the standard clich√©s and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense, we're treated to yet another film where american tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are americans. furthermore, unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed, "the ruins" provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines. the set-up for "the ruins" resembles the 2006 horror movie "turistas" where slimy south americans trapped brainless american backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. indeed, "turistas" generated some legitimate thrills and chills. "the ruins" spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. a malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. the rest of "the ruins" borrows from another movie: "the descent," a superb, 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. a couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind, too. they are the straightforward 1968 hammer horror classic "the lost continent" about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the roger corman cult class "the little shop of horrors" (1961)about a new york florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop.. "the ruins" unfolds in the scenic, sunny mexico where four frolicking american college kids, eric (shawn ashmore of the "x-men" movies), stacy (laura ramsey of "the covenant"), jeff (jonathan tucker of "sleepers") and amy (jena malone of "pride & prejudice"), are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool, but a helpful teutonic, twentysomething tourist, mathias (joe anderson of "copying beethoven") recovers it, and the group embraces him as newest best friend. these people live to party, and they have already made friends with a trio of greek tourists. mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. he offers to take them with him and they accept. first rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going, you'd be well advised to avoid it. since they have only one day left, and they haven't done anything adventurous, our two couples along with their spanish-speaking greek friend, dimtri (newcomer dimitri baveas), decide to follow mathias and check the pyramid out. they catch a bus into the interior of mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. a cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear, you steer clear. a crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat. no sooner have our heroes found the mysterious mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. they know that the pyramid is haunted, and they kill dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. the remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. eventually, the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. at this point, "the ruins" turns into "bug," the recent and ridiculous ashley judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. one particularly gruesome scene shows the americans lopping off the german guy's legs to save his life. by comparison, it makes the tortures of the spanish inquisition look tame. "the ruins" ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it.

this movie was really awful. it was not in the least bit frightening, or even startling. i went to see it with a bunch of friends and by the end of the night we were saying "the ruins ruined my night." i would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident.it is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. the plot was nearly non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and they gave no back story whatsoever for anything that was happening, and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel.

god! where do i begin? from start to finish, i could not help to hate this movie. vines? vines that make cell-phone noises?! oh yeah, i'm so scared - i'm going to rid the weeds of earth! come on people! the plot went nowhere, when the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, amy (jena malone) was there to take pictures! that whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau, jeff (johnathon tucker), sawing off mathias (joe anderson) legs. when the idiots first threw down the rope after mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground. i cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie, there is just too much to cover. i will say the graphics as far as the gore were terrific, but it amounted to nothing since the acting and script were so terrifically bad.

i saw this movie with very low expectations. i didn't know a lot about it so i wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it.the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to. the suspense continues when the mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins.then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless. the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value.the fact that they didn't make any attempt to fight the vines from hell. they had fire and didn't try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real. it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and don't have half a brain to try to fight back.

i watched the first 10 minutes of this show i think i'm gonna barf now! one worst shows on tv. it's not even funny. it's so lame it's disgusting. i gave it a second and third change couldn't even make it through five minutes. don't waste the time. this is one of the many shows that need to go bye bye. speaking of regular night time shows that need to go. all the shows on cbs. all the shows on abc. all the shows on fox and joe buck. all the shows on the new cw network. all the shows on nbc.(accept the law and order series). all the morning and afternoon talk shows. all the court tv shows. and every reality show out there!! every stupid game show. period the end! all the home improvement shows! and all the media news. all it is.is a 24 hour loop of bad news. yes,i do have favorites monk,the law & orders thats it for me.

my name is earl(2005) review:......for i have seen this.this is something else. first off, how is this rated so high? i cannot understand that. this "show" is filled to the top with either annoying people, stupid people, or just plain unlikeable. the "gags" are hideous.i saw one episode where the wife of earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish. not kidding. that wasn't funny, that's repulsive. then she and earl's extremely stupid brother(and i mean stupid) then had sex. i nearly threw up.this has to be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time. jason lee is a talented actor, but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy".earl is now in jail for this current season. let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery.the last word: this show would be funny to people who think larry the cable guy is funny. to the rest of the world, not a chance. avoid like the plague.

it seems like people are attracted to shows that showcase pathetic lives that have no purpose what-so-ever. to me i give my sincerity to nbc for their dire efforts to make new changes in television, making laugh track free shows. they seem to always find big success, like the office. when i first started to watch it seemed to me that it could have potential to be a smash hit. but after a couple of episodes, i really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people showcased in these lowlife, poor, disgraceful areas. and the end where they show earl and the brother in bed together, it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people who struggle to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society are like. i just seem to always be disgusted when i watch the filth the people in this show live in. it's like venice beach in california, beautiful but so many hobos. believe me i'm no rich guy, middle class, and not a clean freak either, a bit sloppy, but it just seems to me that the show just can't seem to get off of all the gruesome, schmuck people out there who have one leg. i just wish that they would show a little more class, not all filth and poorness and trailers and just below average life, it just seems to depress me. to me this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life, what not to be. it also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of smarts. this is a schmuck-u-mentary.

after i couldn't ignore the hype about the show, i started watching season one and it struck me as really good and i was hooked.... for about 5 episodes, then it started to spiral downwards. why? first, ethan suplee is scripted to act as a complete idiot confirming that very obviously by spewing out semi-random stuff in great expectations of it somehow becoming the next best joke.jaime pressly's got stunning looks, but if she thinks stretching lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange grimaces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious, she's way off track. maybe she thought her character would be too flat, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but made a flood of colors, overkill of spices and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes, ears and intellect.i really, really wanted to love this show, like i said, the premise is great, (comes from the same shelf as the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain) and jason lee is doing a pretty good job here, along with some of the other actors but there is no way no how i would get 'sucked in' and forget that this is just a show, because pressly's and suplee's surreal, extreme characters abruptly wake me when they show up. it's worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn't a 70 something-part series and if they didn't get that much screen time.

with the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jamming fall, summer, winter and spring line-ups, it's nice to see a show that sets itself from the lot in more than one area. 'earl' takes an unusual approach. it's not about the "daily musings of an eccentric family" (zzzz..) nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms. the show is about this small-time white trash thief (earl) who scratches off a lottery card and scores big time. right at that moment, 'karma' took it away from him. overtime, he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he's been doing, so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he's got all his deeds on a paper.this is a brilliant premise for a sitcom. thankfully, it landed in the right hands. the execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results: you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times. you can't help but fall in love with earl's sincerity and steadfastness, randy's simple mind, good heart and observations on life, joy's wild, flamboyant personality and darnell's mellow, chillin' demeanor that really endears him to you very easily.when you combine the show's innovation with its genuine humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a keeper. with shows like this (and the incomparable "the office"), nbc is obviously on to something. did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance? let's hope so. and let's hope for more quality shows like these will occupy the line-ups; shows that'll make both us tv viewers and nbc executives stop crying over the long gone days of nbc's golden days (frasier, seinfeld, friends)

i agree with the comments regarding the downward spin. the last view shows have been a little better, but surely the writers need some more direction. i think the characters are still interesting, although sometimes they spin into the "white trash" things a little too much. subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like "office". i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup. one would think that karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows, but they only scratch the surface of the subject. in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses. we can handle more heady content. it has been proved before in many other shows.

other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time. if not for jason lee's unjustifiable success in film, this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead. the concept is terrible. moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. is it funny? periodically but not consistently. is it stupid? each and every single episode. i've seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this blunder has survived longer than i ever could have imagined. the dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes. every episode for someone with an iq over 100 is an absolute struggle. and the icing on the cake? jason lee's annoying voice narrating each episode. if it weren't for the state's southern culture and rednecks of the south, this show wouldn't have an audience.if you're a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet overflowing with bad taste, bad dialog and dimwit characters failing at life...well then you're probably an actor on this show.

have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades? if you have don't bother with this one as you've already seen most of the scenes already - and i can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies.the story (i'm sure that true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead). every character is based in a clich√© and... well, they're nothing but the clich√©. and yes, again all you need to be a hero is to be american.at least in finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the dvd was made for. maybe i should sell my player then...1/10

another awful movie from hollywood. this time a female helps the revolution in a central american country. yeah yeah yeah. hey lets make a movie without any sense of realism at all. i am so sick of movies like this one. the actors and actresses are lousy, the effects are cheesy and the dialog horrible. and suddenly i see john rhys-davies as the evil president. from gimli to hugo louis ramos. i bet he is very proud of this. well i shouldn't have expected much of this movie and i didn't. and i am glad cause this sucks bigtime. i wonder what kind of people who like this movie. my guess is younger people aged 12-16. and i guess some people like because of kristin dattilo. well i am in neither of those group and i hate it. rating: 2

infamous for being "brought to you by the digital effects team behind independence day," coronado is even more of a spectacular failure just from being juxtaposed with id4. this ridiculous mess of a film starts off with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there. a wealthy, soon to be married couple in beverly hills are the subjects of this idiotic story. claire's fianc√©e has taken off on a business trip right around christmas, so she decides to spontaneously fly to switzerland so they can spend the holiday together. i especially love that her initial reason for wanting to go was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need. she grabbed them up and yelled after him while he drove away, concluding that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than call his cell phone. i refuse to believe that a couple living in such a cavernous mansion as theirs were unaware of the existence of mobile phones.so up until this point, the movie is unbelievably bad, but check this out, this is where it starts to get bad! she gets to switzerland and when she can't find her husband she gets some cake and calls her friend to whine about how unfair it all is. this woman is not an action hero, and she is definitely not a german indiana jones, for crying out loud. she is an overgrown cheerleader, a pampered sorority girl whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels out of the ground when she gets tipsy enough to wander onto the lawn during a wine and cheese party out on the bluffs.she gets a tip that her fianc√©e is in south america, so she, like, totally flies there to get him. once there, this moron thinks she's going to go into the jungle by herself, sniff out the enemy base and rescue her poor helpless boyfriend. she laughs off a comment about the danger of going in there, then freaks out later because she finds out that there are battles going on. "you never said anything about battle!"there is one point where claire and some journalist that she met up with drive this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across and suspended by two by fours. literally. there are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with twine, and these morons decide to drive over it. not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck, but claire manages to fall off of it, falling hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below. later she recalls the event, laughing it off like, oh maybe it was only a hundred. at least she wasn't twirling gum on her fingers.what is truly sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to coax a terribly performance out of the tremendously talented john rhys-davies, a real indiana jones veteran. there is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the film, where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we first meet him, has such a thick accent that he rolls his r's like he thinks he's in a ruffles commercial, then later he talks like some guy they pulled off the streets of venice beach. unbelievable.the special effects are negligible. the team that brought you independence day, by the very fact that they were involved with id4, was simply going through the motions, throwing together some matted and blue screen shots, i have to believe because they just had nothing better to do. the story is astonishingly bad, and kristin dattilo, who many other imdb users cite as the only reason to see the film, doesn't put the slightest effort into her performance. maybe she thought the digital effects team behind independence day could superimpose some meaning into this mess.and given how far they've fallen, maybe they thought they could, too.they could at least have tried.

this movie is just as bad as it gets. if you like logic (or the lack of it) √° la national treasure and bad acting as well, then it could be a movie for you.otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer.actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved (ie. actors, special effects and so on). accidentially they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent.in a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product.it is really lousy.

so we're supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - to the warzone - just to find out why her fianc√©e didn't travel to switzerland? or are we supposed to take it seriously? it's not even remotely funny, clever or entertaining - it's stupid - and so is the movie. the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie - even worse than jar-jar binks. dialog tries very hard to be funny (almost all the time) but it never is. the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. and as for the plot - did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for (other than being anti-government)? i guess that didn't matter to anyone - neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield. don't waste your time. "coronado" is neither funny nor entertaining.

it didn't feel like a movie, and was thankfully short (under 90minutes), it felt more like a commercial of possibilties in computer graphics: most of the special effects are great, to be sure. but that cerainly don't a great or even a good movie make. not saying it's absolutely worthless viewing, since it's possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci, or what ever it's called.as i read somewhere, "you can't fix it in the cutting room", a bad story and non-directed actors, can't be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects! things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from.however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea, since usa is the crooks.and isn't it sooo typical of low budget stories, they have to create an imaginative country south of mexico??well well i gace it 2! just because of the special effects, the rest is absolute trash!

i went to see this film over matchstick men, in fact buying the tickets to matchstick men and going to the other, because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, thrills, jungles, and exotic locations. they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of story.all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback story.here is all the movies from what i've seen the film was derived from: of course, indiana jones and romancing the stone, but also true lies, proof of life, that old 80s tom selleck movie, bananas (woody allen), and hero (from the use of digital extras).ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.

just saw coronado... around here the only line they came up with to sell it is "from the fx team behind independence day". i think that says a great deal. no talk about writers, directors, actors...it's a cute little adventure story set in a banana republic in mid america, but the storyline is thin.all the way through the movie i kept thinking about how much this movie looks like the cut-scenes from some action computer war game. although the fxs are nice, they all too often are visible. much like the cut scenes in cgs style like command'n'conquer.you almost instantly know that that particular truck, backdrop, bridge, castle, or jet fighter never existed. the look is smooth and nice, but not up to the standard we have come to expect of action adventures today. the movie is lacking a lot of obvious on-location filming.the acting, storyline is below average and the fxs are nice but not up to feature film standard. i am not surprised this thing went straight to video/dvd.

the bipolarity of this movie is maddening. one moment it's making fun of latin americans, american tourists and banana republics in general, the other it wants to be touching, with burned villages and orphans. even the serious revolutionary hero, becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point. but the comedy parts aren't even funny, because it's so obviously stolen from star wars. yes, star wars, the "hero" is basically a rogue with a heart of gold. add to this stereotypical sounds effects, latin americans who speak english with one another, and a villain that just disappears from the story. and whats the point? it's basically revolution propaganda with no resolution, and no planning (because, there is just no way these people can lead a country). the us government are bad guys, but who'll make money producing this? not some poor farmer, that's for sure.

if you are 10 years old and never seen a movie before, maybe this film may be entertainment for you, but if you've seen several movies, this one will be a silly fully-cliched cheap and predictable for you. don't waste your time with this.

while it's one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume 1, there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it! the box labels it "hell hole" but the screen title is escape from hell hole. the title is confusingly similar to hell hole (1978) aka "escape from women's hell hole" a group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom, who they easily overpower. no nudity in this or any other scene, however.a woman named cardena drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women. she invites indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle m.g. once they get there, it becomes clear that m.g. wants to take indri's virginity. m.g. runs some sort of house of prostitution, and he's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military, or runs a paramilitary outfit, or prefers for his guards to all wear military-style uniforms.the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison. indri gets sent there. the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards.various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made, but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have: they outnumber the guards vastly, and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or handguns.wip genre enthusiasts may like it, and the fact that it was made in the philippines gives it some novelty, but otherwise... eh.

virginal innocent indri finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless pimp mg. indri winds up incarcerated in mg's private prison after she refuses to make love to him. of course, indri and worldly top con helga join forces and plan to escape. maman firmansyah's blah, uninspired direction and piet burnama's dull, talky script thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality this flick needs in order to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes-behind-bars exploitation junk: the sluggish pace painfully drags throughout, there's no gratuitous female nudity whatsoever (the girls don't even show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene!), the expected torture and degradation are both extremely tame and tepid, the moderate crummy gore likewise fails to impress, and even a ridiculous catfight sequence ain't nothing to get excited about. thomas susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the laughably lousy dubbing, the excruciatingly overlong 102 minute running time, the sappy theme song, and gatot sudarto's cornball score add further abject insult to already appalling injury. only some decent last reel break-out action offers a little relief from the otherwise overly abundant stultifying tedium. a complete yawn-inducing dud.

it was only the second year of the academy but already they were voting politically - jeanne eagels' brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to make do with an oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst performance ever to win - mary pickford's in coquette. the only existing print was a work print without music or final editing, but wherever it's shown, eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling, powerful performance. she is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth (we did after all see her kill the man), we in the audience find ourselves, like the jurors, believing in her innocence, before we suddenly catch ourselves. that is great acting. the film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again. (one silent of jeanne's exists in archive print - man, woman and sin - and her only other talkie, jealousy, is "lost," so this is the only document we have of her. run to see it (when it first came out of the archives to be shown in nyc in the early 70s, the village voice printed a full page review, worshipping the eagels performance).

while it was nice to see a film about older people finding each other and falling in love and the performances by andrews and garner were not bad, this picture poured on the sapp and schmaltz at every turn. every curve in the plot was in view from a mile away!

i'm a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in oz being my all time favourite american tv show . i guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens' bottoms , but i found don siegel's riot in cell block 11 to be rather disappointing . okay i knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language , graphic shankings and gang rape but even so it's a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like each dawn i die and white heat . the problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader dunn being something of a prison reformer . yeah that sounds ridiculous since he's a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary , but that's what he is in essence , he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer . there's also a problem of making a b movie with such radical themes ( quite ironic that siegel would later make dirty harry where the only good criminal is a dead one ) and that is the cast isn't very good with emile meyer as the warder being especially irritating in his performance . like i said a disappointing movie

when i first saw this movie, i said to myself, "hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie, why not rent it?". so yeah, i rented it and went back home to see it. when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shocked.well first of all, no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish, good thing it had subtitles.second, it was nude, nude nude! since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies, you could see my shock when i saw it. *gasp! covering virgin eyes, noo*third, predictable to say the least, but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies, because i don't seem to care if it's predictable, unless it's way over the top. fourth, how heidi and kike were reunited, so cheesy. fifth, how the movie ended. it was a bad, bad ending. how mr. van der linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter, knew how to throw the party... blah, blah. i was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it, the director might have just rushed it. after all of this bashing of the bad stuff, the good stuff's are here to come. the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, heidi's attitude, valentina being poetic with words. what i really also like about it was the song that valentina made with her girl friend. that's all, and for the other stuffs that i haven't mentioned they were just so-so.

adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. she needs to be the center of attention and she'll act stupid to make it so. with her attitude she gets sent to charm school.there she meets the typical characters in today's cinema; the nerd, the clumsy one, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. things happen and in the end adela "learns her lesson" so to speak. the plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state adela is in, but utterly fails to deliver (at least i didn't buy it). so what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. plus the director seems to have a breast fixation, adela flashes her boobies a few times too many, at least i can't see that they are relevant to the story.so the film is ok, but if you are like me and don't like to watch a teenager pissing people off and making a behavioral u-turn in an instant, which i found very unbelievable, think twice before watching.

i can't believe i actually bought this movie! it sucks! ... where i live mexican movies mexican movies are never advertised, or even available ... you can't find them in the regular rental places... so i had to buy it ... i really like mexican movies! they bring me closer to my roots, and my people, and they are way different that what your normally used to... but this one was soo predictable!!! your could guess what was going to happen... i'ts not a horrible movie! it just wasn't worth what i paid for it! jaja... but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah u should watch it.. but if you love mexican movies, and love theater itself then don't watch it it'll be painful! lol

ni√±as mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera. the acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas, i guess the writer and director has seen too many mexican soap operas and can't conceive anything remotely different. give it up, go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please. stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable mexican film industry. it is not an ok or good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!

why? why? why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible, horrible movie? i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he didn't stopped me from seeing this revolting "comedy". i cant believe i paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste. i'm starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of martha higareda 's nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this ... i will call it "thing" cause call it film is an insult to the mexican film industry. the characters are a huge clich√©, the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is... well, i cant believe a human being wrote this. and just when you thought you've been tortured enough...the last half hour is so painful that i wished to ripped my eyes out. the only good thing i can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes (that would feel like centuries, but still). really, avoid the pain!!!

makes "invasion usa" look like "apocalypse now". this one can only be recommended to us skinheads, john birch supporters or militia members. the message is very simple : let's shoot them all - gooks, commies, latinos, everything that isn't american.besides, this is badly acted, badly scripted, badly interpreted, incredibly stupid but no fun at all. this movie could be used as a toorture device by cia torturers. oops, sorry, there can't be any us torturers because they are the good

with no dead heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. william sanders is saved by his buddy harry cotter during an extraction in vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. fast forward ten years and harry is now a brainwashed russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. his new russian superior is ivan played to the obscene hilt by nick nicholson who might i add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in kentucky with his stained teeth. what is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film. soon william is re-recruited by the cia to hunt harry down. he teams up with barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated ivan's el salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of south america. some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. one such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by william and barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music i've ever heard. who would strip completely nude in the middle of a south american jungle? there is a rape scene that uses the end theme from blood on satan's claw as well. no dead heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. in one scene harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. i had to rewind it and count. hard to find film that has recently gotten the full hd treatment by mgm. track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.

addle-brained stupidity that the cartoon "bullwinkle" made fun of a quarter-century beforehand, no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie (the manchurian candidate) without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder. the acting barely registers on the cable-access tv scale, the plot is less nuanced than an old "sgt. rock" comic, and only boris j. badanov-style "bad guy" mustaches are missing from the commies. this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad, too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposable thumbs.

this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. you think manos is the worst movie ever? it doesn't even come close to this garbage. i dont even know where to begin. the "russian" commander and the rebel chic are the worst "actors" ever to appear in a movie. they make the sister in troll 2 look like meryl streep. the goofy faces the chic makes while she's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. then there is the oompa music during the prison break, the totally out of place love scene, the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene, the fake castro, the fact that everybody has either a headband and/or a bandanna on some part of their body, the goofiest rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting ever put on film. this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans. definitely the worst movie ever made.

totally brain-dead actioner made in the philippines. this belongs to the mode of filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market. after a rather dull beginning, the movie takes off and never disappoints again. it is actually a rip-off of the worst movies chuck norris ever made : an american prisoner in vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope, then the president of the usa. one of his old buddies (played by b-movie stalwart max thayer) is sent to stop him. utterly ridiculous action scenes, putrid acting (nick nicholson's performance as the evil soviet commander is a must-see!)and implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public.

as a native of new orleans, i can state that almost everything in this movie, from the atrocious n'awlins dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of crescent city geography, is horrible. this is another one of those big hollywood movies that decides to stereotype new orleans as: 1. a city full of french-sounding idiots 2. a city full of people who sound as if they've just returned from blanche dubois' summer home 3. a city of drunkards, where every day is mardi gras 4. a city of deep mystery, where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo (i admit that maybe we are a city of drunkards; although every day is not mardi gras). "the big easy" is one of the worst films about new orleans. i wouldn't recommend it to anybody.

new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in thisdebacle of a film. quaid's attempt at speaking with a cajunaccent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in neworleans) is terrible. plot = elementary and mindless. thispicture refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves agradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film. there's none of that here. "bigeasy" tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes. don't be fooled - the real big easy is nothing like the townthat quaid & barkin bumble their way through.

young quaids fake accent was difficult to accept at times.the show was billed as mystery/suspence but should have been listed as a romance.don't rent this one if you are sleepy, it will knock you out.

licence fees to watch this trash, and pay for it with hard-earned cash? humourless, no hint of laughter, god knows how it won a bafta! we've now been subjected to "eastenders" for twenty years. when, oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is? crass pap! this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut, and never has done.the eastenders i know (the real ones) are kind, courageous, hardworking and loyal. and one of their greatest attributes is humour. it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler. and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including an omnibus)? nothing but a bunch of moaning, wailing, "dead from the neck up" wimps, who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other. what a great advert for britain that is!! do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out? obviously the woolly-minded section of the public does, but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything.

the other lowest-rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add. i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children, who insist on watching the sunday omnibus. my god, it's depressing! like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other, but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be. the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot-on. if anyone lived in a social environment like this, they'd slash their wrists within days. and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more 'ethnically enriched' than you'll ever see here. take my advice - avoid this nadir of the british tv industry. it is evil.

if this is classed as 'real life' of london, then the producers must be on different planet.it is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dingy, dross on tv.everyone is fighting, everything has nasty under tones running through it, nothing is done for genuine reasons.if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk, then this programme is by the farthest from reality.there is not one good word i can say about this programme. the only certainty is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner.even the characters are totally unbelievable!

this soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years, eastenders is the prime example. for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders "mirrors life"? life on which planet, exactly? it's written about "working-class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the "working-class" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders.this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford.thus, it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders.other soaps have followed in ee's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash. the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves. meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new, tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy.and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room. it's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison.

i think this programme is a load of rubbish. all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting?! these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives. also, the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes, i am bored with it. i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show 'tv burp' e.g. the weak joke "the princess and the pea isn't exactly shakespeare is it?" that had sonia and naomi in stitches. i don't see how that is funny. i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv licence so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. isn't there anything better than this?

i don't know how people can watch this - the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die, houses burn down, car crashes, babies die, and cast members being killed off every week. its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings. its so depressing. i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying - 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or 'whose house shall we torch in a months time?'its the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment, and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore

it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened. the 'square' is peopled by such a miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, spiteful, unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined. everyone is stabbing someone in the back, everyone is attempting to commit adultery, everyone is trying to cheat someone. that, or they are being stabbed, cuckolded or swindled. nobody is cheerful. nobody laughs. nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day. it's hell, with cockney accents.i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the samaritans. it's perfect viewing for the depressed. it doesn't cheer them up; what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad-arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse - they might be living in 'albert square'.apart from the above; as a representation of london's east end, it is pure hokum. the programme-makers have evidently never been across town. the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque. and this pretty-well defines the racial majority of the population. white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road flyover, and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that 'eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly'. ten healthy, smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation. eight of them are dark-skinned... what's more, i used to work with a bunch of anglo-saxon - dare i say 'pukka' - cockneys a few years ago. and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i've never had. each day was like an oswald moseley rally. they couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation. in fact their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixated upon sex-organs and their application. alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison.any programme that purported to represent london's native east-end caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast - even after the 9 o-clock watershed. imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark. but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful.i don't know how such a soap-opera came to be. this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever. and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition, it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic-depressives with cockney accents - what's the point of that?dull, dreary, unrelentingly disillusional, and ethnically preposterous. the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation.avoid it like the plague.

i've watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now. when i came across it on dvd, i didn't hesitate too long, even more, because i have a predilection for early belmondo flicks. but what a bad surprise! some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to shock audiences.widely hailed as one of chabrol's rare cynic works, the only lasting impression i got from re- watching it is... boredom. some movies really do not age in style. but what about movies which didn't have any sense of style at all?the flaws in the script, uninspired acting - presumably due to the lack of direction -, a sort of production design, which doesn't deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, last but not least, the worst editing job i've seen in ages, make this one truly hard to stand.my impression was, that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously, no idea or any skills at all. it really comes as a surprise, that this one didn't abruptly end chabrol's career. don't blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s, this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.

speed which i believe is direct copy of the hollywood movie cellular (i haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. i have watched this movie today on 12th january 2008 on rented vcd. it's release date is 19th oct 2007. but still fortunately for me i didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. so in this situation when i watch the movie, i feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance.off course as a bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. but now days it doesn't matter for me, if i haven't seen the original movie. i just found the main theme much similar to 'nick of time' and 'badshah'. in the movie sanjay suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef. this brings back the memory of 'true-lies'. the only new part was the use if the phone. but that too i found out now is taken from movie cellular. so when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear.the things i like about the movie is its pace. as the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. but this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional bollywood style of dhishum dhishum.the plot of the movie is also quite interesting. three stories going parallel, one after the other. one of the kidnapping of urmila, the other of the zayed trying to help urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister. these three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues.but then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. except sanjay suri, none other makes any impression. this goes even for urmila, who is always promising in rgvs movies. due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted. e.g. the scene at the end where urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. but instead we just wait for the end of that scene.other than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. showing so cool villains is good for hollywood movies not for bollywood the background of london is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. may be director has an impression that the climax in hindi movies must have such fights. they look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends.over and all, i find the movie once watchable. if it is coming on tv or you can get it on rent its ok. but then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. next time, when the movie is on tv, you can safely watch other channels.

welcome to the world of vikram bhatt, the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like kasoor, raaz and also the multistarrer awara paagal deewana and his one film with aamir ghulamone sneak peak about this films are that all are hollywood remakes and some decent ones like the once which workedspeed is a remake of cellular and that too a terrible one a look at the stars, we have the once saleable but now out of work urmila and sanjay suri, then we have the flop aftab, ashish chaudhary, zayed khan and othersthe film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there the storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like zayed hijacking a mobile company and many more and the stunts too are laughable while the twists in the end are too laughable the film also took a long time to reach the theatres which looses it's sparkdirection is awful music is outdatedzayed khan screams, makes faces.etc what he does always urmila is good in her part, sanjay suri is not that convincing ashish chaudhary tries hard in a negative role and he is okay aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role surprising the same director gave him his only solo hit kasoor sophie is horrible tanushree is a non actress

wait till you watch this one.... i mean even after reading this review. no other movie till date has sucked more than this one.... one thing i wont understand is that, when you are ripping off some english flick why to add your own creativity? with the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for "cellular" to be dubbed into hindi and released the movie. they might have gotten some profits that way i guess. if there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from tanushree datta and the girl who played the sidekick to aftab. i don't know if my problem is that i have seen cellular much earlier than this movie..... but that cant be a reason to support this movie... i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie.....please stay away from this flick.

this is a rip-off from cellular. bad casting... bad direction... bad music...and the list goes on...well there was no direction since story, scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie. even fight sequence is copied. one with the mace was from kill bill and another one with fire hose was from either a jet li's or jackie chan's movie (i am not able to recall the name of this movie)... stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing... cannot expected something original from any of the bhatts any more!!!

now that's it's 2008, who really has a care in the world about a guy like db sweeney, even back then he wasn't a big deal.two tickets to paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances. again, a proved plot. the problem with this film, other than it's 'so bad it's compelling' title, is the script.clich√© after clich√© three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie... and blow up vanna white's house.john c. mcginley's acting job is superb, especially compared to that of the late db sweeney's. (his career is dead, hence the late. though i hear he's moving to tv, good for him). also, john c likely has the least awful character in the film.the score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from 1993, or jeff anderson's movie now you know (also set me back a few years, but at least that was more entertaining.) i mean, yah, i guess i enjoyed parts of it. but, the nerdy guy is annoying, db tries to be this cool failed guitar player (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper, and john c is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his bookie's henchmen.i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better. but i think burning the script would have been a healthy start.but, as i've hinted this whole time, it's not the worst movie ever. and any chance i have to see mcginley in a starring role, i'll take it. hopefully he starts getting some better projects.

it is such a shame when actors and actresses of high quality get involved with pure crap, probably because they were offered a great deal of money. not one of helen mirren's better career moves. the acting of the "teens" is simply appalling, not helped by a script that is in parts simply inept.most of kevin williamson's work is above average box office dross, but this is really below par. this is the sort of movie that you watch on tv when there is nothing better on and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and are waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.

the only reason i watched this movie a second time, was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl playing opposite katie holms. her name is marisa coughlan. never heard of her before. she is lovely. captivating. with an animated face, and cute bod, she is highly watchable... she's got real, "poisenality"... more than a passing vibe of grace kelly... with youthful exuberance. i think she is irish in gene pool, (my favorite female dna) so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american. the movie is unremarkable, katie holms is classic beauty in the flesh. but marisa coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. in 1999 when this movie was made, she was around 25 years old, in her prime. this reminds me of another silly, worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it. it was "career opportunites" with the first time i saw jennifer conoly. or "grease ii" the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer.

you know, i'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies (see jawbreaker, disturbing behavior, etc). every scene of genuine tension here (and there is some) is immediately undercut with some cheesy pop tune, completely diluting the suspense. why do they do that? to sell some soundtracks, of course, but in this case, mission unaccomplished - did anyone buy the cd?and yeah, ms. mirren attacks her role with zest and relish (with some cheez-wiz to add kick). but what are molly, leslie and vivica doing here? their roles (they're so underused that i cannot use "characters" here) have no purpose in the storyline, so i can't figure out why three well-known actresses had been cast.oh, and the ending is so unbelievably hackneyed and irresponsible. the kids get off scot-free and act as if nothing happened - all smiles at graduation. they're criminals, people! no consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, grade tampering) - nothing.little things too - was tingle's tale about her husband true? what's with the crossbow? would the virginal katie character loose her cherry on a whim like that? (great message, guys.) why did mckean go to her home? how did kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment? how do students even obtain teachers' home addresses? what's with jeffrey tambor?? on what basis did mckean fire tingle? she's bloodied, battered and held hostage by students, fer cripe's sake!oh well, i'm spending way more thought on the script than mr. williamson apparently did, so i'll stop here.3/10

i made it about halfway through this movie, and at that point realized that i absolutely didn't care how it ended. it is basically a bland teen comedy that i only watched because i like helen mirren, who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacher.the basic idea of the movie (or let's say the first half of the movie, since i don't know - or care - how the second half goes) has been done before, most notably in 9 to 5, and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly tingle gets it wrong. you need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters who you care about, and you don't have that. not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.

this absurd movie was about a "goodie-two-shoe," teen-girl that really wanted to be valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name mrs. tingle. katie holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe," is faced with "the biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail mrs. tingle's test. mrs. tingle comes along, catches holmes, the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here exam, mrs. tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of holmes passing her class. and the classmate guy, who apparently has his eye on holmes, always wondered why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? feeling desperate, holmes and her friends visit mrs. tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that holmes was planning to cheat. it all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and arrow at mrs. tingle, threatening her to make things right for holmes. mrs. tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as holmes and her friend's captive.during mrs. tingle captivity under holmes, they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious coach in bed with mrs. tingle. i found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in mrs. tingle's house, eating up her food and going though her private work. at one point, holmes found mrs. tingle's grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor, decreasing the grade of her challenge for valedictorian. the end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film, resolving on pure irony, slapstick and absurdity.this has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character holmes would ever play in her entire life. i wanted to help mrs. tingle get free to really dig a grave for holmes. she was manipulative, selfish and conniving. she even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him...and she didn't like him. from attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing mrs. tingle's grade book to taking her best friend's man, you would think that holmes would get what she deserves in the end, right? unfortunately, she obtains everything her heart desires, showing that being wicked, manipulative, selfish and whining can get you what you want.mrs. tingle was suppose to be the character you didn't like. they didn't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be "taught this lesson." she was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation. personally, i felt that her opinions about young people were validated with holmes and her friend's actions every time. i kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail holmes. they kept her tied up in bed, ate up her food like a bunch of pigs, drank up the woman's wine, messed with her personal belongings and we're suppose to believe that she didn't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads? and the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film. forget idiot, we need a new word for him that isn't in the webster's dictionary. he brought the major trouble into holme's life then made things worse when he came into mrs.tingle's house, uninvited behind holmes, and corners mrs. tingle with a bow and arrow. i was thrilled every time mrs. tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him, or choke the wannabe actress best friend.if you're a teen out there and want to see when a teen's manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world, see this unfunny, caricature filled, unintentional film noir.

i heard this movie was bad¬Öthey even warned me it was terrible, but for some reason (probably katie holmes) i still watched it when it came on national tv. watching kevin williamson films means torturing! his scenarios aren't funny, definitely not scary and not the least bit creative. teaching mrs. tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series `dawson's creek' and it's probably meant for the same target group as well. before the credits even started, 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie `i love you'-sentence. it doesn't get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop/rock and the storyline is ultra-thin. three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school. every high-school has a teacher like that, you know¬Ö to save their skin, they try to convince mrs. tingle that it wasn't their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong. the typical high-school humor is completely lost on me, the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting (with the exception of helen mirren) is abominable. i'm sure katie holmes can act ¬ñ that's a fact proven by her role in `the gift' ¬ñ but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles. as said before, the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew. it's like kathleen turner in `serial mom'! the role suits her perfectly and you can't imagine anyone else playing her. other than that, this is avoidable teenage nonsense.

history teacher mrs tingle seems to have it in for student leigh ann watson, who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship. she receives another low grade from tingle, which doesn't help. when one of her classmates luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag, mrs. tingle finds it sticking out. she threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it, but he's not available. so before she reports it the next morning. leigh, her friend jo lynn and scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal. however due to tingle's stubbornness, that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out.wasn't fan of it when i first saw it, and after another viewing, i'm still not one. writer kevin williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films; 'scream (1996)', 'i know what you did last summer (1997)', 'scream 2 (1997)' and 'the faculty (1998)'. he was riding the success (also not to forget the tv show 'dawson's creek), but this project would be the final bump. the difference there, compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay, he was also making his debut in directing. the strange thing though, was that i found his direction to be competently done, but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired. it seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller, without making it gel. the script is cluttered with quick-wit, on-going gags, trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films, but the problem is that it's too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow. the fractured script had to be more strong and potent, since it's a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets. it tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness. the film's ending takes the cake. williamson's polished direction is sound, but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on. you eventually feel it after the halfway mark, and it shows up how minor the story is. the performances are tolerable enough, although if it weren't for helen mirren's classy, icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as mrs. tingle and a buoyant marisa coughlan, we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes katie holmes. barry watson is modest in his slacker part and molly ringwald has a lesser role. the soundtrack packs enough energy, but i found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices.watchable, but mechanical all round.

sorry for any spoilers that this contains. but if you want to read on anyway: i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin williamson. let's just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter, shall we? there's scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which i think are pretty funny but very overrated. besides, by making scream into a franchise, it ceased to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one. then there's i know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. he co-wrote halloween: h20, but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity. then comes the faculty, which i can only say was god-awful. (lots of fun to make fun of, though). don't even get me started on the ridiculous, soap-operatic dawson's creek, i could rail about how bad that is for hours. so then we get to teaching mrs. tingle. first of all, there are tons of little implausibilities in this one. for example: in most high schools that i know of, the valedictorian is not the only one who gets to go to college! this idea that katie holmes's character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictorian was absurd. haven't you ever heard of financial assistance, damn it!? also, i don't think you get expelled from high school or don't get into college because of cheating on one test. there are a bunch of other ones, but i'll skip to the big one now. the ending really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch. great. do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic? i'm sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story, either. that sure wouldn't be necessary. helen mirren was good, she added some nice flair to a character who (as a previous commenter noted) had no reason for anything she did. and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely can't act? her self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "you wanted me to fail. blah blah blah." her last two scenes with mrs. tingle were the worst. the only reason i don't regret losing $8.25 on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit. no, wait, i do regret losing the money: it wasn't real, and she survived. mr. williamson, if you're reading this, you've made the same movie (some violence and/or scary stuff offset by wise-ass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) just a few too many times now (i count 6 so for, not including scream 3 and whatever follows it), and i would really appreciate it if you would stop. otherwise, i might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. ok? :-)

this isn't a dreadful film, merely insipid. the plot is deeply flawed and implausible. it tries to be a number of genres and fails at each. it fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. it almost succeeds as science fiction. the direction is uninspired and katie holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. the only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is helen mirren. her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range. other than marissa coughlin's delightful exorcist rendition, mirren is the only reason to see this movie. a solid 3.0.

mr. moto's gamble has a fairly straight forward plot - when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the even more mysterious mr. moto to solve the case.i'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr. moto's gamble on imdb. because to me...well, i found it extremely disappointing. i enjoy mr. moto and i enjoy charlie chan, but i can't say i cared for this mish-mash of the two. for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr. moto's gamble, it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film. but when warner oland backed-out, some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr. moto. as i indicated, the end result left me underwhelmed. mr. moto is not chan. he's more mysterious, he's more athletic, and he's more exotic. so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - it doesn't work. and listening to lorre/moto try to deliver one of chan's trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly. add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes (something that i never seem to enjoy) and you end up with a movie that i couldn't help but dislike. if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke. but even he's not near enough to save mr. moto's gamble in my eyes.sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best i can give this one.

having spent the six years previous writing and producing, luc besson returns to the directors chair with angel-a. i'm a huge fan of l√©on, and quite liked the prospect of a black and white french film from the same chap.andr√© is a liar and gambling addict, owing money to almost every loan shark in paris. unable to repay his debts, and fed up with being held over the edge of the eiffel tower, he decides to kill himself. he happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman, who he decides to save. determined to thank him, she begins to help him fix his own life.the film starts with some laughs, which run well throughout. the visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of paris. but that is it. that's all the film has got going for it. and these mere two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of terrible film-making the movie unleashes. though i can't hugely fault the main character (his inconsistencies are close though), the eponymous one is ghastly. a terrible screen presence and bitterly annoying. the plot is ridiculously inconsistent itself, and at times bizarrely silly, particularly the ending; an ending which completely bloodied the fledgling redemption engendered by the scenes immediately prior to it. perhaps the most ridiculous scene i've had the ignominy of observing, it is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic, and considerably too awful to be "so bad it's funny". the overall premise of the film could conceivably have once held potential, but it is brutally massacred by the unendingly terrible implementation of its ideas. the film really was a task to watch, and one which had me screaming at the screen the whole way through.massively and immeasurably flawed, angel-a is just plain bad. though its occasionally fun dialogue manages to draw out chortles at rare intervals, by the end it is clear that this film is nothing more than repugnant.

angel-a is a change of pace for besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. it is well photographed on location in paris, although subtitle-readers should note: quick-fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing.this film is no "wings of desire" or "wonderful life". despite its shared themes (heavenly intervention averts suicide, angel/mortal relationships ensue), besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. even the well acted, teary moments, rapidly descend into toe-curling sentimentality.the film's flawed ideology irritates; an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour; a "happy ending" which negates the hero's supposed journey from helplessness to self-esteem and independence.verdict: quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine. 4/10

this is a really obnoxious show. it is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since 'reality' got in style. tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste. is a house show the place for sex appeal? apparently some males like the show because they find tanya attractive. the other boss is not pretty but he's fully as rude and also has awful taste. it is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them. most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone. most of them ..like the 'crew'..need to be taught manners. i can imagine how awful the british show is since the british reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste.what happened to the arts and entertainment channel? when it started out (and for some years afterward) it was filled with treats. now it's one big trash machine.

clossius says that "baltic storm" is banned in sweden. that is not correct! instead you can buy the film almost everywhere, like in gas stations, shopping malls, internet (of course) and so on. often to a very low price because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep up the interest. the movie only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psychos and other persons living in la-la-land and those who "knows the truth". working on a museum with the estonia disaster as a theme i have meet them all! i have heard about every theory that exists like cocaine-smuggling, weapon-smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, the russian- the american- the estonian- the swedish- and the finnish intelligence, often in different combinations.some normal persons have asked why we don't show the film? a question only asked by them who haven't seen this terrible nonsense movie. once again, "baltic storm" is not banned in sweden. it has some entertaining qualities but what a hell is donald sutherland doing in this movie?

i have to admit, i picked this movie just for the cast, and while sutherland, scacchi, and prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the movie was such a let down. it feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts, that is, scripts lacking any depth, awful photography and editing, and hilariously lousy score! i can't believe i was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end... the sad thing is, this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. all the potential was there to make it a hit; that is, two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a great core cast (even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality). but maybe i'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.

controversial german journalist jutta rabe who herself got divers to the estonia wreck, put this silly "thriller" together to save her investment.donald sutherland is of course always watchable - but he's only in three scenes. he delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional. also, the main lead, j√ºrgen prochnov, is at times very good.the rest of the cast is, however, bad. the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary (or whatever she was - she seems not listed in the cast) is extremely bad.the script has some nice ideas, and the story is actually kind of interesting. the final screenplay should have been re-written a couple of more times though. some scenes are plain ridiculous - especially the end scenes.the film is almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. presented as a 60 minutes tv-film, this could have been really interesting. as a two hour feature, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and plain out silly.jutta rabe might be a good journalist (her ideas about governments using estonia to transport military items from estonia to sweden have been concluded as true recently, when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship estonia for this), but as a film producer she sucks.the director, the writer and the actors suck more.i give this film 3/10. i would've given it a 1, if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times, donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage.but we don't even see the boat sink! what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that? like a werewolf movie without werewolves...

i admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story. however, the movie is done so badly that most people i know couldn't sit through it. the movie was relevant to me since i lived in estonia when these events took place, but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter. the music choices do not flow well with the movie, it seems as if someone just turned a cd player on in the background to put the actors "in the mood". the acting... well, what acting? the only people acting are j√ºrgen prochnow and donald sutherland, even though prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. as far as the relationship development goes between erik westermark (j√ºrgen prochnow) and julia reuter (greta scacchi), it is like watching a train wreck. there is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments." this is not a good movie. there is a difference between trying to get a message out (could've been a documentary!) and trying to make a good movie. this is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. as a matter of fact, as a native of estonia i am offended by this miserable effort. this tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low-budget ghost chase excuse of a movie. this could have been much more!

this music is totally out of touch with the film, showing up now and then as wagnerian bombast and lone ranger hurry-up, otherwise nonexistent. the acting, outside of the two principals, is nonexistent. it would have been an excellent student film. the russian soldiers are just models trying to act. the constant interruptions with wow-explosive-camera angles and monocolor clips of pieces of people were quite irritating, but that's just a personal feeling. the story line isn't worse than others, actually not worse than most, completely ignoring logic and reason and reality. at least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. the three top-level bad guys were campy.

much like tinto brass ("caligula"), the people who made this movie can't tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism. no build-up at all, just throw naked women on the screen; no, it doesn't work that way. if close-ups of female genitalia aren't your thing, prepare to be looking away from the screen at many points (i often did). the "all women are whores at heart" mentality of the movie is offensive, and the "story" is by turns absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). but halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nowhere and involves one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a nude wrestling match, which she wins with a couple of judo moves. although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. in fact, that scene and the nice cinematography are the only two reasons i give this film * out of 4, instead of 0.

i've come to realise through watching this sort of film that i don't like them very much. caged women is yet another 'women in prison' film, and like the most of the rest of the genre; the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women. now don't get me wrong; i love nude women, but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity, and since this film has only the basic 'women are in prison' theme running through it (aswell as the essential escape, of course), i got a bit bored before the end. the film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes, but that's about the only positive element. director (and writer, ha ha) erwin c. dietrich delights in showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it's never very erotic. the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks, including some directed by jess franco. in my opinion, he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non-existent, and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene. this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time, but i reckon franco could have made more out of it. overall, this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff; but i can't say i enjoyed it.

another example of the women-in-prison genre. this is not exactly a genre known for quality films, but this is a notch below most. a bunch of women are taken from the bordellos where they work to a prison on a rocky island. once there, they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious "dialog." for a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it. the sex scenes are awkwardly acted, and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag on and on. that said, there are at least some minimal production values. on the w-i-p scale i would put it above frauen fur zellenblock neun, but below chained heat.

i'd love to write a little summary of this movie's plot, but...there simply isn't one! if you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title, you pretty much know the entire content of the film: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and women's prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. "escape of the island women" (an alternate title that isn't even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic, but it totally lacks the brutality of one. wip-flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex. director erwin dietrich surely can't compete with specialists in the field, like jess franco or joe d'amato, and he should have sticked to making ordinary soft-core flicks. the only aspects that slightly look like cult-cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant-president with fidel castro and the group-rape of a (minor?) girl by soldiers. the girls are ravishing, though, and the ibiza filming location looks very enchanting.

yet another "gay" film ruined by asinine politics. luigi's final speech just about sent me running out of the theatre with its bumper-sticker epigrams. read the comic book it was based on for a much more entertaining experience.

how much can you really say about a condom with teeth? the plot was really out there, but it was something campy to see on a friday night. the story has a lot of unexpected twists, and it's a great way to offend all you're conservative friends!

during production, this lwt series was titled 'rocket to the moon', a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough. then word came through that it had been retitled 'reach for the moon', as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series, and the same tired and boring love-triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes! any television program that decides to use the 'love-triangle' storyline for even a single episode is pushing it, but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable. there are reasons to watch however, with the scenery of the isle of wight certainly providing a beautiful setting, and the seemingly effortless performance of lynda bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks. this, however is not enough. a number of performances are noticeable , especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which jonathan kerrigan refers to as his face. i have already mentioned lynda bellingham in the role of 'fussy mother' (yes, thats as far as character development and back-story goes), but i was impressed by the actor maurice roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast, having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard attenborough's 'oh what a lovely war', and 'the eagle has landed', and tv including baywatch, holby city, the bill, eastenders, cheers, doctor who in the 80s, star trek, and even going to hollywood with sylvestor stallone in 1995s judge dredd) whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met - often incapable men, whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak. it is refreshing to see that roeves is still getting work, having also appeared in the 1998 british film 'the acid house' and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria bello and sean bean in 'the dark'. the standout reason to watch this series, even though his appearances are very few. another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program, is ben miles, in the role of the sex-mad 'typical man' brother (once again, what an original character!). as with roeves, the cv says it all. after elevating this, miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie 'v for vendetta', and the 2001 star studded film 'the affair of the necklace', alongside brian cox, adrien brody, christopher walken and jonathan pryce. unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is kerrigan and saira todd, both of whom seem to have been in casualty for too long, and haven't yet learned to act. even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory i have of her from the set, is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take, she subconsciously 'pulled her knickers out of her crack!'. familiar faces appear in each episode - child actors from cbbc programs, and dramas such as '2 point 4 children', and other regulars from commercials such as mr ben's ("they'll remember me for this"), lynda 'the oxo lady' bellingham, and others that i don't even want to remember. each episode halfheartedly tries to 'deal with issues' such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive pupils, and rocket building(!)... things that grange hill was doing better when my parents were young! overall, this series was a disappointment, and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series. unfortunately, for them they took the easy route, both in the writing and (for the most part) in the casting. i would recommend both 'waterloo road' and 'the street',to fans of good drama - the latter in particular which managed to achieve this. if you like the isle of wight, don't 'reach for the moon', reach for the holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development!

primary plot!primary direction!poor interpretation.

*****spoiler ahead*****i suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for tv movie, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but badly done, the acting wasn't especially good. and the ending of the film was just terrible. the main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film, and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath. it's completely pathetic.there is only one reason really to watch this film, yasmin bleeth, although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before ? don't bother even watching this waste of time, if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch "drop dead gorgeous" instead, it's only an infinite number of times better.

a `wacky chick' flick. a beauty contestant winds up dead and the usual suspects are rounded up. another entry in the vein of the texas cheerleader, this is an average example of its type.yasmine bleeth turns in her usual wholesome girl performance, and jill clayburgh does a good job as her stressed-out slightly obsessed mom.some mildly funny moments listening to the vapid self-serving pr coming out of contestants' mouths. (`i'd like to own a restaurant so i can give left-over food to the homeless.')you have to ask yourself what people are using for brains when they think a cheerleader spot or beauty crown is worth killing for!

this movie started out cringe-worthy--but it was meant to, with an overbearing mother, a witch of a rival, and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second. there was some goofy overacting, and a few implausible plot points (she comes in second in every single competition? all of them?) unfortunately, the movie suffers horribly from it's need to, well, be a tv movie. rather than end at the ending of the movie, an amusing twist in which the killer is (semi-plausibly) revealed, the movie continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure that justice is done. of course, now that the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift--her character gets completely rewritten, because the writers don't need to keep her identity secret any more. the cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a passably amusing movie.

no, it's just a cheap 1940s serial using the cap's good name. if you are a fan of the comic book, you will be greatly disappointed. they have radically changed the character. no shield, no bucky, no fighting the nazis, no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly: captain america is now a district attorney and no longer a gi.dick purcell as captain america? don't look too closely when he changes into his costume. it is pretty obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial(can you say flabby?). it is also very obvious that a stunt man is performing most of the action here. almost every chapter has an obligatory fist fight that is shot and performed in exactly the same way. the villain is rather bland and although he uses an alias (the scarab), he doesn't wear a disguise of any kind. the story is repetitive and very simple. the effects are laughable and the action is average. on the plus side we have sexy lorna gray as the d.a.'s assistant and the good captain gets to ride on a cool looking motorcycle in one early chapter. overall ok but nothing special.

the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one, and it is to the filmmaker's credit that he sets out to portray rural minnesotans with the same respect ordinarily reserved for coast-dwellers. it is weird, though, to find an independent movie, the brainchild of a single person, that is as unambitious and clich√©-ridden as a committee-brewed hollywood potboiler.the portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate, i think, but these characters don't ring true to me--i have had quite a few meals in small-town diners, but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth-century english novelists. one might suggest that writer/director semans has no more experience with rural culture than the coen brothers, and considerably less satiric verve.

i'll say one thing for herman, usa: it will probably always play well to minnesota audiences. i can't imagine that there's another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of bemidji or a line like "i knew there was something wrong with iowa guys" would bring down the house. i actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so. basically, a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors (is suitors a gender-specific word?). it ain't progressive, to be sure, but it's sorta charming in its own right. pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband. overall it's just too cloying for its own good, but you've got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with kevin chamberlin's build a nude love scene. i will always applaud the depiction of people who don't meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual, caring human beings, but that's not enough to redeem herman, usa. to paraphrase jello biafra, it's nostalgia for an age that never existed.

my mother took me to this movie at the drive-in when i was around seven years old, which is thirty years ago. she had no idea a family movie would be so violent. my clearest memory was of the boy's father's face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. this image haunted me for weeks. i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime. how could i stop them? how could my father protect himself? you must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven-year old. it is as real as witnessing an actual event, and has no place in a child's innocent mind. it is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society. if only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that they protect them from images of nudity and sex.

the story has little to do with jack london's original novel. i thought the acting was very unnatural, the dubbing was done very sloppily and the story itself contains a fairly large number of inconsistencies and loose ends. apart from that, the pace of the movie was horrendously slow at some parts.

this movie features roaches as super flesh eating killers. this may have been the first movie where roaches were the primary killers, though not the first movie where roaches are killers. "damnation alley" featured a scene with killer cockroaches and "creepshow" had a story that had them. in this one they are the star. not as good as it could have been this one doesn't have all that many kills in them. i could be wrong on that point, however, because i have not seen this one in quite some time. the roaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them. yes, she is quite strange as at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer roaches and she is like "they are biting my hand", and she says this in almost a state of ecstasy. there is also one super big roach near the end of this one, like in so many insect films. not a great movie, but worth checking out on a night you are bored out of your mind.

the book was one of stephen king's best. the movie was pure rubbish. it was painful to remain in the theater until the ending, which wasn't even the same as the book. i guess that this is the result when you try to cram 10 pages of story into every minute. there is no good reason to watch this movie.

needful things was one of my favorite stephen king books. but this movie is one of the worst book to film adaptations i have ever seen they changed so many things around that it made me sick. even the concept of the book being deception, things not always what they appear reminder throughout the book was not shown in the movie. althogh it was enjoyable as many stephen king films are, but as many stephen king films this one did not follow the book and became a piece of hollywood trailer trash. 2/10

reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock (needful things being the final part of the rock trilogy), and the plot was a variant on the "demon comes to small redneck village" type story king likes to tell. the characters were all described in loving detail, and it made both a good psychological and gory horror. the film on the other hand is awful. gone are the character interactions and clever plot, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile. if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this, else avoid at all costs, as with most films of king's books.

** may contain spoilers ** horrible. just horrible. i loved stephen king's novel, and this is just a horrible adaptation of it. they change the ending. they change the plot. they changed alan pangborne's character from a grieving husband to a happy fianc√©. if you are a fan of stephen king's novel, stay away. even if you are not, stay away.the book was awesomely dark, even for steve king. an 11 year old kills himself in the novel. a middle school principal is found with child pornography in the novel. this is nowhere near as good as the novel.this movie is my least favorite film of all time. i hate this film with a vengeance.

after the lush, inspiring aerial shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie, this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end.where to begin, well i'll start with the characters. i really enjoyed them in the book, here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had "victim" or "asshole" written on their foreheads from the get go. how any one didn't see through the store owner lealand gaunt (in a hammy and out of place performance by sydrow)is beyond me.this film lacks in thrills, suspense, and in some sense yes, entertaining values. it stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off. why introduce too many annoying should-die-quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through? in the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate. here, besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the fight between wilma and nettie), was a letdown and didn't have much balls. i'm sorry but after, one off screen death,a boring shoot off, and some bickering and then a couple explosions just didn't do it for me. the brutality and mean spiritedness from the book was sadly missing. the explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed, all of sudden the entire city was in a brawl? it made no sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way through suddenly are, who are these people and why should i care?the story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum. i thought ed harris and bonnie bedeila were good actors in this, but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn. amanda plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character)here it was a too one note. j.t. walsh was entertaining, but the role was far from interesting or layered. too predictable. the soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting. it stood out like sore thumb. easy there buddy, easy. something a little less theatrical i'd assume would have worked.i will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough i guess, the director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though. if your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hr point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of kings better novels.i often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously (ed harris speech at the end, or the character hugh priest in general), and was bored and uninterested most of the other time. personally the director should have done so much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie. the movie looks good, but not the look i think this story deserved. i mean, this dude helmed alaska,not a good sign. i'd rather just read the book, as you should too as if it is far more entertaining,layered character development, grisly violence and mayhem, a nasty sense of humour, and far more oomph. this is a butchered version, that has not much to offer. ** out of ****

took a very good book and completely butchered it. nothing was as it should have been. some of the best parts of the book were missing, including the major point of the whole book. simply the worst adaptation of a stephen king novel ever. this movie made the mini-series for it look good.

christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money. when i see his latest releases, i can believe that.beowulf is, all in all, in the "good" part of the crap movies : there are some good thrill scenes, indeed. the actors themselves aren't too bad. but the plot is silly, the "mortal kombat"-like music has nothing to do here, the ending is really s****y...really, the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was. i even wish i wasted my money on something else.

just once, i would like to see koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director, and producer! just once!this is a good attempt by jean leclerc and chris sarandon, and an even better attempt by victoria tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. the screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing koontz's work this way and the director...please.the story is a well-written story, but the screenplay is quite dull, unbelievable and horribly executed. the only elements which work are the performances by leclerc, sarandon, and tennant.on a personal note, i really wanted this to work. i adore koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing, and talent they deserve. if they put the same money into koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into king's, koontz would quickly rise above. but alas! without powerful people who believe in his work, i fear he will never get the chance.as an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total suck-fest. as a stand alone movie, it wasn't that bad, though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut. this movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. had they followed the original work by koontz, a bit more closely, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a far better endeavor.however, all i can manage to see in this, is how good it could have been, and wasn't.it rates a 4.3/10 from...the fiend :.

i actually saw the movie before i read the book. when i saw the movie i was upset because i wondered why dean koontz had made such a bad book/movie. the movie was confusing and didn't have a flow at all, it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the tv. i couldn't connect with the characters at all, so i didn't care about what happened to them(normally i love the characters because i can relate to their personality or problems). then i read the book and loved it. i often re-read the book, and the movie is collecting dust. i wish someone would make a koontz movie that follows the plot of his books, then the movies wouldn't suck so much. do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money!

unfortunately, koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. whispers follows the original book very closely, seemingly until the production company ran out of money. all of the sets in the first half of the movie were meticulously recreated from the book - something which has been lacking in many other koontz films. despite its other (numerous) downfalls, i continued to watch in anticipation of some really great scenery. wrong. by the time the detectives show up at the crack head's apartment (in the book), the movie is out of funds, and one of the most suspenseful scenes from the book, is ruined. where the book offered grisly discovery, a search and a chase through the guys apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the guys car.let's face it - koontz writes without a budget in mind, because imagination is free. if a koontz novel ever gets made into a decent movie, no one will go and see it, because they have been let down so many, many, many times before. this is why dean koontz's frankenstein is now just frankenstien - if you had seen your work butchered that many times, you'd get out early if it looked like happening again!

one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema. wait, i take that back-- this movie can't be included in any category related to "cinema"; it belongs in categories like "waste", turds, or similar categories. ironically, it's even _about_ two garbagemen. the movie is "men at work", a lightweight crime comedy starring the estevez (sheen) brothers from 1990. setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slapstick, continuity errors, and high rate of no-name actors never to be seen again, all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway (at its core, i mean). it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn every line, and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your *wasted* friends, thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade class.to make matters worse, i actually submitted an imdb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to the movie's imdb web page, if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yet(about the butthole surfer statue). i'm so conflicted about why i should even *waste* my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note, when what i really want to do is blow up emilio's acting career (no, wait, he's already done that himself. thanks, dude!) i'm so glad i *wasted* only time on this, not real money. for that matter, can i maybe have at least one tenth of their budget? anyone other than this director (emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars, carefully placing bikini-clad bimbos in the background, and beating up useless extras (henchmen) in haz-mat suits. i'd mention emilio's writing credit, but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay "writing" -- it's more like crayon-scrawled cartoon ideas. and charlie sheen, if you're reading this, i assume m.a.w. must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a coked-up, hooker-loving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet. (oops! sorry, i guess that part of your life isn't over yet. get well soon, you "half a man". such a promising talent, so *wasted*¬Ö oh look, there's that word again.)

i thought i had seen this film before as the plot summary sounded familiar. however, when i watched it one afternoon (in need of some mindless-but-amusing entertainment), i didn't recognise anything - if i had seen it before, i must have blocked the horror of it from my memory.this film is dreadful, and it shows its age. in fact, it looks older than it is: more like a mid-80s moronic comedy. whilst i am a fan of toilet humour and can see the funny side of many things, this is "comedy" at its most puerile and homophobic. the plot is as thin as a supermodel, which wouldn't bother me if only the film were funny.there is only one amusing line in the whole film, spoken by the character louis: "looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy!" in fact, louis is the only likable character (and that's not saying much). james and carl are the type of irritating, immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from, their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in iraq; the character of susan wilkins is colourless (looks like julia roberts, but lacks her charisma) and there is zero chemistry between her and carl - though it may be unfair to blame the actress, as i don't know what she could have done with such a poorly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable.there is good trash and bad trash. this is trash that definitely should not be recycled.

jesus franco is pretty hit or miss on his films & i'd say this was a miss, that is, unless you're into total sleaze. i will say that the man has an eye for a good shot, even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean. this is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible, but the acting is the least of what this is about. and what is it about? well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some. most notable (?) is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently amorous german shepherd, and while what's going on is merely implied (thankfully) it is probably a scenario that i could have done without. i'd rank this up there with tender flesh as one of the franco films i'd rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.

i am a fan of jess franco's bizarre style, and a lover even of his trashier films, and my personal opinion is that he has, besides several very entertaining movies, also created a few masterpieces, such as the brilliant "paroxismus" aka "venus in furs" of 1969, for example. it is, however, an undeniable fact that the 180+ movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career, also include a bunch of big time stinkers. "sadomania" of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers, just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity.sure, the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time. the only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is, generously spoken, slightly amusing.after couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island, they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns, wardens of a local prison camp. while the husband is banished from the island, the wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac magda and an extremely perverted governor. the prisoners are, of course, entirely hot chicks, most of them blondes, the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles.the plot, if one can call it that, is extremely stupid of course, but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway. the (only) interesting thing about "sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a 'women in prison' film. there are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top, the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really nasty.it is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so boring. the sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes i actually had a hard time not to fall asleep. it also makes me wonder why, out of all pornstars, jess franco chose ajita wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who had been born a man (well, maybe for exactly that reason). if you really want to watch this, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only (and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor). don't expect to be highly entertained, however, it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring. i am a jess franco fan and i always will be, but "sadomania" is just bad. 2/10

ok, no one will confuse this with citizen kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless. there are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. on the other hand i hope they didn't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. here's a prime example. after one of the captive girls dies: "this is terrible. it reminds me of the day zenobia died" "a relative?" "no, my favorite cow." i guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. i will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. i guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. i hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient. don't worry folks, it's on it's way.

truly awful. obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars craze, but there's no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage. the storyline gets lost before the middle, the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non-talent that all he does is pose for the camera. an alien planet they land on is actually the naval stockyards in long beach, california. this movie actually made me physically ill watching it.roger corman has made some good, some bad movies in his career, but there's no excuse for this one. 0/10 - imdb won't let you score a zero.

i've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years (not consecutively, of course). i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11, and it was so atrocious i almost walked out; i think i didn't realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended. anyway, it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up. i can finally give it the rating it deserves.1/10 (that was strangely satisfying)

this movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the star wars movies. the film uses recycled footage from "battle beyond the sars" which is another roger corman sci-fi turd, but atleast this one is better than "battle beyond the stars" - there is no real acting in this film (but its a roger corman film-what did you expect)again the entire soundtrack was done on a keyboard/synthasizer, the sound effects are recycled from "battlestar galactica" - there are no special effects because they were recycled/rearranged space scenes from another movie, the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage. --ironicaly, the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance, and he'd resurface again to star in the sylvester stallone movie "over the top" - i give this movie 3 stars out of 10

a roger corman rip-off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget. all of the special effects were originally used in "battle beyond the stars", and i suspect a fair amount of the props, costumes and sets were re-used from other sources as well. the story seems to have been written around these elements, so this isn't really a movie as much as it's a recycling project. third-rate "star wars" junk wasn't needed then or now.

as several posters have "hinted," this is a sorry "star wars" ripoff. now if you're going to rip off "star wars," at least do it right; "battlestar galactica" did, and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it, but this is definitely not one of them. david mendenhall, the juvenile lead, actually isn't too bad, though he goes overboard on the "cute" factor every so often. vince edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his "ben casey" days; if anything, he's even more wooden than he was ten. the other performances are nothing to write home about, either. even worse are the special effects; the best you can say about them is that they're lousy. it's glaringly obvious that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them, and the "battle" scenes between edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot. a very weak effort from roger corman. skip it.

it took me a few years to hunt down this title, a major staple of my childhood. almost every trip to the video shop i'd pick out space raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me. it was, i suppose, my star wars.it's a shame then that it's such a stinker. my memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so i had to take it at face value. a crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home.aimed squarely at the under-tens it's got unwelcome slapstick, very shoddy costumes and make-up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and poor acting. but even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult, where i can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no-brainer fun/powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful.i imagine as a kid i probably found it quite empowering - there are lots of "i can't do this, i'm just a kid" "sure you can kiddo, you just have to try!"-type exchanges; the kid drinks beer, etc., but even by low budget 1983 sci-fi standards this one's pretty awful, with a real snoozer of a "finale".

this one hardly compares to the space adventures of its time. those being star wars and star trek. and while i am no fan of star trek, i recognize that this film pales in comparison to the series trekkies ooze over. in fact, i would place back to the future in better light in terms of space and travel.the story is of a boy who is captured by space raiders (pirates). in a obviously fake and unentertaining battle, the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them. and slowly, one by one, those raiders die off. in the end, the boy gets to return home and the last remaining pirates escapes gravely wounded.the acting wasn't that great. but what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue, effects, and storyline. how they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me.if you want to take a shot at it because it involves space, go ahead. but be warned. "d"

if there were an epa for film, then this movie would get their most sincere approval. if we all recycled our "stuff" to this degree, we'd never run out of anything.funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw starwars i: the phantom menace. at least lucas didn't recycle his old footage.this is a dud. but it's a nice dud. cute in spots (i liked when the kid said, "damn rocks"). and, if you like explosions (even recycled ones) you will get your fill.actually for an obviously "no budget" film, it makes out fairly well. acting is weak, but there is a little characterisation here and there. story is predictable, but will lead you along anyhow.this is an "everybody chases the kid" type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences. i gave this one a 2 out of 10.i dug up my old vhs copy of this film. i don't think it's on dvd.

cheaply pieced together of recycled film footage, music and ideas, this film cannot really be called "well". but for me, when i watched it as a teenager, it was quite amusing. (i didn't know battle beyond the stars before.) in retrospect it has got something nostalgic, regarding the sf wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time. its trashy old-fashioned look and its naivety provide a certain attraction. to enjoy this movie i recommend to concentrate on the paternal relationship between the characters of vince edwards and david mendenhall. in addition, i liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discovers its heroic qualities after been unwillingly confronted with the challenge to take care of a child.

the acting is excellent in this film, with some great actors. it was fun to see fred mcmurray as a young man. this is not a comedy. it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful. this is not a comedy. it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful, and some of them appear forced and contrived. it's in the script, though, not the fault of the acting.the 10 line requirement forces me to write some more...hmmm. loved carole lombard's my man godfrey, because it is a comedy and, while the acting is wonderful, the story line and the script itself, wins the day. carole lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress. i will try to watch fred mcmurray's features.

oddly enough, it's fred macmurray who plays the more "screwy" part in this screwball comedy. carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness.as usual, fred macmurray remains a mystery to me. the camera is no fan of his, he's not that attractive, and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grant-like role.ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombard's character. one can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle, reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurray's ineptness. but that's hollywood!the picture almost works but misses the mark, primarily due to macmurray's performance. it would've been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role. lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable; macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length.

happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash-in on the success of american graffitti.there were some similarities between american graffitti and happy days.both opened with "rock around the clock" by bill haley & the comets. both took place in a bygone era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles. but there were also some major differences. while american graffitti took place in 1962 california and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood, happy days took place in milwaulkee, wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school, dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence.happy days originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of bill haley & the comets' rock around the clock. but when oldies became hot, thanks to the success of american graffitti, , and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock, entered the billboard hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went through the roof. so a "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly substituted.the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right.fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist. liberties were taken and details overlooked, making this show less than completely authentic.this is perfectly fine. happy days is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics. one episode centered around the cunninghams building of a fall out shelter. another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life. the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black (in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life). the issue of the draft even came up on a later episode!the show as originally set in 1955. one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast. most of them were teenagers and as each year passed, it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast, moving the series out of the safe waters of the eisenhower years into the age of camelot, all the way with jfk and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s. that, along with the writers running out of ideas, and later, cast members like ron howard leaving the series, wisely quitting while they were ahead, left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead. that, along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn't control themselves every time the great fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very thin very fast.this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era. time heals wounds, you know. everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the "original hit versions" over those "new stereo recordings", those "new stereo recordings" worked very well on happy days. and this is where i find myself regretting my buying the dvd! unlike the complete first season dvd, the original music on the complete second season, has been replaced with different music. while it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch!

"happy days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970's to the early 1980's and seems to get more ridiculous with age. at the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families, and the scenes at mel's diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle). richie cunningham was the all-american blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president. potsie was richie's best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend, i guess. and ralph malph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz, if not the entire group. i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph malph. and there was mel, the middle-aged lug who ran mel's diner. and of course who could forget the appearance of mork? was this really the 1950's? ironically, films produced during the 1950's, such as "rebel without a cause" and "the wild one" have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays.unfortunately, the tv show "happy days" is not in the same league as "rebel without a cause" or "american graffitti" for that matter. "happy days" may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its burger diner, juke boxes, cool cars, and tacky plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal. "american graffitti" had something to say about young americans in the 1950's whereas "happy days" seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like. the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950's. "happy days" is, at best, a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop. as pointed out by another reviewer, the all-american kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like fonzie. and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his diner.a quick history: "happy days" was originally a pilot called "love in the happy days" that was rejected for broadcast. comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show "love american style" which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and/or alterations. in short, "love american style" was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut. "love in the happy days" did appear as a "love american style" show sometime in the early 1970's, but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about 1950's young people would be popular, particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people, such as the "mary tyler moore show" (and its subsequent spin-offs such "rhoda"), "the bob newhart show", and "all in the family". (how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!) subsequently, one of the young stars of "love in the happy days", a child actor from "the andy griffith show" named ron howard, got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called "american graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous "thx 1138" had bombed miserably at the box office. even when it was premiered to movie executives, again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't "fit" with what had been popular in the past, although they didn't realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950's. as everyone knows, the movie was a huge hit, and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. somewhere during the theatrical run of "american graffitti", tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like "american graffitti". they brought it back with the original cast, plus henry wrinkler as "the fonz", re-titled it "happy days" and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's."happy days" now seems ridiculous. the characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than what they superficially are. the issues they deal with are trivial. and their reactions appear mindless and even silly. nowadays, the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, the fonz. was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brando's character in "the wild one"? looking on the show with fresh eyes, i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks. this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time. "american graffitti" has many of the outward appearances of "happy days" but it had an edge. it had an honesty about the characters and their issues. "happy days" took the look of "american graffitti" but failed to take its heart.

each year the company called nu produces couple of "action packed", "full of suspense" movies. this little nugget, called shadowcaster iii(until i visited this site i wasn't avare this is a whole trilogy), is a great example of the good job the company is doing. frank zagarino is as mean as always and does a great job as almost undestructable(?), schizophrenic(??) android. i won't waste any more words since i don't want to reveal the terrific plot and ruin you a couple of great laughs.rating 2/10 (revard for those hard working tehnicians. man, putting together this kind of rubbish must be nervewracking.)

as other reviews have said, another of the countless number of alien clones, this time with a great wodge of the terminator thrown in, add a bit of the classic sf story "who goes there?", and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from the andromeda strain (apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer 'droids unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them).ok, the story: after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a caption. "25 years later". the crew of a relay station orbiting mars, due to be relieved in 48 hours, detect a ginormous space ship on a collision course. it's the siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. not a good time to have taken everything useful off-line on the relay station to do some repairs then. the approaching ship doesn't deviate from its course and is broadcasting a "do not under any circumstances enter this ship!" warning. after a lot of shouting at each other, the crew of the relay station patch something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time. but the ship changes course and rams them any way - impaling one of the crew on a stick-outy pointy crew impaler thing. the satellite starts to "loose integrity". bits de-pressurise. lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards. (why are they always sucked out backwards?). after a few keystrokes the wheelchair bound techy (who is called 'wheeler' - the only only detectable joke in the whole movie) deduces that the siberia is draining them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its engines. they all go on-board and take their helmets off. "do not enter this ship!" obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases. one team head for the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy clutching what looks like an american express card but turns out to be a minidisc. the other team find some switches. amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a rampaging alien. they switch the engines off but this means the ships reactor will explode. a spooky point of view shot starts killing people. there's some guff about the siberia having discovered an new ore, a petential power source worth millions, which mean the more venal members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it. the pov shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! walking noises on the soundtrack. unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted.after that it's all just running around and getting killed in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive - along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths. just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie. other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the on-board computer (not that the low levels of oxygen in any way dampen any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start). if the killer droid id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight curve and have another go at ramming the relay station why didn't it turn off the "do not under any circumstances enter this ship!" warning signal.. i'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away! was not a good way of going about it.musetta vander is the only person who gets to do any acting - everyone else just flares their nostrils all the time while baring their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other. it that sort of script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off, or get wet while not wearing a lot. unfortunately it didn't. one of the things wrong with this movie (apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever) is that there was no gratuitous nudity.

this is so poor it's watchable.the plot deals with a grizzled spaceship crew happening upon a drifting, apparently abandoned russian craft.in the empty vastness of space, the two craft accidentally collide (!) - and 'alien'-esque fun ensues as a cyborg from the russian ship menaces our crew.the spacecraft interiors are clearly a dolled-up factory set (metal walkways, boilers, piping). in this entirely unconvincing setting, 'kody', 'snake' and the rest of our hero crew grimace, grunt, run about and continually and repeatedly rack their shotguns without firing them.the continuity gaffes are what define this movie, and they are nothing short of amazing:stuff appears and disappears. the shotguns are racked. a cigar gets longer by being smoked. the shotguns are racked again, just to make sure. content of a bottle increases by being drunk from.the film progresses through the usual clich√©s by way of intense ham acting, poxy camera work and ed wood quality props to a showdown climax.

well now this strange movie. it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at. actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film. oh here i go. alex ferns is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change, but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama. i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray. i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives. best avoided.

it was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (doesn't the time-clock stop for injured players or loss of helmets in texas football games?) and not so much redemption (so your dad beats the crap out of you? well, do something right for once and then he will love you and make it all worthwhile).either make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship or make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle but instead, this movie tried to do it all and came up more than a couple yards short. the book probably showed the whole story much better; the movie should have picked one element of the story and stuck with that.instead, the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashes of game play and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important--the qb calling his sibling to take care of the mother--whatever happened with that? because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game, does that mean she's not crazy anymore? its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack. buy that and then watch sportscenter highlights while iggy pop plays in the background.

we'll never know the truth about 9/11. and this shoddy movie proves it.i recently watched a youtube report claiming there were no planes involved in the twin towers' destruction; that all the news programs were supposedly provided with same-angle shots of the towers from a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?), and in that provided footage cgi planes were substituted for real-life missiles which actually hit the towers....it's a compelling video, and though i am not a wacko conspiracy theorist per se, i am still not sure myself whether actual planes hit anything that day (the towers, the shanksville field, the pentagon) - because there is no plane wreckage available. (and what about those infamous "black boxes"? none recovered.) a million other theories abound, all of them courting a droplet of truth awash in an ocean of speculation. but you'll drown in malarkey before you find anything truthful or worth speculating about in the 9/11 commission report, a no-budget movie that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped.writer-director leigh scott is obviously a concerned american citizen who wanted to enlighten audiences on what the 560-page report might reveal. it would help if his movie had actors, instead of a guy who looks like david duchovny, a chick who looks like gina gershon, a guy who thinks he's russell crowe and another guy who i'm pretty sure is trying hard to be sean bean. it would help if his camera operator didn't have parkinson's; if the lighting director wasn't trying to save on electricity; it would help if his editor didn't have attention deficit disorder, or if the soundtrack wasn't some tuneless new world order esoterica; and the looping should have probably been inserted when people were actually moving their mouths.we can't even call this propaganda. it's too funny. and by funny, i mean unwatchable.you can't squeeze an issue this complex into a two-hour film, but leigh scott tries anyway, including all those sexy catch-phrases we've grown inured to: bin laden's intent to attack, purchasing weapons from somalia, non-aggression agreement with iraq, mussawi attending flight school, weapons of mass destruction...the problem is: we know it's all retrospect, so every discussion the concerned intelligence operatives have with each other reeks of fake hindsight all crammed into a neat conversation. like contrived reverse engineering, everything pertinent is mentioned succinctly so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how incompetently all these branches of government screwed up.there's a ludicrous interrogation scene with a lubricious bimbo beating up on a guy with tomato sauce on his face. now - that would be considered torture if most guys didn't consider it a turn-on.the tagline is: "what if the attack could have been stopped?" by this movie's account - and, we presume, according to the commission report - the cia and other underground agencies were all set to capture bin laden and didn't. everyone involved with the "terrorism" reports (you mean you actually read these reports?) is so concerned we just want to slap them for their bad acting.yet the whole story goes so much deeper than the banal soundbytes the negligent ku bush klan foisted on the american people after 9/11. we now know that even capturing bin laden before the 9/11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels were in motion with or without that taliban figurehead whose involvement was the possible figment of someone's fevered imagination to unite america against a common enemy. contrary to popular belief "they" didn't "attack us." as ron paul tried to elucidate, it was a case of middle eastern blowback - "they" were so sick of america planting their infidel feet "over there" that they brought the war "over here." so though george w. death likes to tout the nonsensical, "we're fighting them over there so we won't have to fight them over here," in reality "because we're over there, the fight has been brought over here." the 9/11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists, as it was the gross negligence of the bush administration, who we know (without the probing of commissions) had all the intel from the clinton administration onwards; information about terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. but the oil idiot of texas, who refused to read his daily briefings and would rather vacation at his crawford ranch than spend one extra day at work, abrogated the duty he swore an oath to perform - protect the american public.and then the scum who called himself president used the attacks brought about by his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed-down countryfolk to score a second term, shred the american constitution and take america into a fake war on the basis of a lie (wmd), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. strangely enough, the movie never treads near the ku bush klan, offering no opinion or judgment, leigh scott wanting to remain neutral. tell that to the raped and pillaged hundreds of thousands in the fake war on terror in iraq.out of pure coincidence, i realized i was watching this dvd while wearing my "bush lied. thousands died." t-shirt.

am i the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence? i knew nothing about leigh scott when i rented it, and would not have done so if i had known that most of his previous films were horror films. i am not into that at all, i was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.instead, i got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. the only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.i wrote this because i am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on tv, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that i read.

this documentary was very amateurish. it could have been made by college students. assuming that it was, my grading is as follows. content : c, sound quality : f ,cinematography : f ,acting : d, soundtrack : f, casting : c, boobshot : a ......overall grade :di found myself getting seasick as we walked down the streets with the characters,bobbing up and down with each move of the cameraman'step.my mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear and she could not hear the muffled dialog. extensive post production editing and cgi would not help this bomb. these students would "barely" pass my course.my advise...don't waste your time or money for the one "a".

i saw this in the theatre a couple decades ago, and fuzzy recollection suggests that i liked it. however, seeing it for a second time two things stand out: (1) very poor acting on the part of michelle johnson, and (2) very poor music throughout.it's not that all the music was bad. some of the brazilian music was fine, but the theme song and others that clanged their way in were reminiscent of the worst of '80s pop music.johnson's voice seemed all wrong, possibly dubbed. this was distracting.on the positive side: (1) the story's not bad, (2) it's interesting seeing such a young demi moore, (3) valerie harper never looked better, and (4) johnson did look quite fetching in various stages of disattire.

this movie should be called blame it on the script. directed by stanley donen, of singin' in the rain fame, this celluloid mid-life crisis is not all bad. it's got some lush scenes of rio de janeiro and various scantily clad extras cavorting with each other and romping around the beach to the sultry sounds of samba, but there is just something about watching fifty-something michael caine get it on with whiny teenager michelle johnson that makes you feel...well, sleazy. this storyline is a complete stretch, too. nobody but pervy and vain old studio execs in hollywood could have green-lit this embarrassment. maybe they are so used to having young bimbos as arm candy that they forget it's their fat wallets that hold the key to their appeal, not their huge larry king-style spectacles and yellow cigar-stained teeth. it's one thing for a nubile young sexpot to have a crush on an older man, but on her best friend's father who happens to be married? and then to throw herself at him shamelessly? ugh! there's nothing entertaining about that. it's rather pathetic and grotesque. take note of a young demi moore's budding *cough* talent.

not the funniest movie ever.....but i have to watch this film at least once a year just so i can fall in love with michelle johnson all over again. she never looked better than she did in this film. by the way the story is good too.

all in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, this will do that for sure. the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons:#1. michael caine#2. the people, the sights, the culture and the music of brazil the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-believable story. even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short. michael caine is pure class, as always. besides being a gifted classical and comic actor, caine brings a blend of introspection, mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfie...and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later. in this farce, he is tenderly beguiling...funny and vulnerable... melancholy and sentimental....and besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro, the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment.well...maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses, michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason. but look is all you can do at michelle (though her look seems sorely dated)....there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her "try" to act (most of her dialogue seems overdubbed, too). demi's acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her, as is, into any movie today (she doesn't really look much different to be honest). ms. moore is surely underused, especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2. save the fact that it is a silly farce, at the end, i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation...that it doesn't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair, even with the underage daughter of your best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can move on. the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired, but all works out for the best....a bit unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. hope always is.

"blame it on rio" is a romantic comedy 80's style, with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running time.the plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect. both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic rio de janeiro, each with a daughter at their side. complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter.this potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines, however it never really becomes hilarious, as it could have. any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either, and perhaps director donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation.not a bad film, but what really ruins it is michelle johnson's awful performance as the naughty little temptress jennifer. while she uses her body to full advantage, it's the only thing she's got. michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. no wonder we haven't seen her in anything else.friday, january 7, 1994 - video

i just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors. i really don't understand where all the positive reviews came from -- the animation is clunky and unrefined, the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint, and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film. i have never read the book so i can't say if the movie was faithful, but as with most movie adaptations, it tries too hard to cram as much information into the shortest amount of time possible. the result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that doesn't really let you understand or relate to the characters, or, actually, anything at all. overall, i felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where i couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to them, and the only way i can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a scooby-doo cartoon.

this takes place on fire island back in the 1970s. a couple peter (craig dudley) and buddy (j. will deane) are throwing a 4th of july party at their house. unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests. the rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between peter and buddy.ok--i'm a gay man but i was 8 back when this was made. if this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s, i'm glad i wasn't around. from the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand (???) this movie slides slowly into disaster. there's a guru (robert case) who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance. i wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first long speech. there's the young kid danny who is there for his first time. there's the lesbian couple (who do nothing--except one strips for no reason). there's the leather queen. worst of all is the effeminate man named jimmy (jimmy foster). we're introduced to him and his friend (whose name i never got) when they get a flat tire. they basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix a flat. i know some people find this funny but i found it offensive and pretty sad. the party itself is full of people you would never want to know. it's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people. with the sole exception of dudley no one can act.this may be valuable as a portrait of what fire island was like in the 1970s...but it's pretty dull viewing. this gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies.

bathebo, you big dope.this is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time. i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch. really painful. how does something like this get made?? horrible, horrible, horrible! oooooo ..... the toilet is flushing by itself again! scary toilet! scary toilet! scary toilet! 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me, but watching this makes it seem like 1952. i mean its horrible. please don't waste your time on the drivel!scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard. scary! scary! how does this stuff get made???

a couple move into their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery. the film is said to have been based on a true story, although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed. the plot is hardly unique - see spielberg's 'poltergeist' (1982). within a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control. there is little depth to the story: once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. the plot does not seem to develop. the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable, nor is the atmosphere particularly special. the film could be disturbing to some viewers. there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.

so, this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea, goes on and on with tension, carey in a good untypical role but in a less than you expected performance, weak direction from joel schumacher match with some plot holes, the "detective scenes" show us the luck of creativity. if you don't have great expectations (because of the negative reviews) maybe you will enjoy this . at the end they offer to us a lesson about morality (for those who remember "falling down") and the "family joy and cure" that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable p.s. it's obvious who is the "killer"! i wonder why w.sparrow (carey) didn't resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film...

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i didn't go in with high expectations, but as soon as it started i thought it might be o-k. it wasn't. jim carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as though he were some diabolic cartoon character. the other actors all seem to try their best but are kind of wooden. the plot has a good basis, but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid. i was laughing during the whole second half of the movie, and after five minutes of that i got tired of that. most plot 'twists' you could see from several miles off. it's just not worth watching. i really wish i hadn't wasted my time with it.

one would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. and sure, it's an interesting subject - can a person become so obsessed by something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? well, perhaps someone will make a movie about that sometime. this one unfortunately doesn't have anything to do with the above, never mind what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. i would like to say that this number is just a macguffin, but it isn't even that. it's pointless. a gimmick. a hook for unsuspecting audience.well what is the movie about? a dog-catcher (carrey) who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. there. sure, the character in the book - detective fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts seeing the number everywhere.. but it's just padding, and totally irrelevant to the story. in fact, you can cut out all the 23 references and have the main character(s) obsess about cheese or something and you'll have the exactly same story. it is painfully obvious that all the "23" stuff was written in waay after the story was already finished, rejected and sent for "rewrites".which would be ok.. i guess.. if the movie wasn't dull, dull, dull. half of the movie is narrated, for chrissakes. you aren't watching the movie, you are listening to jim carrey narrating the movie. about a quarter-in carrey starts reading the book, and from then until the horribly clich√© ending we are forced to watch "real-life" scenes from dog-catcher's life (where nothing happens) interspersed with narrated artsy film noir-ish "book" scenes which will either leave you snickering or just plain depressed. it's like a poor man's "sin city" with all the violence cut out, narrated by carrey and shown in slow-motion. ugh.this is a simple case of a c-movie script somehow being filmed with an a-movie cast.. probably because of the "number 23" hook which i guess sounded intriguing enough on paper to warrant the premium hollywood treatment. however, since - as i said already - the movie is about number 23 as much as it is about cheese production in switzerland, one cannot feel anything but cheated.i give "fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10, because i guess it didn't insult my intelligence as much as "forsaken" did or made me downright suicidal like "battlefield earth" did and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations like those. but fear not, this is still a pretty lousy flick.

there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors. back in the late 80's and early 90's, when his name was attached to several great films like "the lost boys", "flatliners" and "falling down", he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood. then came the stupid "batman" sequels, unfortunately, and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumacher's hands. both "8mm" and "phone booth" could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of "the number 23" should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie. literally from start to finish, "the number 23" desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clich√©s from the big book of cinema history, including heavy-voiced narration, flashbacks, disorderly structure, characters with multiple personalities, numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings. nothing helps, however, simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew. as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open-minded regarding the insane theories, this still remains a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers aren't scary. walter sparrow (jim carrey in a rare non-comical role) is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23. walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book's protagonist (a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide) and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life. i did some research on google and wikipedia and, apparently, this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number. well, that's just ¬Ö crazy! but hey, i'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, regardless of how demented they are, and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out-and-out berserk enigma. "the number 23" is not suspenseful, in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make-up effects, and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life. all cast members perform below their normal capacities, but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs. virginia madsen in a relatively big production again. definitely not recommended in case you're looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun, but endurable and not entirely without merit.

the movie starts good, it has a thing going for it. about 1/3 into the movie things go downhill. carrey starts obsessing about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. so what? thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls.the acting by whoever is playing his son is bad. from the get-go, as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession, he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it. totally unbelievable. i hope i never see this kid in another movie again.its a waste of time watching this movie. grab another. boring piece of ... well. the number is killing him? give me a break. i won't spoil the ending for you, but let's just say it is equally disappointing.3 / 10.

not just because of that theme in the movie. which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. no.i watched this, knowing i would not like it. i hate numerology. whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers i feel the urge to slap them. my own brain starts hurting out of empathy. and fully aware this is a movie just about that topic, i couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh. but it wasn't funny. just exactly the dumb sort of "isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool?! i can turn any crap into 23!" dialog i was afraid of. as soon as the son started to chime in, i knew this movie is a turd, no matter what happens. but i hardly ever stop watching a movie i started. i sat through it. i enjoy the pain.the movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. but it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it. i don't see that message. i only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify. top that off with the usual "surprises" - trying to put another twist to throw you off, that makes no sense, and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there - and you get one hollow piece of movie-making. that just happens to be centered around the topic i despise. if only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors i don't give a damn about. but i was starting to like carrey...while it's not his fault, he is trying. it's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it.my expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them, but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst i've ever seen.

what the hell was this? i'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere he goes, but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell?! for crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller i would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get? we just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. kinda like an old-man flick if you ask me. i probably should have just rented wild hogs, it wouldn't have made a difference. i mean who are we kidding, they should have made someone else the killer of that girl. by juxtaposing sparrow with the protagonist of that book the number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along. how would that have shaken our heads? shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who concurred with my reaction.

** out of **** starslet's see...14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23, which was my departed grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 minutes past the 23rd hour. assign the number any way you choose and ooh be very scared. be extremely scared when you throw in a brain-dead looking mutt to go with 23, and you have schumacher's latest attempt at a dark suspense fest with the number 23. oh yeah, 23 is also my record in cuervo shots at my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state in the union.carrey carries the film to about it's halfway point, then we lose sight of him, not caring much. don't look for any crazy expressions to come from the comedian carrey, as you have seen in the mask and me, myself and irene. no. and don't expect an embodiment of a character as he did with andy kaufman. this role is a sad and peculiar devolvement for jimbo. where's the riddler when you need him! i know, we don't need him. virginia madsen, like usual, is underused as the supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. her talent, like carrey's, is suppressed, and it's almost painful to watch her try to rescue her underdeveloped character from near anonymity. to give credit where credit is due, there are a couple of interesting scenes in the number 23 that showcase some very crafty cinematography. they are arresting enough on their own without having to be convoluted within the incoherent narrative of this silly story.i don't know about you, (and i realize this is a work of absolute fiction) but i don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a dank, dark basement, or spends his time at graveyards on a regular basis like carrey does in this movie. schumacher keeps his film dark and blood-red and gloomy and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and dank and on and on and on from beginning to end. even flatliners and the lost boys had a little more daylight in them, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires!if you feel like watching this film, even if it's out of mere curiosity...make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 catnaps, that way you can kill 23 birds with one stone.

the goodcarrey is good actor and he proved it in "man on the moon" and in "eternal sunshine of the spotless mind". but hey, what can an actor do without good story and proper directing. he can do "number 23".the bad joel schumacher is poor, overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie he made. what he did with batman is just disaster, but probably batman movies supposed to look good. well, they didn't. instead of gothic and macabre we got disneyland. sure "falling down" was great but can you ruin the film with robert duvall and michael douglas and with excellent script? no you can't. and so good actor and poor director finally met and made "number 23"...the ugly (23)i know that it's stupid to begin with but... fingerling's subplot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like intro to another chapter of max payne2. voiceovers, quality of detective story itself, quality of the characters, even colors, mood and music, editing, and sound mix too! perhaps it works for the game, but surely it doesn't in the cinema.mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny. it's not even annoying. carrey reads walking down the stairs in park? why? is it natural? no, but it looks good. why suicide blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper? if she just wanted to kill herself? there is no logic in that, but still it looks good. guess what it, it doesn't look good at all. it looks unnatural instead. all female characters are flat. why is that so? who cares, let's go on with the story.who is this fingerling? private eye on the suicide? hardly believable.scenes when walter sparrow is arguing with his wife about weather book is really about him could be the best part of this movie. instead we get moulder/scully routine. disappointment. interiors has no sign of people living in them, except the significant objects (shoes, photos etc.) hard luck.dialogs ain't that bad. but what about v.o.? well that's another story. "there's no such thing as destiny. there are only different choices". captain obvious to the rescue! "number was coming after fingerling. and now it was coming after me". clich√©. and so on.it's obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night. successfully and undisturbed.the subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard. this is so old trick and so comfortable for writer, and that it should have been banned. i mean it!flashbacks and editing similar to "what happened in last episode of x-files" isn't the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. is it?i wish i could say that this story deserves a better fate, but it doesn't. it makes no sense. told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable. all the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction. this could be fun, but - since whole movie is dead serious - it isn't. to many coincidences is just bad for every story. and the "mystery"? it's predictable and easy to guess. losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie, but i never saw any of that in hollywood's productions. if you're interested in the subject just watch "repulsion" by polanski or something by david cronenberg, "spider" or "a history of violence" both of that movies deals with similar problems that "number 23" wanted to show. wanted, but failed.

"fate" leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. as the story unfolds in real life and fiction, sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. the second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. he has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. he switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. the actual book in the film that's titled "the number 23" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. when carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. at this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston. overall, the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. rating 3/10

this is the most stupid movie ever made. the story is laughable. his wife and kid think he's insane. then they don't. then it turns out he is and i think they knew it all along. there is a dog named ned that causes some problems and i think it's all his fault...so does jim carey. god only knows why virginia madsen took this role...this is a career sinker. i think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds. and that adds up to 23. or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23. or maybe it's for really dumb 23 year olds. or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because that's 23 in reverse. or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23. i think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie, unless you wanted to see a comedy.

apparently, a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies, turning a murderous sociopath into a lovable and oafish dog catcher. also (this ones for the ladies), it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot for meeting potential mates. those are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities we're supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning. i love movies and i believed, as i'm assuming many americans do (forgive me if i'm wrong), that hollywood turned out the best product. i've come to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed i was and 2) how much more sophisticated european/asian cinema is in comparison to its american counterpart.i watched this allegedly disturbing psychological "thriller" the night following a viewing of a japanese movie called suicide club. as the camera faded on walter sparrow's happy little family enjoying some quality time around a prison visiting room table (not to mention the patronizing voice-over extolling the virtue of "doing the right thing"), i suddenly had an epiphany. i had just finished watching a movie that left me feeling as though i'd just had a glass of water when i really wanted a beer. my thirst was sated, but it was strictly utilitarian. the premise was mildly interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable "coincidences" (how do we explain her finding the book? we'll just say something like,"...or did the book find her?." they'll buy that), gaping plot holes (why did wifey take the skeleton?), predictability, and obligatory happy ending, turned out to be just another hollywood hack job. additionally, the casting of jim carrey was just¬Öwrong. at any moment, i felt he was capable of breaking into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or in living color. jim carrey as a tattooed hard-boiled police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex? didn't buy it for a second.you want disturbing? deeply disturbing? watch suicide club. the story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls. the film opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling about on a subway train platform. we then watch in horror as they line up, hold hands, and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving commuter train. needless to say, much chaos ensues. that's as far as i'm going to go with the story line because i encourage the reader to see the film. in fact, i'm not sure if i could outline the plot even if i wanted to. what begins as a straightforward mystery quickly descends into a madhouse of grotesque imagery. did i understand the movie? no¬Önot initially¬Ölike many of the foreign films my girlfriend has introduced me to. so naturally, i thought it was "bad." but this one lingered in my mind. i went to bed thinking on the film and awoke the next morning and looked it up on imdb. i read some of the viewer comments and was astonished at 1) the insights others had derived from the film and 2) the fact that i had so thoroughly missed the whole point of the movie. i realized that i was so used to being spoon fed the "message" from hollywood, that when confronted with a film that actually required the viewer to participate¬Öto actually think for themselves, i was totally unequipped. it's as if i had been conditioned to "check my brain at the door" of the theater.am i saying that suicide club is the greatest movie ever made? of course not. it has its flaws, many of which were reported adroitly by the imdb reviewers. am i saying that all american movies are bad and all foreign movies are good? again¬Öof course not. my point is that there's a whole world of film-making outside of hollywood¬Öa body of work that engages the viewer; forces them to think and question¬Ömovies that don't telegraph plot twists, follow a strict linear sequence, and above all, don't insult the intelligence of the person watching. i look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world of film that doesn't "do the thinking for me."

this movie has no respect for the viewer's time. it takes a 15 minute story and stretches it into 95 minutes. in order to achieve this, they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst. by the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot, i just didn't care. the problem is not in the acting, but instead the pacing. the story is just weak. jim carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role is just out of place. his style of humor is not generic, so he comes across as a watered down version of himself. the number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story, but the justification for this is never logical. at most it's just mildly interesting. jim carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals. don't waste your money seeing this in the theater. rent this movie if you've had problems sleeping. if you are still wide awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it more than i did. i was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either. a lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to enhance the already weak story.

in a word, god-awful... too many plot holes.. um, yeah... who takes their kid to dig up a dead body in the middle of the night? and what's up with his wife stealing the skeleton.. who does that? why, exactly did the shrink stab himself in the neck? and that whole dog thing.. i mean, really! having sparrow narrate from the beginning also just completely destroyed the suspense for me.. i mean, if he's narrating the story, clearly he's lived to tell it, so there's no chance of him getting offed.. where's the suspense there? of course, you expect plot holes in a film like this. but, there are so many i lost track of the story completely because of them. what kind of name is fingerling? or toppsy? why did the wife dig up the body? (who does that?) or go into that crazy spooky asylum alone? and where'd all those candles come from? why does the writer have his po box in the freaking book??? i mean come on... and the book just happens to find its way to the bookstore next door to the wife's bakery?? way too convenient... oh and happy birthday honey, here's a book about a serial killer.. what a thoughtful gift! the book is like 20 pages long, half of which are blank, and it takes him freaking forever to read it. if he's truly obsessed with this book, wouldn't he have read it all in one shot?a bit convenient for him to bump into his future wife (carrying a cake!) about 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital.. how old was he playing? 36?? was i the only one at the end rooting for the bus to actually run the guy down? not good when you're rooting for the protagonist to bite it in the end.it seems like this was written by committee.. i imagine that the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23... it seems as if they needed a gimmicky hook to bait the audience into thinking there was some supernatural thing going on, when in the end it really didn't seem to have anything to do with anything. i mean, i wasn't expecting the godfather or anything, but everything about this film was a total let-down. without all the numerology stuff, this movie could actually have been ok, instead of some hackneyed se7en knockoff.not scary, unintentionally hilarious and otherwise a total snoozer.

this is the worst work ever of daniel day lewis..... i can not believe that in the same year he made this awful movie and my left foot..... please stay away from this movie....this is a movie only for argentine people as a curiosity... the plot is impossible to understand...... the writer thinks that in argentine all the people speaks in english... of course the patagonia bring a very good frame for the photo shooting of the film, but that is not enough reason to see this movie.... i repeat , only if you are very fan of daniel day lewis, or if you want to see the south of argentine, part of the patagonia, and you do not have enough money to travel yourself.......

this quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of patagonia. hailing from northern ireland, via new jersey, the main character, fergus, sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist. which adds to the hilarity, as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the patagonian outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his, er, mobile dental unit. we never get to meet his wife, nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill-fated mission, but, we do get a solid display from lewis. fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is gallantly adored by the, innocent but sexy, 18 year old female lead who tags along on for the *ahem* ride.this film is not for everyone and i can understand why it wasn't pushed by the suits. it's a low budget, sometimes charming, always disarming, mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds.

was a college acting class exercise filmed and released as a movie? the formulaic posturing and stylized drivel of a "horror" soap opera for people who don't like horror films but wish to be able to tell that friends that, yes, they did see a horror movie. it even features soap opera music.do books falling off library shelves scare you? do doors shutting terrify you? then this flick is for you. have you ever been kidnapped? yeah, most of us have. when you were raped, was it simply ignored, because the rapist was the cool kid? what's scary is not this movie but this filmmaker's view of the world. and then the little twists aren't even original. this is a film for people who've never seen a horror film before, who don't want to see one now, and who want to see another flick about everyone conspiring against the weird kid.

years ago, sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did i mention she has an imaginary friend?) this film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. deathly boring, i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed 'mystery'. is sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? a better question would be, who cares? and the answer to that, no one. no one at all. skip this film, save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks.my grade: d-

good lord! this movie needs to have a new classification on its cover "watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!". i am disappointed. i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine. but this movie didn't do it. a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming. it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly. we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clich√©s like "i just need you to hold me" in the totally wrong places and situations. thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if i'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.

if you see this film in the tv listings just ignore it. if you're looking for something scary you'll be better off watching reruns of the x-files.previous comments referencing the incredibly poor acting by the female lead are dead on. she is almost unwatchable. the sum total of her range includes 'whiny and scared' and 'whiny and not scared'.i am the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good 'bad' movie. but this is ridiculous. there is no direction. the plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers, it ends up having no meaning in the end.your time will be better spent if you turn off the tv and give your dog a bath.

let's get one thing straight; this was bad! so putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories.the ever repeating storyline (who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances.) a typical storyline goes as follows; sue (the mother) opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful (as if that doesn't get old! har-de-bloody-har!), some australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" -look it up- appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything/everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a small mercy)the rest of the plot revolves around the father (gary) getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out.the phrase "words fail me" is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say. it is so incredibly bad! so horrible, that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on.it saddens me though, to see someone as good as sally bretton (good actress, i like her) make a prat out of herself, ardal o hanlon (my hero aside) has the ability to be pretty funny - but not here - and ben elton, distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this...thing then comedy is in very serious trouble!

....and now i'm up to episode #7. i really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled, once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series really is dire. to have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! it's so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad, maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. in some episodes i haven't even laughed once!oh, and i can't believe ardal o'hanlon actually stopped doing 'my hero' & started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'blessed' were. don't get me wrong, 'my hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk.and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well, when there are so many great tv series' that aren't getting released!

i have seen this movie but not in a single sitting. what happens it that it is playing on the tv, i watch for a few minutes, find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room. during those few minutes i do not laugh once, experience no pleasure in what i am viewing, and find myself more depressed that angry. interestingly, i am told the psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. this movie tests that theory.i think part of the problem is that i spent nearly ten years in chicago so as i am watching the scenes i am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus i am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. it is entirely possible, i am willing to concede, that if you are not a chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. if so, i envy you.and yet. john hughes set his films in chicago and those movies worked for me. i think the difference is that hughes was a first rate writer. i think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations, as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. in a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. and it is not easy to achieve. if it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. in "adventures in babysitting," it doesn't. i hated those characters. there is a difference, profound and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic.for me every scene in this movie is a clunker. there is no humor, no humanity, no people one can recognize. just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out, certain that finally hilarity will ensue, this time for sure! it's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. it's embarrassing and after a while, usually at the point when i get up and leave, i start to feel pity for all concerned, which is a kind of emotional connection, i suppose. elizabeth shue is terrible. she doesn't act, certainly not act comically, and it's entirely possible she can't. but lord how she tries. she looks older than 17, and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. and she is not alone. it is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. now, this was an early effort for chris columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. john hughes himself) certainly helped, so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. but the film just reeks of desperation. yet like i said it may work for some. if any of the above appeals to you, and it clearly did some of the reviewers, then go get the dvd and knock yourself out. otherwise, avoid this mess like you would a dark chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.

this movie was a complete disaster for me. there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable, and that is *some* psychological credibility of characters... unfortunately, here, this is not the case. the main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have some reason for such behavior, it is not revealed to us by the director. sophie marceau's character is particularly irritating, making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie, when one could expect something more rational (for example meeting with her mother in the hospital)... and why exactly did she marry this guy? (no, this is not a spoiler) the plot at times seems like ripped off some soap-opera, and while the actors' performance is not bad, this does not help much. all in all, i just could not find a way to connect with this movie. not that i tried too much after the first hour, though. i have never walked out of cinema during a movie, but this time was the closest in my life so far.

this is a movie that should have been a mini-series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space. the whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub-plots, character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere. there is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl, she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real. they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband. with that said there are no less than 1000 sub-plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. in the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring. you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer. after a half-hour, and completely disinterested, i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off. the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.

having broken into a secret database file for matching dna serums,federal agent frank poo (andy garcia)discovers the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath,played by michael keaton . however,when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong,a certain mr.poo has to do everything in his power to ensure the madman stays alive in order to make the inevitable transfer possible. by the way,his name is'nt really poo,i just feel like calling it him. despite the original concept at hand,this is an implausible and turgidly unexciting action thriller.i've never been a big fan of andy garcia,and granted his charecter here is'nt that attachable,this movie winds up all the worse.the action sequences are handled pretty disappointingly,and the ending sucks pretty bad. having done a great villain in pacific heights,keaton's psychopathic bad guy here is a let down,providing a madman too funny and charismatic to be deplored.brian cox is also wasted as garcia's firm and frank superior.

this is one of those movies where i was rooting for whoever could end the movie the quickest. i wanted to see the cops kill keaton and garcia just to get it over with. basically, this is the deal--two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer keaton. is it worth it? no!

this movie is absurd. absolutely terrible. michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie. the plot is totally not believable! michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but then escapes. he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital. he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital, blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge (why?). and to top that andy garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow. the plot is such baloney! maybe the worse movie i have ever see.

i can't believe i watched this whole movie. another "ishtar" in that i kept waiting for it to get better, which never happened. the sound is terrible, going from too low to hear the conversations, to blaring sound in seconds. the plot is absolutely implausible, the acting is mediocre, although keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although being typecast in that role could certainly be considered a negative. the director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medications, science or anything of a technical nature. "sociopath"???? i wonder how they came up with that diagnosis? there are so many errors, goofs and things wrong with this movie that if one were to list them all it would possibly set some kind of record. demerol as a general anestetic? a motorcyclist on the freeway wearing a non dot/snell off-road helmet. san francisco??? paper walls move when tapped, helmets just appear out of thin air, guns point one direction but hit things in another, lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a scene in the move that doesn't contain some kind of error. my wife, who is an rn in an oncology unit finally left the room before the end of the movie so upset over all the medical errors. i gave it a 2 only because of keaton's acting, else it certainly would have gotten a 1.

i really wanted to see this film - i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. a cop (andy garcia) has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. the only match is a convicted serial killer, who escapes from jail. to save his son he has to track down the killer.michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film. keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring. it's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring.garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par. barbet schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like "barfly" that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market) directs well enough - i honestly thought the script was the culprit here...it's just a big mess.the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. what should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just a hollywood action dud.

well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. to summarize things up, cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(michael keaton).well criminal agrees but escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son).well, the police in this movie doesn't have a brain, in case they never heard of a tazer to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie, as simple as that.but it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly.

they give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase. the main characters are involved in one constant stand-off where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. and i'd like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the a. garcia bit. it's like some local cop walking charlie manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee. get real!

i haven't seen ishtar, but i did have the misfortune of seeing kevin costner's postman, this is worse. maybe the absolute worse piece of garbage i have ever seen, and if you look at my review for moulin rouge? that is saying something. bad plot, acting was substandard and even wasted (even though, yes, michael keaton has been in some of the worst movies i have ever seen), and this movie has no redeeming value to anybody with more than half a brain. do not see if you have graduated the 4th grade as you will find this an insult to your intelligence.

this plot had more holes in it than an oj simpson alibi! i noticed two star trek references in the movie and, yet,ironically we have a lead character played by andy garciawho is the antithesis of the vulcan philosophy of, "theneeds of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one." let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of san francisco at incredible risk. michael keaton's character is almost asunrealistic as well. he neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when garcia foils hisattempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. the child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after beenheld hostage several times in a short expanse of time butput her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it. andy garcia's child is something of an anathema in thismovie. he is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the movie's bright spots. he furthermore utters a line, that must have been the result of serendipity, regarding fighting cancer that parallels keaton's motivation to escape. all in all, the movie was not acomplete waste (see from dusk to dawn 2: texas blood moneyfor that) but disappointing considering the talent on hand.

this movie, "desperate measures", was.... i'm not quite sure how to even put it into words. was this supposed to be a comedy? i couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was. i love michael keaton, and i cannot actually comprehend that he did this. they did a good job at keeping my attention because i couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to get minute by minute. i actually just registered on this site so that i could get this out. i don't review movies. i don't have time for this, but i cannot let this go knowing i haven't done my civil duty by letting people (those who have an iq of 85 and above) know that this is no action/thriller, it is honest to goodness funny. you people that actually got thrills off of this scare me. go watch a good movie like million dollar baby. clint eastwood's acting is not superb, but i was balling at the end. exercise your brain america!

exceptionally bad! i don't expect much from garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today but keaton really should have known this movie would suck and gotten out while he could (not that i'm especially fond of him but hey, he did batman).in one scene keaton is transported to a hospital chained down and wearing a hannibal lecter kind of face mask when two attack dogs bark at him (dogs can sense evil you know (puke)) and keaton growls back at them making them back off and whine with their tails between their legs. did the movie turn comedy right there? garcia makes a fool out of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogue only a complete retard could find plausible and the kid is too annoying to feel sorry for..if you are gonna make a movie with as poor a plot as this you need some charm, humour, some solid action. take die hard for example which is great despite its rather crappy plot.even though keatons character was a joke i routed for him all the way. i wanted to see garcia cry over his dead kid and keaton sipping martinis on some paradise island, however! this movie makes for a good laugh.. watch it with a witty friend and you can have some fun as this movie begs for wisecracks in almost every scene. all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. greed made this movie and thank god it bit its own ass.

words can scarcely describe this movie. loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a silly plot, and poor music, this movie lacks in just about every category.don't be fooled by the imdb credits. this is not a michael dorn movie. he's a secondary character in the grand scheme.also listed in the credit's is an actor named "prince" - which makes me wonder if it's the same artist formerly known as.... then again, i'm not sure this movie is worth watching just for that.big summary... bunch of teams... one has kidneys... one has $35,000.... one has an "illegal substance".... and one has $350,000. add some confusion and mixups as to who needs to meet who, revenge on being taken, and such, and you end up with this mess of a movie.given a choice, i'd pass on this movie.

i watched "gristle" primarily for the presence of michael dorn, as i enjoyed his worf portrayal on star trek tng, but had never seen him out of his makeup. dorn appears to have a nice presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. this movie, however, gave him little dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can, indeed, use the "f" word.it appears that this movie was made by someone who fancied himself as a forward-thinking type, with a social conscience. yeah--- for 1965. today, the themes are so belabored and sophomoric and cornball that even spike lee's dreadful "bamboozled" looks good in comparison.this crime-caper flick has an intricate labrynth of double-, triple-, and quadruple-crosses, but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it collapses upon itself within the first 30 minutes. mostly, after that point, i simply watched out of momentum, and a mild curiosity about how each scene would play out. there is a great cast here-- you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from much better movies. why are they all in this? i suspect it was 1) the work, and some money, even if modest. 2) perhaps the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around la--- you know, perhaps they participated to support him, as a fellow struggling movie guy on the third and fourth tiers of the hollywood scene. dunno... but the movie was half-baked--- not really "finished." i gave it a 3, although my affection for the actors involved was undiminished from my admiration of their previous work. let's hope everybody has moved on to more professional, more carefully done, and more thorough projects since.

i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible. i've been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing. this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground. i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant. if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try (le dernier combat). there have been very few movies that i couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them. absolute dribble!

while traveling by train, a woman (st√©phane excoffier) mistakenly gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. sooner she finds that a weird lonely pointsman (jim van der woude) that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track. the man lodges her in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them."de wisselwachter" is an overrated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere. i like movies off-hollywood, but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end. the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive. i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark; i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality. in the end, i was absolutely disappointed with this feature. my vote is three.title (brazil): "o homem da linha" ("the man of the line")

this movie was difficult for me to watch. stan looked very old and ill compared to what i remembered, and ollie was heavier than i ever recall in another film. most difficult though were gaps in the script/production where i found myself wondering, "how did they get from here to there???" it took nearly half the film before i could deal with the dubbing of non-american actors -- that was also a distraction.although i miss great actors such as laurel and hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era??? -- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes "bow out" in their prime.

i just watched atoll k-laurel and hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as utopia-on internet archive expecting to see some extra footage since the ia version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. turns out that it's basically the same version i previously watched on the bargain basement vhs tape from goodtimes home video that ran an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no product placement of the welch's grape juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space. while stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon, he still performs fine physical comedy with ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so. then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard-not to mention a charming female french singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on-takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of ollie saying for the last time to stan, "here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!" before stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out. in other words, if you're a die-hard laurel and hardy fan, this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for hal roach from the '20s up through 1940 when they completed their final roach film, saps at sea. come to think of it, even some of the l & h fox flicks (have yet to see the two they made for m-g-m) from the '40s are better than this one...update-8/29/09: just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the italian version on youtube. cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the captain. in another, that captain's wife pulls a gun on cherie. in one more, giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. stan is dubbed in high pitch here!

oh, why did it have to end like this? laurel and hardy's last film, from the crudely cranked-up cuckoo theme (with erroneous credit to hal roach) to the closing "nice mess"/"i couldn't help it" schtick, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. in between, their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting, asinine dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. people slate king of new york, but chaplin's final bow-out was nowhere near as undignified as this.what really hurts to someone who loves laurel and hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. the video cover i'm holding shows them at their prime, all boyish smiles and glowing skin, with a blurb on the back that reads "the photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film." necessarily? it doesn't even come close. the actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve, with ollie distressingly overweight. this is not humorously, or comically, fat, as he would normally appear, but ill looking and on the verge of obesity. he would be dead seven years after this film was made, after a series of strokes. stan, meanwhile, suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery, looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically. every time something bad happens to him, such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for his life. even ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed. he would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film, eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965. it's upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths. and it's distressing watching their deterioration, both in health, and in performance, on screen. when i, and, i'm sure, almost everyone else, likes to think of laurel and hardy, i think of way out west, busy bodies or our relations. seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog-end of their career is a blight on my happy memories of them.the warning signs are clear right from the opening credits, which list not only four writers, but also someone to come up with the concept, and a credit for "gags". so if monty collins was writing the "gags", then what were the other four writing? and in that case, why was monty collins paid a fee, given that there's no evidence of a single "gag" in the whole film? over 40% of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island, during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in. when i saw the bat scene i wanted to curl up and die, so great was its childish ineptitude. yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed, unable to speak english. not only does this make the film disjointed, but also it severely depletes stan and ollie's reactions to their co-stars. flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing, this totally belies the rumoured $2 million that was spent on it. frankly, it looks terrible, and while a dvd release might clean up the picture, the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their hal roach work.stan and ollie's "friends", giovani and antoine are charisma-free bores who stand out greatly against laurel and hardy's outdated repertoire. this is another major problem with the film, in that none of the supporting characters are funny, or keyed in to the boys' innocent mentality. the dubbed harshness shown to l & h ("you - the fat one") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than loveable sub-anarchists. there is evidence of some darker political satire - though duck soup this ain't - and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic. perhaps more relevant now than it ever was, a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the american constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003. sadly, however, beyond an amusing scene where stan is elected "the people", this doesn't really go anywhere. and this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges - or is a laurel and hardy movie where rape is directly implied and stan threatens a man with a bottle, only to accidentally glass someone in the face, your idea of a good time? after all the years of stan and ollie sharing a bed, we also get a definite reference, with stan accidentally kissing him - ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust. also worrying is the implication that stan and ollie's illegal immigrant friend, antoine, ends his life being eaten by a lion. mind you, i never thought i'd see a laurel and hardy movie where they were due to be hanged, either. the need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is, with the american release (the same version available on video) hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it.almost completely unwatchable, this horrifically made, relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of stan and ollie - avoid at all costs.

this 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel. we wanted to see another film, which supposedly was starting, but because a mix up, rent-a-cop, was shown in that time slot. never having seen it when it was commercially released, we took a chance at it. bad decision.one wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with "rent-a-cop", or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. it appears this movie misfired big time. this film doesn't add anything new to its genre. it's totally predictable, as once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end.burt reynolds plays a wooden church. this actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction given to him by jerry london, had the opposite effect. mr. reynolds has one expression throughout the movie. he just doesn't register any emotion at all.lisa minnelli, as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the chicago hotel, makes no sense at all. the romance between her della and church seems phony from the beginning. she and mr. reynolds play one dimensional characters.don't waste your time with this turkey.

i was sick one day and was skimming channels and i came upon this terribly rank movie. the plot and even the subplots (if you can find one) have been done to extinction. but, as bad as the story was, i reserve a special comment for liza minelli. her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters i have ever has the misfortune of seeing on film. her only two competitors in this category are john leguziamo in "the pest" and julia stiles in anything she's done (or half-done). maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe (groan!) that is the limit she has to her acting range. either way, they should have had a rewrite and killed her off in the first 30 seconds of the film (eg. like the girl that fell off the balcony in lethal weapon (i) (but at least she had nice breasts))most humbly submitted...douglas neidermeyer

a low-rent, cheaply made police thriller that's kept bearable by some fair humorous bits, the nice chemistry between the two leads and, especially, by james remar's satisfying turn as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and, naturally, indestructible) villain. obviously a low-quality picture, both visually and dramatically, with a rather resigned burt, but not unwatchable. (**)

live action version of dragonball via taiwan.evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls...er pearls which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish. lots of action and bad comedy ensue.what can i say that "the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends" doesn't? i don't know. this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be. come on this is one of the few martial arts films i've ever seen where you actually see the wires. its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what i've seen of the show that it makes me fearful for the big budget american version now filming.if you have some drunk friends and feel like picking on a movie see this film. if you're going to see it sober (like me) avoid it.

when you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before. keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent insane amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter. the crazy thing i noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (i wonder if the hong kong version was dubbed too?) i understand the cartoon had this, but it doesn't work for live-action. it just looks odd... as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors.the english version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. i would have preffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, i'll let it go. but there is something extremely odd about this movie. it's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about sex, rape, and stripping which isn't exactly for young western audiences. (in the orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). but parents be warned! there is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! who was this movie made for anyway?oh, and the special effects are laughable. you can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, i wasn't sure) that look unconvincing, even to a kid. the makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon, simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need. i didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as dragon ball z.i don't really recommed this movie to anyone. kids, adults, or dragon ball z fans. it's just a poor representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it. i won't even get into the camerawork... just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes... most of the shots are not framed correctly at all and the movie just seems made by amateurs. grainy film quality too.just all around horrible!!!!

just an hour ago i finished watching this my friend. as a fans of dragonball we think that this movie is so bad that is good. we will say one thing : without a sixpack beers there is now way you can survive through this movie. this movie should be watched with a many dragonball fans to laugh their ass off. the best character in the movie is the lord horn, his makeup, his laugh, and behaviour crates the unforgettable experience. what we liked in this movie, was the fact that the island of turtle man was the same as in cartoon version. we believe that the only character similar to the one in the cartoon is the turtle man. he is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot too.

mr. brento wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the dragonball z tv series. of course not.this is a hong kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the japanese original cartoon (which was also based on a comic book series). and i really don't know if it was produced under the license of the dragonball creators...however, the story of the monkey-boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over asia (in japan, the name of the boy in the tale is songoku; in china, it is sunwukong; in korea it is sonogong; etc) and the story in dragonball has much to do with that tale.by the way, as i said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the dragonball series (which was followed by dragonball z, although i think the us version had a different airing order). and all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without so much overacting and so much insistence on it!), but because of your comments i may suppose they were completely removed in the american dubbing.anyway, i agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is. but maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it...

not well done at all, the whole movie was just the grudge going around and killing random people out of nowhere. random people that have nothing to do with the story get killed, like the 3 school girls for example.the family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story either, i believe them to be a random family that never went in the house, and never had anything to do with the killings of the grudge.did not impress me at all, i was not scared, i didn't jump at any parts, and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of. makes the gridge 1 look like crap also, which was actually an alright movie.i believe that the grudge 2 is like a leading movie to the grudge 3, if they ever make one. they shouldn't have even called this the grudge 2, they should of called it the prologue to the grudge 2, and you will see if you watched it, because i am not going to spoil anything. not that it would have mattered anyway.1/10, not scary, bad story, and is just completely random.

spoilers ahead jeeeeeeeesussssssssss.... i have a saying: "insecticides kill insects and moronicides kill morons..." the "ghost" in this movie kills morons. several of the people who get killed in this movie are actually asking to get killed, by running into abandoned houses, going after ghosts, etc...on a strictly cinematic aspect, this movie sucks real bad. the three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly, we learn they are separated by at least a few days. it's a cheap shot...also, the "thrills" are so cheap, they are laughable. even "nightmare on elm street" didn't sink so low as to show someone being attacked by his own sweater... it's pathetic.save your money, stay home, and you won't have a grudge against the filmmakers..

my best guess is this piece of work will come out on dvd sometime before christmas.this movie was terrible. the time line jumps all over the place. this wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end. it was entirely predictable. bitch girls pick on outcast, outcast wants to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die a terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. outcast girl brought evil spirits with her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. creepy kid understands what's going on. oh, and the younger sister not being good enough for mommie, sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home. to be fair, there were some great moments here and there. first of all, sarah michelle geller's character dies in the first few minutes. definite plus. didn't see that one coming. i didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head, either. if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills, i would have loved it. the beginning showed so much promise. i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one. it made me jump, i didn't expect most of what happened, and though i questioned some of the movie, it was still a fun watch. i didn't watch any previews for this the sequel, because i wanted to be surprised. i was, but in the wrong direction.

all i can say about this movie, is it is absolutely boring. the intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film i have ever seen, i mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn't at all frightening which is what i assume the director was aiming for, but in fact it was "mildly" funny. the acting in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors, if your making a horror film, please hire some good actors, not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act.the death scenes in this movie were beyond boring... no gore, and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are just cheesy. i mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of tokyo, and not one person sees it happen, they just declare her as "missing", wow thats awesome!in conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure u bring some sleeping pills, because i guarantee you won't make it to the end.. me and my friend walked out cause we didn't even care what happened at the end.cheers

i loved the first grudge, i watched it in an empty theater,and in all honesty, i was freaked out. never before had i heard the unique audio of chilling sounds, it truly was gripping.the grudge 2 however, had a couple of good jumps, but the story line was real messy, and not entirely believable, and all over the place, with a couple of scenes, (like a female urinating herself out of fear, or another one of a young woman drinking a jug of milk then vomiting it all up again) which really made no sense, and did not help to enhance the creep factor of the film. during these scenes, and a couple of others, people in the sold out audience actually laughed out loud. that was a good indicator to show how this film lacked the thrills, chills, or creeps. the acting was decent, the emotions portrayed were believable, so hats off to the actors, but the cluttered storyline and its lack of direction was something i couldn't shake throughout the entire movie. i was annoyed more than anything, same old grudge gagging noises, a couple of quick unexpected scenes to make me jump, but overall, i was very disappointed.

to start off, i didn't bother seeing the grudge. the previews for that movie didn't make me jump, didn't scare me, and didn't entertain me. but when a group of friends asked me to go see the grudge 2, i accepted the invite, a little curious as to how this movie would be. i mainly went because of my friends. not even 5 minutes into this movie, i realized i threw away $7.50. the acting from the get-go is horrible. the schoolgirls in the beginning look as if they have never acted in their entire lives. then, the movie plot takes over. let me tell you, i could not stop laughing this entire movie. it is just so stupid. i'm pretty sure they tried to not make it scary. they don't make anything jump out or anything. it shows the kids, then shows them "attacking". it builds up to it, it's not an "all-of-a-sudden" thing. and even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the acting is still horrible. it leaves so much time in-between the dialog for someone to add in their own comments. this movie is honestly one of the funniest "horror" movies i have ever seen. poorly written, horrible acting, horrible script, horrible "unable to act" cast, and a horrible concept. the movie blacks out and changes situations more times than you can count. each part eventually plays out and then ties up at the end of the movie. i would never again pay to see this movie. i wouldn't even watch it on cable, for free. this movie is a joke. please do not waste your money on this movie!!

zombie planet seems like an example of good ideas and laudable ambition overstepping budget. i thought the explanation for the zombies was real original and gnarly, and loved the dog munching in the exposition scene. the rest of the gore was effective in a low budget kinda way, but too spaced apart throughout the movie. the problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. sure, they had a intriguing, if derivative plot line, and a similarly familiar but cool setting, but a low budget zombie film really needs to be goretastic to make an impression and there just weren't enough red moments in this for me. i think there was surplus of cheap looking and bloodless fight scenes as well especially given the generally minimal grue. plus, for a two hour movie, there's very little closure at the end, and though it kinda makes me want to track down zombie planet 2, i felt a tad cheated. so probably most worth looking for the two of them.

i live and work in lexington, kentucky, the town where zombie planet was filmed. i'd heard about the film forever ago, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. then, for several years, i heard absolutely nothing. imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store, just itching for a rental. so, being the cinephile that i am, i decided to give these local filmmakers a shot.bad idea.zombie planet is overlong, boring, poorly acted, miserably shot -- and that's just the good stuff. i tried my hardest to enjoy it, which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldn't get in the way of the horrible storyline. alas, nothing worked. zombie planet is so bad it's pathetic. and the very idea that they're planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms i'm sure they've heard. move on, you guys. please. in fact, refrain from film-making altogether. or attend a few classes on pacing, storytelling, and, well, basic direction.otherwise, for the love of god, hang it up.

just when you think that you've seen the worst the zombie sub-genre can offer, along comes another budding romero and his team of no-talent mates to prove you wrong.i've suffered the zombie bloodbath trilogy, endured death valley: the revenge of bloody bill, sat semi-comatose through the zombie diaries, and laughed hysterically during zombie '90: extreme pestilence, and genuinely thought that amateur movie-making could sink no lower. however, having just watched zombie planet, a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writer/director george bonilla, i think i have found the ultimate in awful zombie movies.in this dreadfully amateurish effort, which is part mad max and part dawn of the dead (but all bad), frank farhat stars as t. k. kane, a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby, armed only with knives, a machete, some concussion grenades, and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glare.after a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies, kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead, but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area (by searching for and handing over any valuables that they find).of course, kane isn't the type of man to take orders from a bunch of z-grade post-apocalyptic bully boys, and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson (mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner), only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombies.featuring awful acting from almost everyone involved, a dreadful script, laughable effects, and shoddy production values, there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch. to be fair, i quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates (we learn this when one character conveniently explains the back-story to kane, who strangely has no idea what has happened), but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production.i have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie, but when the results are this poor, that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. i would've kept this one under wraps if i had made it.

now, i'm a big fan of zombie movies. i admit zombie movies usually aren't all that good, but i like them anyways. despite the crappy acting and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all zombie movies, this one is by far the worst. see, there are a few ground rules with zombie-movies. 1. zombies are suicidal. tactics is seldom used, and never do they act like a boxer. they don't dodge a blow to the head, they take it with a ugly smile. they don't try and hit you in the face, they grab a hold of your arm and bite it! 2. zombies can't speak. only in evil dead. otherwise, they do not speak. 3. you don't fight zombies with melee-ranged weapons. you loose in a melee fight against zombies. firearms are used. in this movie however, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. very wrong.it had no redeeming qualities.if you wish to see a zombie movie, see one with an average score higher than 3 on imdb.com

once a month, i invite a few friends over for a "retarded movie night". we look forward to movies that are either so bad they're funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a lot of chests. last night, we were unfortunate enough to have zombie planet as one of our movies. the cinematography is on par with what we're used to, but the acting was a different story. the lead role is played by a johnny depp/rob zombie wanna-be who couldn't get a role in a high school play, let alone a low-budget horror film. our indecisive hero, who couldn't tell whether or not he wanted to be a bad-ass this scene or a whimpering coward was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that i have ever had to stop early during a retarded movie night. it had the possibility for greatness with a great twist on the standard zombie infection, but they took it an entirely different direction based on johnny zombie. i personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. however, it's unfortunate that i already invited a few over last night to suffer through 80% of this movie with me.

i work at the video store that rents this video in lexington and i must say...it should have never been made. i even know some of the people who worked on it who regret doing so. bad effects, horrid acting, bad script especially. i swear the dialog wouldn't have passed for the original psx resident evil; it's that bad. if you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this film to learn a thing or two. if not, don't waste your time. and even the director know it sucks because he keeps coming in to try to get us to upsale the movie. no sir. i've watched two-thirds of the horror section and this rates even lower than plan 9 from outer space. even ed eood would have said, "nope. that's too stupid even for me."

i saw this film in a cinema-club in germany in 1970. most of the attendees were from the local private school at which i was teaching. i had seen a few godard films previously while i lived in france, and, though they hadn't been my favorites, i could at least make sense of them. being able to speak french helped.the fairly innocuous beginning of "le week-end" soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, maybe too well photographed, that soon made no sense to me. for me, films, like books, must have some clear sort of meaning. this didn't for me. i suppose i'm not "into" artsy films. images still haunt me from the film. to this day i refuse to eat rabbit meat, well-loved by the french. those who've seen the film might realize why. yes, the theme of materialism came through, but the cannibalism, the car wrecks, and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me. i'm not sure if i walked out before the end, but i certainly felt like it. i promised myself that i'd never watch another godard film, and i haven't and never knowingly will.my rating: nothing. it was the most disgusting film i've ever seen. others may have been more inept, silly or stupid. i've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever.

if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. it is slow paced, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, do i need to go on? it's message is good, but i have seen them been handled better in several other films. the acting isn't even any good. this movie is just even more awkward, as it start off as being funny (not intensional though)because of it's surreal story, than at the end, just becomes uncomfortable to watch.i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, than see the female lead role eat her husband.honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10. and if your not happy with my preview,seriously i'm an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can, to avoid this film.

this is a polarising film. people either love it or despise it, it seems. me, i despise it. the film comes from the same context as lindsay anderson's oh lucky man, but while that is a masterpiece, this is just horrible.both films take kafka's unfinished novel - america, for their inspiration and general ideal. america is a surreal story of a youth's travels through the country. kafka uses the this character as a pure observer, one who does not change over the course of the journey (although the book is about 300 pages and still seems only a quarter finished, so we'll never know). allowing kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurd/surreal situations and surroundings. oh lucky man follows this same template to show britain through the eyes of malcolm mcdowell and weekend does the same for france.both films are also hugely brechtian, using various tricks and techniques to point up the fact that this is not real, this is confabulation etc. but the difference comes where oh lucky man uses the constructed film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system, weekend uses the constructed film to bludgeon us to death with ideological polemic. because godard goes further than anderson in his brechtian principles, we end up with two principle characters in which we have no investment, at all. we're forced to spend 90 minutes with them, yet we couldn't care less about them. deliberately so. but in doing this, godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message, which, in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and overbearing symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed to camera. combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes such as the really horrible pig slaying, far worse than any of the off camera violence of the car crashes.the end result is like listening to a student political apparatchik droning on and on and on about his views whilst repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you get the message. the problem with brecht is, if you alienate the audience too much, then you've alienated them from what you are trying to convey. which always seemed self evident to me.the parts that really stick in the craw for this movie though, is the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the threesome at the start and the off-screen comical rape in the middle, which, even if it could be viewed as allegorical, completely destroys the film's faith in itself and it's characters, what little of it existed in the first place. it's so french with a capital f, it hurts.watch oh lucky man instead. that is a work of genius. weekend is a work of pretension.two stars, and only for the traffic jam scene and the piano scene, which are just hints at genius, although they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfying as without them, this is a bad film by the worst most pretentious director in the world, with them, well it's obvious that this is a damn good technical director making the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. somehow that's far worse.

this was one of the worst films i have ever seen. i'm still trying to get over how bad it was. just because it has godard's name attached to it, doesn't make it great. beyond the fact it makes absolutely no sense, we see one insanely long shot of a traffic jam that is not stunning, unbelievable or anything of the sort. while this long shot of the traffic jam is going on you will be feeling probably more like making a pastrami sandwich than continuing watching it. pieces of a supposed story, silly, stupid characters. what message are we suppose to take from this? it offers nothing and serves no purpose. the arrogance of the director in showcasing these puny, dull chain-smoking french people and having them sit around and converse for hours on end and then getting it passed off as art is truly astounding.

having not read the original book or seen the earlier film, and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film, i came to this film with an open mind.it's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film, because the whole thing seems so confused. it seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film, but what that is remains completely obscure.the effects were fantastic and very well judged. the idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out. however, it was downhill from here.all of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start. there are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost. at one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon.when hartdegen arrives in 802,701 a.d., the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to find out, what it is remains annoyingly elusive. this is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. so many things happen that there should be an explanation for, but there is no discovery. i really, really wanted to know what the film was "getting at", what there was to uncover, but to no avail. having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point, it seems like there has been a very half-hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and "dumbed down" that the meaning and context is completely lost.just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction, and becomes a mindless action film without any real action. it is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. by now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. the film comes to an abrupt end as hartdegen decides to stay with the eloi.in summary, after a good start the film is very disappointing. too much time is spent on hartdegen's adventures before arriving with the eloi. however, the worst part of the film is what i think is the most important part: the setting up of the situation with the eloi. the whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the film. after this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. with so many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. however, the finale where hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all.ultimately, the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents. the meaning and context was lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. what was so frustrating about it all, though, was that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't by any means a bad film, it just so easily could have been so much better. the start was very promising, the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents, and hartdegen's experience with the eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked, and had there not been such a temptation to "dumb down" and simplify. i just wish i had a time machine so that i could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made.

do you know that they want to escavate the moon for real?and in geneve there is the debated project that could lead to make possible time machine?all i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future(at the time of the movie)scientifical projects but real. hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie. now about the movie itself, i saw the original movie too, and i also read the book. the book i didn't like though, but the movie yes.i totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing,unlike the 60's one.that was very good with force, this one was only a paralled future of what is good movie.

this movie is a disgrace. how can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half-assed love story. the entire beginning of the movie was not in the h.g. wells story and didn't need to be. also the eloi were done completely wrong. they did build houses or form any kind of real society. they didn't care about each other at all. that was an important part of the story. the way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions. they were barely even aware of the morlocks. i don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.

the time machine starts in new york during 1899 where professor alexander hartdegen (guy pearce) proposes to his beloved girlfriend emma (sienna guillory) who accepts, unfortunately just after they are attacked by a mugger & emma is shot dead & dies in alexander's arms. jump forward 'four years later' & alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed, only a different way this time. alexander realises whatever he does, however many times he goes back emma will always end up dead one way or another & he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth. however after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on earth, the human like eloi & the monstrous morlock's that eat the eloi. alexander decides to stick around & save the eloi.directed by simon wells who is actually the great grandson of author h.g. wells who wrote the original the time machine book on which the original the time machine (1960) film was based & it is in fact the 1960 film that producer john logan's script is based upon here rather than wells original literally source. while all three share the same basic story & ideas this remake adds the subplot about alexander's fianc√© emma being killed & that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever & he can. the script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure & drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much, sure there are a few pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes & the moment when alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save emma is actually quite intelligent & makes sense it never really captured my imagination & i was never really moved by it either. the time travel aspects of the time machine feel very similar to terminator 2: judgment day (1992) in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only the time machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as terminator 2: judgment day. the character's are alright although i thought guy pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine & there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented & made one & it works perfectly. i reckon the back to the future trilogy offer far more thrills, laughs, excitement & general entertainment value than the time machine ever does & while i will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace, tells a reasonable story & has it's moments i wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. there is also a cheeky little reference to the book & original film which are both name-checked here.the benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects & in particular cgi which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built, new ridges, canyons & mountains being formed & a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. the effects work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good. i saw the time machine on telly & the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left & right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on alexander's time machine dial so i actually didn't know what year he went to. apparently director gore verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as wells was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion' while the imdb says that the time machine itself was the biggest & most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which i find hard to believe & guy pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on.with a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period new york & good effects work although amazingly the time machine was nominated for an oscar for best make-up but lost out to frida (2002). the acting is mixed, jermey irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make-up job that has him looking like a reject from a lord of the rings film while singer samantha mumba makes her big screen debut here & is simply terrible although guy pearce is quite good & fairly likable.the time machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable & passes an hour and a half but not much else. watch back to the future (1985) again instead.

if you loved the early-60's version of "the time machine", don't waste your time; as with last year's "the planet of the apes", this has been "reimagined", and not for the better. and, just as with "planet...", its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden; guy pearce, a terrific actor of great range, is all wrong for this role, giving a one-note performance that elicits zero sympathy; he's so dour and serious, and lacking in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them. worse yet, whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of david spade and calista flockhart?? a handsome actor, here he is sickeningly gaunt, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. frankly, the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly. he shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's. sadly, even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a screenplay that is utterly inferior, scattered and at times incoherent - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film, for the single fact that there is nothing in the way of character development! in the original, you got to know the eloi, so therefore you felt for them, and felt their terror of the morelocks; here, as the movie stresses several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. unless you're a member of peta, scared sheep are hardly the stuff of entertainment! samantha mumba does as well as possible, in her movie debut, but, like everyone else in this mess, most especially jeremy irons (if he's the leader of the morelocks [who look like rejects from "the mummy returns"], why then does he look like edgar winter's long-lost brother?) is completely wasted. also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, which belie the $70m spent on the film; they are uniformly lackluster, obvious and unconvincing. and then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed, its art direction and sets are just "there" and its costumes are typical in design. there isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. most of all, it isn't even fun! (the filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous orlando jones as "comic relief" but, as usual, jones is irritating, and just how does his electrically-driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?)all in all, this is an empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused affair: didn't they already remake "planet of the apes"??? (at least that had the fortune of some strong performances!) *spoiler!* the final insult (beyond a head-shakingly terrible, not to mention convenient, ending)? not only do they barely feature the changing dress-store figures, they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome bore! (if "the sopranos" had a time machine, this is exactly what it would look like.) pathetic...

this movie sucked. from beginning to end it was predictable. there was absolutly no chemistry between pearce and the mumba chick. the plot went nowhere, floating off into oblivion. all of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity. and i wanted to strangle orlando jones, the guy just needs to go away.

i was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater, even though i payed 4 bucks for matin√©e (before 6pm) prices.the remake's story was ho-hum, the cgi morlocks were lame, the eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no i did not think the chick was hot at all), the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, overall just a sad, bad remake. i'll take rod taylor, weena, and the fat glowing eyed surfer morlocks over this junk any time. my estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth. when the 60s version came out (i first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. you don't have to have an over abundance of cgi in a movie for it to be better. too much of this looks fake. i can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.

after reading the novel which is about a one hour read, watching this film became a sad disappointing experience. just as he did in prince of egypt simon wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery out of its source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. now i'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense. there was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. there were no thrills and that silly bookend with addy's character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. i felt very violated when this movie was over and i still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever. i wondered how the studio and director could have ok'd such a lousy script but then my friend pitched the movie to me exactly as it was and i said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie.

it's a time machine all right. it runs in "real time" for 96 minutes but it felt like 96 years. the first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous. massive amounts of "dead" time throughout. what happened? when will something happen? who cares? apparently the film was made on a tight budget, i note for your edification the following: the morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes from lord of the rings part i, hey? the "scary dude" in charge of controlling the morlochs... the scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of gene simmons: (of the band kiss) old costumes??? little-known fact: freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails.save your money, save your time. pass on this one.

worst. movie. ever. i can't believe they had to hire jeremy irons to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). "hey, let's make lots of things explode and give mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken english. that'll make the morons watch." "but sir, that's not how the book went at all, i think we're mot being faithful to mr. wells' message." "f*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. also, let's add in orlando jones with some classic 'black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - guy pierce has to get some p*ssy at the end."

guy pearce looks like and acts like a calvin klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear levi's jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding buffalo because they realize that buffalo like levi's too. in every scene, guy pearce looks like he is saying, "look at me, i am so pretty!" as a hero, his character is a total wimp. in every scene that calls for courage, pearce gets the short end of the stick. spoilers: yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like spiderman). around the same time, the time machine seems to cause a nuclear explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. strangely, even though pearce and his gal-pal mumba are about a foot away from the last morlock that gets killed; seconds later pearce, mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. now that is fast running!!! jeremy irons as the king of the morlocks is great. he really makes the movie a lot better than it was. mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much acting in this movie. the scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. the original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. the period characters were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. the original version of this movie made the past seem like the real base of the characters. this new version lacks substance and feeling. the scenes in which pearce deals with the death of emma and then fails to save her from her fate are very good. the issue of the morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones. all through the underground, the morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. so how can all those skeletons be in the pit? it seems like there are some morlocks that bar-b-que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other morlocks only like filleted flesh?? and where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? as i was watching the dozens of morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. all these issues were never addressed. at the end of the movie, pearce is holding mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, mandingo. one other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop lion king music which is in the background. once pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the lion king music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that african moaning singer (is it peter gabriel or paul simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the lion king jungle music. i watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but i think that elton john should probably look into this matter. time machine was a mediocre movie with some good fx. see it once, then forget it.

h.g. wells is spinning. no doubt about it.really, this would have been a decent sci-fi/adventure movie, if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. what resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization.the novel is a great sci-fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they're very young) is that it's overflowing with social commentary. the eloi and morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of victorian england, and the overall message of the film is that everything decays and degenerates, a satiric jab at victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. there's no love story, no romance with a beautiful eloi woman....in the novel, the eloi are 3-foot-tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal. the time traveler does befriend an eloi woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet, and anyway she's killed before the novel ends.this movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to "why he wants to travel through time." the treacly romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomit.the journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster. ok, not bad, but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates, as in the book. more a reflection of the times, i guess, as the george pal version had a nuclear war take place.the general story? ugh. a total misrepresentation of the novel. the eloi are too competent and warlike. the morlocks are too intelligent. the ubermorlock is an embarrassment, and there's no setup. he just shows up in time to be killed. yawn.samantha mumba does ok. guy pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain. (reportedly he broke a rib while filming this.) he also looks unhealthy and overly thin, as if he had been ill for a long time before making this.a sad, sorry film version of one of the world's classics. h. g. wells deserves better....much better.

the 2002 version of "the time machine" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. what a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? are today's movie audiences too hip for the h.g. wells writing largely as is? the 1960 george pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking eloi, and morlocks that looked like smurfs on steroids.the 2002 version must have h.g wells turning in his grave:1. the idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi clich√©. this totally distracts from the love affair with mara (what happened to weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. this sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. if guy pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma ¬ñ not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future ¬ñ from a morlock no less, doh!! what's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?2. only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. the george pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.3. the director goes out of his way to make pearce's character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. in the 1960 version rod taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and charming.4. among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. for over 4 billion years the moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.5. destroying the time machine is stupid too. apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. blowing up the machine to kill morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' disappointingly, pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.6. having morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins h.g. wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. a true cinematic opportunity lost. also, wells depicted the eloi as frail and childlike. these guys in the movie looked like they could take on morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.7. the one smart morlock ¬ñ kind of a bleached-out star wars evil emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells pearce to take his machine and go home ?! boy, what a dramatic high point! in the book the morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.8. the goof ball hologram at the n.y. public library is too much. it makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. derailed evolution is serious stuff.its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the dvd when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.

pep squad is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting.first, let's tackle the characters. cherry (brooke balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen. however, it becomes completely unknown to the audience why cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. before the nominations are even read off, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. why does she care so much to be their prom queen? brooke balderson apparently presents an "acclaimed" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. maybe it's just me, but i think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for much. you're also not allowing the character to develop very well.beth's character, played by jennifer dreiling, is even worse. dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever. when being harassed by her principal, she knocks him down (after several seconds) with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing. her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal box.throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal, sitting tied up in their basement.meanwhile, cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates, and no one even notices or cares. (yeah, i get it, i get it, the whole town is worried about prom. very realistic. at least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too much.) for example, right after cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students, beth is found being interviewed by the local media. the reporter mentions "the shooter" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, "what do you think about guns in the hands of minors?" or something to that effect. where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? at the end of the movie, after cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, beth simply adds that "she understands (cherry's) need to be heard" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. no one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (maybe i'm a little left out of the scene, but last time i knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their "i'm so indie and mod" attitudes), beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. yes. very realistic.the only compliment i can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. the angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot.too bad the acting and script aren't.

weird.this is a tv movie,yet the rating on the box says it's rated r.there's nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an r rating.aside from that,though,the movie is very slow and pointless.i mean the idea was good,but nothing was done with the storyline.it just wasn't developed.it's mildly creepy,and the acting is actually quite good,better than the movie deserves.i don't see myself watching it again anytime soon,if ever.there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one.i haven't seen too many wes craven films,so i can't really compare it to any of his others.as for this movie itself though,i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed.for me,i can't give chiller a higher rating than 3/10

a few minutes in: "not credible. what idiot wrote this?" but, "what's going on...who's the bad guy...then there's that rebecca de mornay." time passes....the end."not credible. what idiot actually watched the whole *@#! thing!"

forgive me, but this work of director peter hall is horrendous. if you can't get to us with the plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. that surely reaches the audiences. this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. and, believe me, i saw it coming before she opened the package. how predictable can you get. take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way. i have never been a fan of de mornay and this performance tells me why. overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, i found her rather silly and definitely boring. i did like banderas, but felt bad that he had to play opposite de mornay. he has done much better in other films namely "philadelphia" where he had some honesty in his dialogue. in this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real. but the writers, green & rush, did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue. please, let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment. some of us aren't fooled by corny plots, bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue. seeing her get away with it, made me furious.

what a stinker!!! i swear this movie was written by a computer that took a whole pile of other movies and merged them all together into this platypus of film. ouch!

this derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way, mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out, and because the director, peter hall, manages to stage a pretty hot (and quite bold) sex scene. but the finale, though unexpected, is preposterous, and the whole plotting (complete with childhood traumas and multiple-personality disorders) reveals itself to be unbearably cliched, especially as far as motivation is concerned. (*1/2)

i thought sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" ending in movie history, but of course i was wrong. i had no disillusions that this movie was going to be good. unfortunately, it was worse than i expected. the worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens.

with so many good movies coming out in 1995 (particularly "mortal kombat" and "seven"), unfortunately, there had to be some bombs as well, and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring, predictable plot and a lousy ending. it seems that antonio banderas hasn't been able to find a decent script since "desperado," the only remarkable film he's done. anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who demornay's stalker was from the beginning. her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but muddle an already paper-thin story. pity that dennis miller was wasted in this film; this part resembles his eerily similar role in "the net." the convoluted ending had me shaking my head, as i pretty much did throughout the entire movie. plus, any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets the thumbs-down from me. to make a long story short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, then avoid this at all costs. never talk to strangers...especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10

almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines (very briefly) and getting naked (not very briefly) in front of a anonymous (and uncredited) panel - almost certainly including producer charles band. thrown in are random scenes of surrender cinema's many movies (primarily lesbian scenes). most of the women like "riding horses" (hmmm); there is a polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition; a 'secret; camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen...jacqueline lovell (too made up but still beautiful) introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a 'sexy' way to the camera (if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with lovell and vanesa taylor from femalian is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian 'couple' ever). weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women, a frankly dull and uninspiring experience.

this one is a real stinker.the story just isn't up to par with most other tz episodes. it's pretty boring, though seeing peter falk made up as a fidel castro lookalike is kind of amusing.whenever twilight zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown, i'd grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it wound up being this episode! strange thing? this often happened to my mom (another tz fan like me) as well. there were so many times that one of us would say to the other, "i was all set to watch _the twilight zone_ and guess which episode was on? the cuban dictator episode!" obviously some people like this episode, as it gets a 6.7 rating ... how that happened, i have no idea - but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot!

while the twilight zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven--with some great episodes, some lousy ones and many in between. don't believe the die-hard fans--there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them.in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro, a near lookalike (peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard) obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them. while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this), it's amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay!! think about it--serling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious, preachy and silly in the process.it's indeed bad--almost laughably bad when seen today.

patsy kensit and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of art-gallery related murders, but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous. the serial killer suddenly isn't important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife (who's basically just a co-worker of hers) is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect. "tunnel vision" is a really dull, implausible and tension-free aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sex-thrillers like "fatal attraction", "disclosure" and "basic instinct". the characters are extremely one-dimensional and pretty much every good-cop/bad-cop clich√© is extendedly described in the script. the struggling position of police women in a corps full of men, the shoot-first-ask-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc etc¬Ö even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag. yawn! kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable, but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine. the end-twist is more or less interesting (not at all original, mind you) but, by then, you stopped caring for the characters a long time already. the scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ludicrously fake and clive fleury's directing is completely uninspired. what a total waste of time¬Ö

i saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and because david zucker was the director. i saw his previous "naked gun" (both parts), airplane and top secret!, and i liked, at least i had a good time and laughed. i'm not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces, but were ok. i don't recall any other more stupid movie than this. it's incredible how hollywood industry is in total decadence. if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture, then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days. this is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people. i don't have any good to say about this film. if you are planning to rent it or buy it, please don't waste your money or your time, avoid it no matter what. even if you are fan of one of the actors, does not worth it. in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid. i won't see a zucker movie again. (he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie, imagine that!). pathetic. awful.

this film is about the worst i have seen in a very long time. terence stamp's talent is totally wasted and just about the only thing that i enjoyed was hearing a favorite song of mine, "if i had a million dollars" by bnl, in the opening credits.ashton kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy who gets roped into house sitting for his boss. misadventures ensue. blah blah blah. if you have time to kill and having nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. otherwise, watch something else.there are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it is nice to see molly shannon and jeffrey tambor on the screen. they are always pleasures to watch though this film managed to dampen even these bright spots.

yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood can't even do the basics when it comes to film-making that it used to do in its sleep for decades. if the writer/director had any brains they would have based the film around stamp's character of tyrant boss jack taylor. when he's in the film early on it's nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing. once he departs for the majority of the film and kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventures house-sitting with guest after boring guest dropping in, the film totally disintegrates.as a result, what should have been a passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker.

this film made me so angry because of its stupidity that i felt the need to create an account on imdb to share with you my opinion. i liked ashton kutcher in "a lot like love" and this is why i still wanted to see this film despite it's current 4.2 rating. it is highly over-rated. i trusted that an actor (any of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such low/now quality production. it is very disappointing. the theme of home-sitting was much better used in "deuce bigalow: male gigolo". things that did not make sense here: fist of all, the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who doesn't know anything about taking care of it. secondly, the rule is not to let anybody in the house, but the house-sitter fails to follow this simple rule. the door is not locked?! and so on..

dreamy young ashton kutcher (as tom stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde tara reid (as lisa taylor). ms. reid thinks mr. kutcher is gay. kutcher works for reid's father, an anal retentive terence stamp (as jack taylor). kutcher agrees to "housesit" for the boss, believing it will get him closer to reid. mr. stamp has a pet owl named "o.j.", who becomes a toilet cokehead. this is a film to get your restricted to "g-rated" pre-teens ready for raunchier "r-rated" fare. it will help if they haven't seen the plot before, and especially like moronic potty humor. remember, people get paid to act like this.** my boss's daughter (2003) david zucker ~ ashton kutcher, tara reid, terence stamp

i was intrigued by the nasty boss character as i am one myself, and the actual boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger ashton kushner, but this movie is so puerile i had to turn it off. it was a waste of time to watch it. when people started peeing all over the living room, it was too much to watch. painful, awful crap movie. if they had just toned it down a little. are there really people out there that find it funny and like it? i was relieved to know that imdb readers rated it so low. the career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor. i liked that part. also, the opening scene with the coworkers on the train was cool as i like his coworker's characters. if you can stomach non-sense movies or you are pretty young, then it might be one you can stomach.

it was dumb. sort of like an adam sandler movie. there were a few funny parts but not that funny.i liked some of the actors in it though. there were some sat. night live people in the movie. but i wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on. and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie.

to be fair, i couldn't bear to watch this movie all the way thru, so i have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film. but the first 30 minutes or so are amongst the worst i have seen in a while. children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written, acted, and directed slapstick humor, but adults in full control of all their faculties should steer clear of this stinker.

"there are some things you just don't do" so says the tag-line of this, a 2003 david zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled my boss's daughter, and it's the tag-line which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it. there are indeed some things you just don't do, with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within my boss's daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture. my boss's daugther is a sordid; creepy; grotesque experience, a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. to see it is to endure it, to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself ¬ñ if any of the cast; writers; extras; hell, even the guys that worked as runners on the set, aid in producing anything as earth-shatteringly poor as this again, then it'll be either because they've been sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of film or, it'll be because they've most probably garnered employment on behalf of the friedberg/seltzer mob.my boss's daugther, (which i'm pretty sure ought to be titled "my boss' daugther", grammatically speaking), revolves around its hapless male lead, named tom stansfield (kutcher), and a night in at his boss' house as he chases that seemingly elusive 'goal' that is his young, blonde daughter lisa taylor (reid) - someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of jack taylor (stamp). tom spies lisa early on, she's taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. after trying to talk to her, but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in tom's crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after-dark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her - and yes, she does still live with her father. think hitchcock's 1960 film psycho with the gender roles between norman bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughs.the distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. they are a ruthless and smarmy bunch, whom it's made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush, without ever returning them. one day it happens with tom there, and his wish is to return it, thus pounding into us that he's-not-like-other-guys(!) this, as he first sees lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position. this rather obvious and flat-footed attempt to try and get us to 'side' with tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co-workers in this company.it is, however, as close as my boss's daughter comes to any level of film-making. from a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from hell. tom's arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is charged with house sitting jack's pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house. it's been established terrance stamp's character means business in the strictest of manners, firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee. it's not that jack is a shrewed businessman, he's a cleanliness freak; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land. you can imagine, that when we're let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong, there's obviously going to be trouble.the film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. the first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top, you may smirk, but by the time half the house is wrecked and michael madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug, you've got your head in your hands. each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless, the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall. inbetween the gross-out wackiness, the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky, saccharine driven romance as lisa and tom bond whilst talking of in-workplace and out-of workplace persona's, and that maybe they have more in common than first thought. by the hour mark, the film's opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when there's an entire scene that exists purely to target paraplegics and a dumb subplot to do with a head-injury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded. throughout, stamp's character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them, to which the common-place reply ought to be whilst channeling jack taylor: was reading the screenplay first too complicated-a concept for you, stamp?

this movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen. the humor was crude, hardly funny and been heard a million times before. the start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on. i got about halfway through and couldn't stand to watch any more of it. luckily i was only watching it on tv so it didn't cost anything, but i seriously recommend you do not waste you time or your money.nothing in the movie was new. the characters were not at all developed. i actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events occurring ... thats like what happens in home alone or something. not to imply home alone was in any way as terrible as this.

this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched. i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10. my advice is don't watch it. this doesn't even classify as a movie.you'd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie. acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline. highly unlikely sequence of events which aren't even funny. they are actually very lame and stupid. very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie. might even upset their careers a little.when i walked into blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie , so i decided rent it. i sincerely regret it.once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen. i was hoping it would get better , but instead it got worse.i am not exaggerating this. the movie is terrible. don't watch it. hope this helps.

this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there is so much at the house that goes wrong that would not happen it isn't even funny. granted this is a movie meaning things that won't happen in normal life happen here, however this movie is more far fetched than theories that no child left behind is working. all of these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage. i could deal with an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour i just can't take it, i would rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. did i laugh during this movie? no. not even once? no. horrible, horrible, horrible. the fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with ashton kutcher bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse. but wait, the day is saved because the damn owl can fly. wow amazing! however, i do give this movie some cred, its not as bad as epic movie.....

this is the first time i'm entering a comment for a movie i haven't viewed till the credits. reason for this is simple...people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. i usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but i reckoned this to be watchable. a regrettable decision which was based on other ashton kutcher comedies that were (semi-) enjoyable such as a lot like love and guess who.where those two movies had their charms and laughs, this had none (and i mean none!!). the acting is horrible, especially the 'boss'. tara reid was no surprise, how dare she call herself an actress?! the premise is thin and the plot doesn't thicken at all. not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and/or sweet...but as you probably already guessed, this was not the cast at all! the script felt like it wasn't quite finished and i wouldn't even be baffled if the director did some rewrites while shooting. my dog could've written a more coherent script, seriously. and he's not exactly lassie either :-).stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goof-ball comedies at times (like i do). this low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many...i (almost) never give a one so therefore...a 2.

for years i hesitated watching this movie. now, i know why. it was even worse than i'd expected. ashton kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career, since 'dude, where's my car?' tara reid co-stars as the girl of ashton's dreams, who asks him to babysit her father (and his boss)'s pet owl for the weekend. the rules: 1. no shoes in the house. 2. no people in the house. 3. the boss' son stays out of the house. 4. don't touch the furniture.well, you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes, how the rest of the film is going to turn out.you know, there are films like, "meet the parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it's entertaining to watch, and it's delivered in a way, that you can't wait to see what happens next. this, is not one of those films. you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen, and they're mostly stupid things that would never actually happen. it's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off, because it was so bad. but, i paid the rental fee, and figured i had to watch it now.tara reid was good, and i would like to see her in more films. though, i'm not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her career.the end result is a happy ending...but of course with the kind of film it is, you would expect nothing short of that.don't watch it. you'll sincerely regret it!

ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? well, look no further! this movie has it all! racism jokes, handicapped jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating dirt jokes, old man young wife jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, crap jokes, falling flat on one's face over and over jokes, overuse of blood jokes, rape jokes, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, a bunch of people yacking their coffee back up jokes, nudity jokes, see who can say the most swear words in one scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people!the worst part is: none of it is funny! (not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with.) it seems that when it just can't get any worst, it pushes your expectations to an all new bottom, as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. there was one scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time. i don't think i need to point out which one, but then again, i'm sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling.there was one moment at the end of the movie that actually made sense and was slightly realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled on with the nastiest remains of a trash bag and thrown several feet on the ground only to have a bunch of beer bottles smashed into his head. all of this probably when he least deserved it. so all thought of a 1 more point redemption was quickly regarded. this is indeed a terrible movie. this is one that needs to be studied and bisected into small parts at a film school to teach students what not to do.

for years i hesitated watching this movie. now, i know why. not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny, but there's also just nothing to laugh *at* about the movie. it was even worse than i'd expected. i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money. i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much. it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. i have used imdb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or, worse, buying this stinker!! really a waste of time and money. i must say that the plot line is awful.

this movie is perfect for any aspiring screen writer, actor or director. by watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today. there are so many clich√©s that it pained me to sit through this movie. nothing about it is original and every single line spoken has been ripped off from those clich√©d movies that we all saw in the 90's. although it does have a few cheap laughs, overall it is wrong wrong wrong. i was so immensely bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic i actually noticed how much make-up was caked onto tara reid's face to hide those massive bags and wrinkles from her endless partying. seriously, she was wearing so much foundation you could literally scrape it off and refill an entire bottle of it.what shocked me though was that so many of the talented and popular cast would sign on for this piece of junk. and i do not know how i sat through that horrible screaming that ashton kutcher does, you know when he's like angry or something and he shouts his words in this annoying manner? ashton's horrifying "talking", tara's face being ten shades darker than her neck, a drugged up owl, a script that seemed like the work of a three-year-old...seriously, in my whole life there has been no movie that i have watched that i did not in someway enjoy no matter how bad it was. this deserves an award for being the first. bad bad bad... i don't think there is a single word in the english dictionary that can possibly describe this trashy movie. today i was trying to re-watch it but i had to turn it off like ten minutes in because i was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clich√©s.don't even bother to rent this at your blockbuster, it's not worth a cent, as a matter of fact i am willing to pay anyone out there considering to watch this movie so they can go do something decent with their lives.

i have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much. it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. this is not a funny movie. i must say that the plot line is awful. i did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. the characters are not very inspired. just terribly annoying. this movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with his tyrannous boss's daughter. when he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's owl, and he thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at 6 pm. he gets to be very disappointed finding out that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend. after her father leaves home leaving precise orders, about taking care of the house and his beloved bird, appears a secretary, a renegaded son and all sort of not funny stuff happens in the house. but he finally hooks up with his boss's daughter. trust me this movie is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!

not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies. i'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that actually are boring and not to talk about ridiculous. with the millions they used to make a movie like this, because i don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum. with that money imagine how many good independent movies you could make, or maybe one good hollywood movie. its just to rip you off, but not anyone, just the majority of teens that are willing to go and see an ashton kutcher movie, just because they are fans of him. i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. if you actually look at it in prospective the actors are the same quality of this movie. so i guess i shouldn't be surprise, i actually couldn't have expected more.

this film was terrible. i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse. from the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable rom-com, but the moment he arrives at the house it just disintegrates. none of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was tom, although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while. the dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non-existent. in an insulting attempt at comedy the writer/director introduces a new character or event in practically every scene, none of which are realistic, making it very confusing to keep track of what is going on. the plot is barely an excuse for a movie : guy likes girl, house sits fathers home to get to know girl, destroys house, gets girl. a complete waste of time.

the trailer is so deceiving... i thought this will be a good film... what was the point in bringing the women in hong kong for being killed? they could have done it in paris. and the fist half hour:-you love me!-no i don't! -you love me!-no i don't! -you love me!-no i don't!repeat for 100 times... then... well i don't love you... so i shoot you! :d so here is the reason why movie piracy is a good thing! imagine if i would have even give money for this torture! i'm sorry for the time i lost watching it... the film makers should pay me for the inconvenience... worst film ever seen...

the story is disjointed and poorly written. we are given threads and a possible hook in act one, only to see it vanish. had the writer bothered reading his work carefully, it wold have been apparent that madsden's character's initial problem and meeting with the 'bad' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem.the problem goes nowhere. the relationship goes nowhere. and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. no-one digs anyone and no-one is appealing. the writing and directing is laughable. you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement. there is none. the writer/director is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie. from simple errors such as '...they took polaroids...' - in japan in 2007 ? to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism, this movie is an insult. you cannot make them much worse.and by plastering 'madsden' on the talent list, the producers thought they'd have some success. he is hardly acting. asia certainly is... and the result is some heroin-chic panto.give it a big miss.

asia argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn't a bad thing in it's self, but, when her character talks about all the guys she serviced, and to see her with michael madsen and an asian guy in the present tense of the movie, it made me feel like i needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, like a disease was going to rub off on me or something.the movie felt like it was going for a love triangle/drama/action/??? plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. the acting was great, the plot, not so great. the director needs to at least pick a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this again, because they are not very good at it obviously.

tired, garbled dreck. the chemistry between argento and madsen was as exciting as a wet doughnut. their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. the storyline was a mess. the acting forced. the cinematography lingered on the uninspired. lazy and pointless. kim gordon and her character had no reason to be there. nor did anyone else for that matter. i couldn't have given two farts for any of the 'characters'. their emotions skipped and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroin. empty and dull. why do i have to write ten lines of text on here to make my point? i think i summed it up in the first three words. but, obviously it's not enough. i think this is the last time i'll bother to waste my time critiquing a film. anyway, i saw 'clean' and thought that was quite ineffectual as well. again, i cared not for the characters, whether they lived or died.

low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story. this movie is also known as lady frankenstein. the alluring tania frankenstein(sara bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. baron frankenstein(joseph cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. supporting cast features mickey hargitay, paul whiteman, paul muller and herbert fux. a rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. still a fun watch.

mel welles, you might remember him as mr. mushnick in roger corman's little shop of horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr. frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. you see, tania frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. the story is tissue-thin here, and one gets what one might expect: lots of leering and suggestive comments(surprisingly most from the female lead), special effects that are not so special, acting that lacks depth of characterization, and not really much action or suspense. and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling, lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable - not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless. italian actress rosalba neri aka sara bay/bey plays the baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal. she oozes desire and seduction quite well. her performance is pretty one-dimensional, but she is quite lovely and plays over-the-top a little too well. she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. poor joseph cotten, now regulated to european horror films for money, plays the father in a brief yet competent performance. he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear. as for the rest of the cast, paul muller is somewhat effective as dr. charles marshall, the baron's assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, policeman(i wasn't buying this)mickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers - despite what you might think not to her satisfaction. where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script, weak performances, and lackluster direction all head further south. the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s. while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think, lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones.

what a terrible movie! the acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play, or a story driven pornography film. this is not pornography in this film, but there sure is a lot of gratuitous nudity! this is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film, one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star. also there are a million cops that die in this film. hardly offensive though since the violence is so unrealistic we can only laugh. but breasts pop out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times, if you enjoy really really bad movies check this one out. this is a bonnie and clyde type story, where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge. this film also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people i have ever seen rolling around naked!

i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse' drive-in cult classics (featuring crown international pictures releases) on dvd. as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets, i am growing to love many of crown international's movies -- especially, the creepy, erotic, psychological thrillers! death machines is not one of them.after seeing movies like malibu beach, the creeping terror and the pink angels, it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made; but, it doesn't have much going for it.no plot; really no story to speak of.the acting isn't evident ¬ñ only the actor responsible for the terribly-played tony (with the thick, fake italian accent) made any attempt to "get into character." the score is annoying and pedantic.the only thing about this movie is why... what compelled the film-makers to make this film? did they think the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing crime bosses, 3) an ancillary bartender / karate school student character; and 4) his pitiful love-interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made? this is a complete waste of time and money, for you, me, the producers, writers, actors, and the director.

i'm from texas so i thought i knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. whenever she was on the screen i couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. take about stage presence! there seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. there was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away. all the hit men in this movie seemed a bit deaf, no one had to sneak up on them. the one handed 'hero' of this movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny. the bar-fight was pretty funny. there is a priceless scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judging from their expressions, it wasn't good for either one of them. it made me laugh out loud. this movie is on the 50 movie pack martial arts set if you want to see a lot of bad movies (with a few decent ones).

bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. i mention him only because there is an actor in death machines who looks just like him playing the owner of an italian restaurant. he appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a dragon lady (mari honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate. our hero (let's call him not paul from the diamond center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of the simpsons' luigi ("you lika da spaghetti?") and seems unimpressed when one of his patrons complains about the food. no, there's no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there's a red buddha in the pasta, the calling card of the murderous crime boss, who sends a statuette to each of her prospective victims. death machines is bad by any measure, and pretty boring, which is an even worse crime.

as bad as this movie is, i really like it. the poor acting, dialogue and action made it so funny. i loved john travis from omega cop and stayed up all night working out how the death machines checked in at the airport if they can't speak, probably had to shake/nod at the security questions. actually why can't they speak!? it fails to adhere to any sort of movie making convention which makes it strangely interesting to watch- just lots of people getting killed around a very loose plot surrounding hired killers - no "machines" as such and those weird face/mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear! i love the fact that there is no good guy in this film until about half way through and i love the numerous pointless scenes of that aeroplane landing - lots of people get killed who have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given about anything - do not expect to understand this film. instead admire how the main good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar - who is presented as the bad guy yet speaks out against the barman's decision to hire a scantily clad woman to dance badly in the corner for "entertainment" - all the good guys seem to enjoy this! why did old guy get to beat up our hero - and why did the random bloke decide to help old guy in the fight?! why did the hero collapse under one punch from old guy onto the bar where a stream of water jets out in the background so it looks like it's coming from his mouth? definite top 20 b-movie, must check for a part 2.

there is a point in the film where the female boss of the "death machines" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive i think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. except such is her delivery that it sounds like "leatherage." at which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. but it didn't. the boss lady had to do the talking as the "death machines" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does. interminably. there is action in the film but it is not that exciting and the plot staggers from one clich√© to another. the three mute "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the film. hopefully there wasn't a sequel.

as an avid fan of christian film, and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for improvements in the realm of christian film-making, i was excited to get a chance to see this film. i was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. i was left disappointed.the beginning scene is excellent, though a slight rip-off of leon - the professional on the angle, it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings... everything after that was pretty much downhill.i was barely able to sit through this one, i was tempted multiple times just to shut it off.the acting, while quite possibly sincere, was incredibly awful. but then again, the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself. the dialog was worse than anything i have ever seen, and even my amateurish screenplay "the awakening" (soon to be an independent film) looked like a hitchcock-thriller next to this. (which isn't saying much.) the bright side of this film is that it was filmed on sony's brand new high-definition 900 cameras shooting in 24p. this film and star wars: attack of the clones were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year. unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting, poor angles, and awkward handling.the only good feeling i got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it. ; ) 4/10

...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. i've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that i have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with "gone" isn't happy with what i had to say. so, i've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: ""gone" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words. horrible, stilted dialogue, a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water, acting that would embarrass the most self-centered of community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the "survivor" school of swooping crane shots followed by static, nostril-exploring close-ups, terrible adr work, special visual effects that aren't, pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion, terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades, no art direction to speak of---the litany of badness just goes on and on...i felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it...time that could have been better spent staring at a wall...under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this "movie," because long before it's over, they will be wishing they had been "raptured" before they made that mistake." case closed. amen.

i'm a christian, and i have watched pretty of christian movies, but this one is too bad. they try to make this good, but it's too hard for them i think.- you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - you can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. i think there will be a lot more of them.- the quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. the story is not so very bad, but could've been better. the only plus i give, is to the story in this film, but totally i can't rate it more than 3/10. watch "left behind" instead!

one of the reviewers here wrote: "good acting, good special effects, greatlocation. even better ending. " all i can say is, "ugh." this movie was painful to watch. let me start by saying this: i am a christian- considered extremely conservative by many people i know. so, what i am about to say is not biased by the"christian content" of the film. i'm not gonna bash it because it's christian. i am gonna give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. the writing is bad- over the top, way too preachy, and much of the "preachy" stuff is just plain irrelevant to the story. it just makes for bad scriptwriting. whether i agree with thescreenwriter's beliefs is irrelevant- make a good script that flows well, stays on track, and is believable. the acting was amateurish at best. but hey, when you cast amateurs, you getamateur performances. dirk been may have been on "survivor," but that showrequires zero acting ability. playing on his name and reputation to sell units is in bad taste. cast unknowns who can act and you'll have a much better film. the effects were horrible. the scene with the hail and the subsequent falling of the stars was embarrassing to watch. and what was so great about the ending? it made no sense.yeah, i know whattim chey was going for, but it missed the mark, big-time. i bought this film and expected so much more based on reviews and themisinformation on their website. and, although i was hoping for more, i got what i always get when i watch "christian" films- an under budget, poorly written, pathetically acted, badly produced piece of ka-ka. maybe someday, someone will finally step up to the plate with an end-times film as well-written and as well-made as gibson's "passion..." was. 2/10 stars.

the relationship between the lone ranger and tonto was always good for a snicker, but to take the joke out of the joke by building a movie around the gay appeal of the legend... oh the horror, the horror...

i waited quite awhile till i was able to watch this lone ranger movie. i finally got to see it on the lone star channel today and was very disappointed in the whole movie. clayton moore and john hart acted better lone rangers and jay silverheels as tonto, than the two stars in this movie. very poor acting was done by everyone in this movie. even the plot was bad and far fetching. i believe the horse, portraying silver was the best actor throughout this movie.i am glad i didn't go out and buy a copy of this movie when it first came out, as i feel it's a waste of good money. i am truly sorry the characters that clayton moore, john hart and jay silverheels played, and brought to life on the silver screen, have been tarnished so badly. unless in the future, they find actors worthy of portraying the characters in the same manner which clayton, john and jay did so well in the past, i'll not spend the money to buy the movie. i'll not watch this movie again.wayne davies

whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. the lone ranger is not camp, but "the" icon for good-doers all over the world. and it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real lone ranger, mr. clayton moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, i had the honor of meeting mr. clayton moore in columbus ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over mr. moore's treatment. needless to say, mr. moore's character, integrity and presence far outshined the movie.some things cannot be done better. there is only one lone ranger.

i loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station. i bought it and i couldn't wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid, and then as i saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... why in the world did i like this film as a kid, watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible. the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it!!! the costumes are perfect,good actors, there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful, and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive, the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like merle haggerd, and the statler brothers and those songs like "the man in the mask" are so bad that they are funny. this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline, and one of the best western plots ever, and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to health,after he and his fellow rangers are ambushed.its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger,as he concels his identity, and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with. but unfortunatly,as good as the storyline is, its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happen(for the love of god why did they do that?) between merle haggard's narration and the statler brothers singing corny(stupid) songs like "ride little cowboy" being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious. i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re-do this film right,because at the heart of this silly film is a great western.---i would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing. i give it 4 stars out of 10 --if your 12 years old, and dont know better, then you might love it.

i guess it wasn't entirely the filmmaker's fault though. the film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision to tell clayton moore (who had done the role in the 1950's and was the lone ranger us old folks grew up with) he couldn't wear the mask in public. now mind you, the poor guy wasn't making all that much money doing so, and it wasn't like he was going to take anything away from this film, but the whole thing seemed... gratuitous.the other thing the film suffered from (besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to overdub it) was that fact that westerns weren't so hip in 1981. john wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decade-long major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on genocide of the native americans. (that and blazing saddles sent up the whole genre! the campfire scene. enough said!) hollywood shied away from westerns, because science fiction was cool then.the one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken president grant (and seriously, i'd have let grant stay with the bad guys. the country would have been better off!) grant asks tonto what his reward should be "honor your treaties with my people". yeah, right, like that was going to happen!

there are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. let's start with the silly and annoying songs. like "ride little cowboy" which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of klinton spilsbury. the silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.i had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and i saw klinton spilsbury interviewed on various tv shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice. his body language was not exactly what people remembered who were fans of clayton moore and the lone ranger tv series. spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking trash about clayton moore after the producers got an injunction prohibiting moore from appearing at conventions and other events as the original lone ranger. clayton moore was not even allowed to sign as "clayton moore, the lone ranger." he could only sign as "the masked man." the incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was only added to by the petulant attitude of spilsbury who was very quick to tell reporters that clayton moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out! sadly, even after the movie was a total flop, the company that owned the lone ranger refused to lift their injunction against clayton moore, and he was never again permitted to sign anything except as "the masked man" and he could not don his black mask at any public appearances. between spilsbury's diva personality and the negative publicity the movie got, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. worse yet, a few weeks before the movie was finally released, the news was leaked that spilsbury's voice in the movie had been over-dubbed by james keech because the producers thought that spilsbury did not sound very convincing as a cowboy. the ridicule and derision that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail into the coffin.but then there was merle haggard narrating his way through the movie. apparently, the producers were hoping that the macho image of haggard (one of the outlaws of country music) would add credibility to spilsbury as the lone ranger. the narration by merle haggard was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with. at times haggard rhymes his narration, and it sounds like some weird kiddie movie. combine the rhyming narration with the "ride little cowboy" songs and any credibility that spilsbury could have mustered was destroyed by haggard and the soundtrack.tonto was played by michael horse, and as others have pointed out, horse had a lot more personality than spilsbury. in fact, perhaps because of spilsbury's allegedly combative attitude during filming, it seems like horse was given a lot more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected of tonto. tonto takes charge and often is the leader instead of the lone ranger. i was expecting (or hoping) that billy jack would make a cameo as tonto's brother (it would have made the movie a lot better). horse is not only more interesting than spilsbury, but he says more and has better scenes. perhaps it was a case of horse stealing the show from spilsbury. however, since the movie was so wretched, horse did not get much recognition. unlike spilsbury, horse has had a very productive career in the film industry.perhaps the last negative about this movie is the powder blue outfit of the lone ranger. the material that was chosen for spilsbury was more powdery blue than what clayton moore normally wore at appearances. that choice of color for the outfit just made spilsbury look more effeminate in his role. the comic book version had shown the lone ranger also wearing a red shirt and black pants, and that alternative outfit would have helped spilsbury look more convincing as the lone ranger.the supporting cast mostly mailed in their performances. they all look as if they were working on a tv episode and nobody seemed very convincing. even the villain, cavendish lost his edge due to the people around him. overall, i feel sorry for spilsbury. not only did he do a terrible acting job, but it is obvious that the production and publicity were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had. even if he had been an excellent replacement for clayton moore, i doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors. as it stands, this film is funny in a sad way.

i remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. at first it sounded like a great idea. a retelling of an american classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. there was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original "lone ranger", clayton moore. the movie studio had threatened legal action if moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (moore was performing at children's hospitals as the lone ranger for sick kids.) to many americans clayton moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger. i had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and legacy of the lone ranger if moore had been treated better. maybe even a cameo in the new movie. how ever this was not the case, and many of the viewing public stayed away in droves. also the story and acting were weak. all this added up to a big box office bomb, and rightly so. i personally i'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real lone ranger was treated. you don't treat an american icon that way.

i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the producers' court order against clayton moore using the name "lone ranger" or donning his black mask at personal appearances. quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality, this was the absolute height of nearsighted arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their attorneys. and i suspect that the lesson was well-learned after this film tanked, which was widely perceived as some sort of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against moore.in more recent times it has become the custom, when reviving a legendary film or tv project, to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances, and rightly so. show some respect, you idiots! and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect, which has happened, at least the offer was made. this is proof positive that film producers, studio executives, and entertainment attorneys are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.

this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades. i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything. revenge, love, justice? not in this guy's portrayal.there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr. if the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality. ewww.the dialogue is predictable and boring.the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like. i cannot believe the director would agree to this. it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed.hey, at least the horses and locations looked good, maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director.rating-2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is.

the untold origin of the lone ranger. it shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger.legendary bomb. the idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the lone ranger for 1980s audiences. right off the bat though there were problems. the studio ordered clayton moore (the original ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the lone ranger. it led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. i know of people who refused to see the film because of how moore was treated. also they hired the awesomely untalented klinton spilsbury to play the ranger. spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act. in fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor! also his off screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people up) didn't help matters. acting aside, the script is dull and slow. also the ranger himself doesn't show up until an hour in! there were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a pg. however i don't think it was that bad.there are a few (very few) things done right here--the photography was truly beautiful; michael horse was excellent as tonto; christopher lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the lone ranger finally shows up (with the william tell overture booming from the soundtrack) it's really rousing. but, all in all, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the lone ranger. it's easy to see why this bombed. a 4--mostly for the photography.

this movie totally sucked!!! don't even rent it! you'll hate it! the plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? if that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! i very much disliked this movie(hate is such a strong word!). and penguins cant fly! even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. i am not who you think i am!

would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? my eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. my ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. it's formulaic every step of the way. talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the "dreams can come true" schtick? show some more faith in the children's intelligence please. next to rock-a-doodle, this is one of bluth's worst.

whoa. i mean, whoa. i mean, whoa whoa.i saw this movie, waaay back when i was eight, in 1996. back then, cgi films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. also, back then we listened to things called cd players. but i digress. i used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, i've held reaally fond memories of it. hey, it's don bluth! anyone who hates "all dogs go to heaven" is clearly a robot. but, again, i digress.then, i saw it again. this really isn't one of his best, i can say now, eleven years later. i've seen a lot more films, and i've garnered a little bit more knowledge. now, sure, the voice acting is good, i'll give 'em that. story's...okay. i mean, we see it all the time. a lot. but, it works. the musical numbers are what irk me. this would've been more at home in the eighties, with these kind of musical numbers. in '96, most kids movies had epic numbers, like the lion king (which came out a year or so previous, but whatever)or stuff like that. you get showtunes here, vaudeville style.the animation kind of hurts, too. at times choppy, and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot, it's really hard not to notice.i still like "all dogs go to heaven, but this could've been waaay better.4/10

i rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995. after rewatching it again,my idea about it hasn't changed much.i was an adult then and i'm still an adult now!lolthe illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me. this isn't a documentary,it's a fantasy story where animals can talk!while i didn't care for much of the songs,i liked the one at the end of the picture where it's sang by barry manilow and another person.some people seem to make an excuse for it's primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn't used often in animated features but let's not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it!!but i think it's pretty fair to say that the pebble and the pingoin was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn't....the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous(mostly) underwater chase scenes.i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story. but most of the time,the story dragged on and was boring.worth a look if you like animation but if you're an adult and not a risk taker,go get another walt disney production instead of this!

i'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when i saw this movie in a $5 bin i figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. while i never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.the premise has enough potential. a penguin named hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea. he then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home. that set up isn't great but it's enough to set up what could be a fun adventure. unfortunately the duo's exploits never really amount to much and it all gets pretty repetitive. most of the situations they find themselves in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity...and the bonding the two of them under go is cheesy and forced.animation is good but not up to don bluth's usual standards. this is the guy that gave us the secret of nimh, land before time and an american tale, all of which had an attention to detail that often surpassed disney, the granddaddy of feature animation. this one doesn't amount to much beyond high end tv fair.the music is alright but pretty forgettable and the voice actors are all wasted talent...martin short is particularly wasted here as the lead character who in spite of being spoken of as a bumbler is practically a straight man through the whole film.in short the movie will probably appeal to very small kids but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it doesn't got what it takes.

hubie -- like stanely the troll from bluth's a troll in central park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. we're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.his character design is unappealing. the top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.and penguins should not have teeth. i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, gilbert gottfried. hubie, with his weenie little voice (provided by martin short), looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak.tim curry, who is usually delightful at being evil, does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain (might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice, not the supposedly menacing main villain).the entire plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for female penguin marina, who is just as dull as both of her suitors.worst of all is the pacing. we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more - this time in dialogue, this time in song...barry manilow may be a great songwriter, but in animated films like this and thumbelina, his songs feel limp and listless - especially the ballads. the only song i liked was the 1930's-ish "good ship misery" song.i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes, and that could have caused some of the problems - though i suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it ;).

even die hard john wayne fans will have to concede that this film is a mess. wayne's character, john tobin is after the gang that killed his parents, led by half apache, half white renegade pandro zanti (earl dwire), posing as a mexican. there are almost too many silly plot points to count, but those that stand out include sheriff williams (jack rockwell) cuffing a captured zanti around his boot, so all zanti has to do to get free is remove his boot! tobin's friend dusty (george pre-gabby hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back, and comes back good as new for the rest of the story. in a chase scene, tobin rides a makeshift log flume through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and missing his mark, chases (actually walks after) zanti on foot through the desert. zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but oops!, he didn't see the sign above the waterhole that states "don't drink poison". as zanti collapses dead, tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang, and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into dusty's cabin - how convenient.in the closing scene, the new sheriff tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new mrs. tobin (sheila terry), dusty's daughter ruby, who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of zanti's gang. apparently, the studio was intent on wayne's getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him, as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of lone star's films.

what a silly movie. while it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. on the one hand, the film suggests that juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. on the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like miss havesham in a castle. this movie is what elizabeth would have been if elizabeth had not been able to get past essex's sexual attraction.

vicente aranda has made a terrible historical movie. it shows the poor resources of the spanish cinema. in the movie, an irreal script shows juana just as a ninphomaniac, faced to felipe, worried only for sex...but sex with others not with her. the technical mistakes begin with the wedding ring that shows isabel of castilla -nobody noticed that?-. then, the voice in off seems as a documentary, actors and actress in the movie sometimes laughs -take a look to the sequence when juana arrives to the council which want to keep her isolated-; the castles are almost broken when in the age of the movie they have been recently built, crowds are just "four" people, lights are bad placed...compared with amelie poulain, the french movie for the oscars...it has no sense to speak about a bad movie like juana la loca.

this film is a great disappointment. director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril. in juana la loca, he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer pilar lopez de ayala, but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie. while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband, it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; juana was an important figure in spanish history, and politics of that time were essential in her storyline... but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera; this is a real pity, and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa. worst of all, italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances, which, in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso, a pivotal role in this story. it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences, as both of them look like top-models of this era. on the other hand, talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped. even if this was a big-budgeted film, little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating "period pieces" on the screen. costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material,without regarding of a real coherence. all in all, the main problem with juana la loca (and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth) is the lack of a director's point of view. this a strange turn in aranda's career, as he was able to develop it in other works (libertarias and amantes come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting movies, while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece... and a not very good one at that!

allegedly the "true story" of juana de castilla, the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella (yes, the same who funded columbus's expedition), the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the archduke philip of austria, known as "the handsome" (and played in a rather unispired manner by italian hunk daniele liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). this is a groan-inducingly familiar story of late 15th c., early 16th c. intrigue, betrayal and bodice-ripping. it drips destructive lust from start to finish. but while la reine margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and ruthless, cut-throat intrigue entertaining to watch, juana la loca just doesn't pull off. it just ends up feeling like a big-budgeted soap opera, with below-average, lazy or over-keen acting. liotti looks positively bored and pilar l√≥pez de ayala in the title role ¬ñ though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent ¬ñ just seems to be trying too hard, switching back and fourth from two-dimensional horny-looking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way through. some of the supporting cast are ok, with the exception of manuela arcuri, another italian pin-up, voluptuous and beautiful but really no "actress" to speak of. i couldn't in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character, nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains. what a waste of a substantial film budget! this one, sadly, is just so rhetorical and deja-vu, nodding to other films in the genre rather than to its source material - history - for inspiration. it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior film-maker to evoke it.

ok,i've seen over 100 troma films, and some of them are pretty bad. "sizzle beach u.s.a." was horrible, and "i was a teenage tv terrorist" was unwatchable, but this is the worst film in the troma library!a bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.this is really terrible. even as exploitation films go. doris wishman and hershall gordon lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film. avoid this movie at all costs.

"escape from hell" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. the direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between cintia lodetti and ajita wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the "fake plague" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it. i would have given this film a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and christina lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points. of course some sickos will take that as a recommendation. after all, one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave it positive reviews!

have you ever wondered why these guys -- seagal, stallone, willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? i think i've got it figured out. the enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.here, seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. one of the heavies has a shotgun. or maybe two of them have. it doesn't really matter. there could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.and when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it. the evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is, brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows. not only is he a master of these outr√© skills but his physical strength is herculean. more than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick. one he breaks a guy's spine over his knee.i'll tell you something. (i'm getting into the spirit of the film here because seagal uses that line, "i'll tell you something," several times, along with, "what's that supposed to mean?") these guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good xenophobe's handbook. they are all black, speak with unintelligible jah-may-can accents, wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo, they torture and murder with aplomb, and -- here's the worst part. they're unchristian. that's right. they practice voodoo.actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film. they got the constituents of the ritual pretty well -- cigar smoke, rum spitting, the sacrificial chicken. they only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer. they should have read metraux on voodoo.otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions. what was done to jaqueline bissett by the voodoo-practitioners in "the deep" is done here to a friend of seagal's. what was done to john wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "mcq" is done here to seagal himself. at the movie's very opening, when seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his dea career so he's now happily retired, and when we are introduced to his friends and family, i tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if i could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge.the acting doesn't really require much comment. but charles, the jamaican cop, played by tom wright, is really pretty good. wright has considerable range. here, he's an associate of dubious allegiance, rather sinister. but in "the pentagon wars" he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly.the jamaicans never flew as movie villains. i don't know why exactly. it's a small movie market. and if you go to jamaica stick to montego bay. however, if you want to see jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies, and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick, this should be a satisfying view.

so seagal plays a dea detective named john hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into, surprise surprise, colombia! not to brag or anything, but my father was born and raised in colombia (hence my last name), and now he's a doctor in california, so no matter what the movies would have you believe, there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of colombia!at any rate, in a drug bust gone bad, hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked colombian prostitute, inspiring him to go to confession, somewhere that i have never seen him go before in any of his movies, before or since. it was actually pretty interesting. seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt, whether by a stripper or by a lover, never piques the slightest bit of interest from him. he's all get-the- bad-guys all the time. but in the confession booth, he confesses to having lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence, and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (i hope i'm not getting in trouble with god by telling you this¬Ö). the priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to retire from the force. the next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper-thin characterization characteristic of seagal's films. marked for death is the story of seagal against a band of mystic jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylight.hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach, max (a minimal effort by keith david), and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread-locked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookworm-looking high school girls.maybe i just had a sheltered experience in high school, but i didn't know crack dealers and crackheads hung out at school in the middle of the day. at any rate, it's not long before hatcher learns how evil these guys are. they're not just peddling crack to high school kids, but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs, they engage in smartass stare-downs with max, and since that's not enough, his 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse.ah, ok. we get the picture. i'm sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women, and maybe steal candy from children too, just for good measure. is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are? 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. wow.anyway. not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie name-calling, where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue, but they also don't know how they should act. the leader of the drug dealers, is named screwface, and i suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is. screwface is a cartoonish jamaican man with these bright, bizarrely green eyes, which i am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head. his favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever he's yelling at. this guy likes to get so into guys' faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don't touch. all i could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath.man, they do not want you to forget that these guys are jamaican, by the way. their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie it's nearly impossible to understand them. not that it matters. it doesn't matter what they're saying, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug-related thing, they're just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people. the movie must have been a huge hit in jamaica!my biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics, particularly of the bad guys, as i've described, are spectacularly goofy, even for a seagal film. they are so cartoonish and weird that it's impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b-movie creation, something slapped together to provide fodder to whom seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smack-down retribution. but there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird. for example, a mystic, i guess you would call her, at one point puts some kind of curse on screwface by (if i remember correctly) spitting mouthfuls of bacardi onto a live rooster that's hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of screwface. hmm. interesting. sadly, it's this same woman that warns hatcher that his family has been "marked for death" by these people, meaning they've got some voodoo hex on them. not to belittle anyone, but if i was told that my family had been cursed by people like that, i would just laugh at it. hatcher doesn't strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses! but the set-up, as you can see, is pretty standard for a seagal film. unique villains, i guess you could say, although not very impressive. definitely the weirdest film of seagal's early career¬Ö

marked for death (1990) spends more time on action sequences, than it does with focusing on its characters. after his first two impressive efforts, above the law (1988) and hard to kill (1989), this third steven seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make him look good.seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick-'em-up antics of chuck norris or jean claude van damme.in marked for death, seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation. this film contains loads of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than to please rowdy moviegoers, who are unable to distinguish between action pictures that tell a story and those that simply pour on the thrills without rhyme or reason. and he deserves some real blame for this lapse in taste as a producer of "marked for death."seagal plays john hatcher, a retired dea agent who comes home to chicago, where his family is being attacked by a jamaican street gang, who attack his sister's house, and the film proves that it isn't squeamish when hatcher's niece (danielle harris) is shot in the crossfire. hatcher gets mad, and he decides to team up with his old friend, max (keith david), a school gym teacher, and charles (tom wright), a jamaican cop.naturally, hatcher declares war on the chief bad guy, a dread-locked jamaican voodoo priest called screwface (basil wallace), a nickname that apparently means "outrageous overacting." and it is almost unbelievable in the way seagal picks off various members of the gang: he gouges one guy's eyeball, he breaks a guy's back, and he breaks numerous arms and limbs.all logic for this movie is thrown out the window- -through the glass, that is. why aren't hatcher and friends indicted for all the property damage they cause or the body count that piles up? and how did they get their cache of automatic weapons from illinois to jamaica by plane without being detected? seagal has a clint eastwood stoicism about him that fans once seemed to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he's played in as many films, each dresses in oriental black bathrobes, and wears a ponytail. one of the problems that i have with some of seagal's movies is that the main characters never seem to be in serious jeopardy, and because he's the star, of course, no one can lay a glove on him, except for the bad guy.seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most of the plot lines and action sequences. regardless of whether he's masquerading as a ship's cook, a fire fighter, or an l.a. cop wearing love beads, seagal is always seagal, which is exactly what his fans want. in fact, the sameness of these films is such that, if i wanted to, i could take an old review, change the names, and have a reasonably accurate take on the new movie. not that i'd ever really do that...

just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i did'nt have anything else to do. went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments. and what do i find? every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky! i would'nt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck-ass movie i thought that i could.the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast. the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson (think i got the name right) as he were overacting, especially when he was high. the rest was'nt as bad as him but no one was good neither. i ain't no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much.... except it sucked though. no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life to. and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys, but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters. i hate when they do that in movies, same thing in the doors, even though i like that movie more. don't have any energy left to write more... it sucked! don't buy or watch it!

i love the beach boys and their music. so, being that i am a filmmaker, i thought, wow, a beach boys movie sounds great. well, wrong! i just actually turned off hdnet, the channel the movie was playing on, because it was so bad. someone above mentioned about editing... well, they should have at least looked at the monitors while they were filming. i don't know if anyone else caught the mustache falling off the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife and then he smoothed it back on with his hands. ever heard of re-taking a scene! acting was terrible. direction was terrible. make-up was terrible!!! possibly the worst make-up job i have ever seen. brian wilson's "fat" cheek's looked like pl-ado. this is honestly the first time i have ever commented on imdb, and i know it really doesn't make a difference... but come on, what the hell were the producers thinking?!?!!?

another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is. i especially remember the scene when brian says he's to quit touring and the other boys calls him traitor. i didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. a movie about the beach boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. the sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group. hard-core fans like myself knew that this isn't the entire true story and that's why i gave it a low rating 3. however it is the best movie about the beach boys i've seen so far, that says quite a bit about the other movies. if you want the truth i recommend the documentary endless harmony.

while not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys history.basically, this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho. in fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a tv movie so what do you expect? mike love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius. yeah, as if...on the plus side, the music is excellent. unlike the previous beach boys made-for-tv bio-pic "summer dreams", this movie actually features real beach boys music, rather than anemic cover versions...also, it features a surprising number of beach boys-related rarities and seldom-heard tracks - the sunrays "i live for the sun" being but one example.this movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv. part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top. by the time part two rolls around, the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs - but how could anyone take this crap seriously? if you're not a beach boys fan you probably won't get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and one-sided view of the band's history. but then again, why would you watch this if you weren't a fan?

you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic. these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine, walk around in a daze, looking like they'd rather be any place, but there.the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic. in these days of political correctness, a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now. it should have been better done back then.kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregon's willamette valley. being he's an ex-politician, he rates above the hoi ploi he's leading. the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon, but a carriage to lead the train.you think that's ludicrous, you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant, played by roy glenn to whip him. i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn, but trust me, it's bad.robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored. there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas, but mitchum just saunters through the film above it all.maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas, a widower, to have an eye on mrs. widmark, played by lola albright. now she's the best looking thing in the movie.the film billing says introducing sally field. this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days. she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee. we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon, legs akimbo and inviting. of course she gets taken up on her invitation.her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train, but one large trailer park on the move. despite this film, sally field went on to a two oscar career. what that woman had to overcome.victor mclaglen's son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess. shame on andrew mclaglen, he's certainly done better in his career.and so will you, unless you're a stargazer.

the only reason i checked this film out was to see the "early" kim bassinger. that, and the fact that my tv guide said it was a "gripping suspense", and it was three-star rated. the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not. robert culp turns in what has to be the "disaster" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. at one point, everybody is a suspect, including a frail old woman. if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written, badly directed, badly acted movie...then go for it. it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison. i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back.

***spoilers*** this movie - called eaten alive here in the uk is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. a sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the new guinea jungle. what follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. the cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. the cast are awful except for janet agren as the female lead who is excellent. look out for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint! my rating - 1 out of 10.

uuuuaaa! barf! yuk! yuk! disgusting! puke city! worst piece of junk ever made. sick. weird. horrible. enough said. hold your nose. don't eat. after seeing this sick, demented, garbage pail of a movie, you won't be able to eat your food for a week. but, maybe that's good. a new diet has been invented. go to see this vomit inducing film. get sick to your stomach. and you will be so turned off by the whole mess, that you can't eat for at least a week, and you drop about 15 pounds.me me lay! with a name like this, it's really amazing that she doesn't have a "cult" fan following. she rates as the worst actress ever. her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind. this movie rates a minus 10.

i recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'eaten alive') talk about dreadful! any movie ed wood ever put out looks like oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. to be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as "these people (cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me" classic! the mad 'jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter. i think he was the only actor not to be dubbed in (badly), if these italians must have american characters in their films why dont they get americans to dub in the dialogue instead of english people trying their best to sound like annie oakley. i'll give this 3 out of 10, i'll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedies out these days.

why is it that in the '50s and '60s, italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? probably because art films didn't make any money. , the cannibal movie, unlike the zombie movie, which was created by americans and `exploited' by italians, is a purely italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday. the director, umberto lenzi, hadn't even hit his stride yet; his genre classic, cannibal ferox, was still a year away.in plotting similar to (read: ripped off from) ruggero deodato's seminal cannibal classic, cannibal holocaust, a woman (janet agren) receives word from the police that they've received a 8mm film from her sister. she's gone missing in africa, and it's suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it. mel ferrer, as a professor of somethingoranother, tells her that a man named jonas (ivan rassimov) has started a jonestown-like cult in new guinea, and that's where the sister is. the woman hires a guide (robert kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. and, wouldn't you know it, the jungle is full of cannibals. one sentence should sum it up: if you've seen on cannibal movie, you've seen them all, mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other (lenzi copied cannibal holocaust to make this film, and retooled this to make cannibal ferox; deodato copied parts of this for hit and run). and because they all share the same material, they all feature the same traits: awful photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, overacting, and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran. rassimov and kerman have a scenery eating contest. agren exists solely to be naked, raped, or in peril. plenty o' gore for all the sickos out there. the cannibals, who do actually appear to be native cannibals, eat lunch met disguised as human flesh. and, in the grand tradition of cannibal movies, any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter. overall, really not a good experience, but i'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining. i know i did.

umberto lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. janet agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. it turns out the sister is part of a jim jones type religous cult in new guinea. she hires a scruffy guide played by robert kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. this is another (!) cannibal movie, and i probably would have liked it if not for lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior "the man from deep river." i mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film, which i guess makes him about as credible as al adamson. i felt ripped off. ***spoiler*** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.

this movie contains real animals been killed, like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open. i find this totally deranged and sick, and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash.this movie is so stupid and daft, that it has no logic at all.there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother viewing this trash for that, if you want to see boobs and sex, watch a porno instead. there is also rape scenes in this movie, which i found disgusting, like women been raped and cut up, and eaten. this movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks, seeing people been cut up and eaten.a lot of the animals, like the monkey that appeared in this movie, there is none in the jungles of new guinea. the local characters, most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea. it looks like, this movie was made around the grounds of a resort, which i bet it was.stay away from this trash, its sick and deranged.

a snore gore. i saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the cameo movie house (now the famous crobar night-club)on washington avenue on south beach in 1980 or 81. i was 17, and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. the theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. they didn't miss a darn thing. the worst acting ever.these actors deserve the academy award for the worst, and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema. joke was, the theater was showing another mi mi lay(a great name at least!) stinker...barf city. enough said. if you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills. over 12, you will be snoring after the opening credits. it's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie. and to think, it's considered a "cult" classic. yuk!!!!

"eaten alive" goes down much easier than ruggero deodato's "cannibal holocaust," but it's also a far more sillier film. i mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. tough guy robert kerman (cannibal holocaust) teams up with janet agren (the gates of hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of new guinea for agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (ivan rassimov). along the way, they fall witness to (sometimes real) animal torture and some cheesily rendered cannibalism. as directed by umberto lenzi, the movie is so over-the-top it's hard to take seriously, but if you enjoy trash cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs, it's not bad.4/10

eaten alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's cannibal ferox. the characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a pg-13. even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. the only mildly shocking scene involves crazy jonas, going a bit goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic. my beloved wife, she of the 'romeo and juliet collector's edition', watched this movie without so much as a wince of disgust! and it calls itself a cannibal movie! all-in-all, a pretty lame effort that thoroughly betrays the cannibal tradition. cannibal ferox, luci's follow-up, is a far superior example of the genre.

largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman & employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren's missing sister.despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardona's "guyana - crime of the century". lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion. with sister in toe, kerman & agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the "green inferno", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites.one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures. this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success.was it the so called "amazonian natives" who looked like they were bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in sri lanka), or the inept "decapitation" and "castration" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in "cannibal holocaust"? you can decide. without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved. most unsatisfying.as with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.if there are any redeemable features at all, kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (agren, lai and senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.

i love umberto lenzi's cop movies -- rome armed to the teeth is my favorite -- and his desert commandos pretty much legitimized the italian euro war phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.what a shame it is then to encounter his eaten alive and cannibal ferox. they could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script. lenzi then went out and executed his films the same way that a guy at mcdonald's fixes a batch of french fries. of the two, eaten alive is the more original -- which is kind of amazing considering that it features extensive footage copped from three other cannibal movies -- and easier to enjoy than cannibal ferox, though not much.i will let others outline the plot: what fascinated me about the film is how staged it all looks, and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this film has as some sort of all-out assault on good taste. it isn't, though the film is an exercise in bad taste, complete with a title-earning scene where two of the pretty supporting ladies are quite literally sliced up and eaten alive by cannibals which is the film's high point. the problem is that lenzi lets us get a good, long look at the cannibal feast scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season star trek episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots. and i don't know about anyone else, but if someone was slicing off pieces of my person and eating them i wouldn't just lie there and look distressed.my problem with the film might be that i have a lot of respect for lenzi as a filmmaker, and again this could have been directed by anybody. all of your cannibal movie conventions are touched on but it never feels like they are filmed with any real conviction, other than to try and bully ruggero deodato out of the sandbox. the two directors certainly must have known each other and either had a sort of juvenile rivalry or an actual dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to upstage them. lenzi invented the cannibal genre with man from deep river, deodato blew it away with jungle holocaust, lenzi fired back with eaten alive, deodato blew him (and everyone else) away with the superior cannibal holocaust, and lenzi fired a last parting salvo with cannibal ferox, which is about as realistic as that krazy glu commercial where the guy superglues his hardhat to a girder and hangs in midair.this film is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss with everything holy than ferox, which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to upstage cannibal holocaust. this one is more of a mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a jim jones like suicide cult -- the cannibals seem like they were added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the film. i think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of lenzi's films looking for something new by the formidable director. it isn't as entertaining as slave of the cannibal god, adventurous as his own man from deep river and certainly lacks the wallop of cannibal holocaust. combine those considerations with the recycled footage, stomach churning scenes of animal violence, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stagy, wooden methodology of film-making and what you get ends up being an ok jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes, and umberto lenzi was capable of so much more.4/10; gore freaks will go nuts however.

an asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in niagara falls and new york city before getting run over by a car. sheila morris (former miss sweden janet agren, given a hilarious "southern belle" dub to show she's from alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister diana (paola senatore) and sets out to investigate. this brings her to new guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (robert kerman i.e. american porn star r. bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. after barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate diana, who's under the control of jim jones-type cult leader jonas melvyn (ivan rassimov). jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out lsd, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from jungle holocaust or man from deep river (both of which were also directed by lenzi). i'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from cannibal holocaust as well. here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes (gutting a gator; natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and a castration. me me lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. mel ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn't given much to do.so anyway, with mangiati vivi! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you're a sleaze hound, by all means watch it. personally, i got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end. the original (heavily cut) u.s. release in 1985 was titled the emerald jungle in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting john boorman's emerald forest. it was also called doomed to die and eaten alive by cannibals!

eaten alive is a little film that opens in new york city and the arctic where tribe men shoot snake venom at a few people,then a woman enters the police precinct who's trying to find her sister that has disappeared after 6 months sheila is from alabama,but her accent sucks,she is teamed up with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say it a lot throughout the film.they venture through the amazon only to find a community with people and they find the sister,they're confronted by a mad man who has probably seen one too many jim jones preaches.he will bring them to a better place,it could be heaven but no,mark and sheila find out later its actually a suicide cult.why do i call eaten alive a "little film"? ill tell you but when i watched it,i was floored through all the run ins with the cannibals,robert kerman has a different role than his professor in cannibal holocaust.he's a bit annoying,once we meet him at an arm wrestling match that looked like russian roulette we know hes one tough guy.plus the strong misogyny just makes you cringe and it looked like i saw it somewhere,oh the scenes of animals killing each other.but the whole film revolves on those scenes,its like were actually watching a images of nature with parts of a film but after watching this film i realized that most of the films scenes are taken from other cannibal films,even the demise of 2 of the characters,well..most of the film is.that's why i call this a little film,when i did found out that scenes were borrowed i felt like throwing the disc across the room,this isn't a film just a simple montage of sorts .

one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the "cannibal connoisseur." are there such people? i didn't know. but if you are one of them, hey, have a ball. the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow (pun intended), even if, like me, you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur. i have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now, although i never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and i guess i owe my short-lived interest in these groan-inducing movies, strangely enough, to china's total disregard for copyright laws. you see, i bought a two-disc dvd collection of all of wesley snipes' films for 20 yuan (about $2.75), which turned out to include last cannibal world, mountain of the cannibal god, eaten alive, cannibal holocaust, next, with nicholas cage, and something called voodoo lagoon, along with blade 1-3, in chinese. nice.being a second sequel, i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities, shooting unsuspecting americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed. having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary, it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland. later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a "training exercise." lock up your daughters! before long the movie settles into the old missing sister routine, as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister, who looks nothing like her in any way, but she's willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesn't matter. it seems that, after shooting one of his victims, the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie, not used to big city life, ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van. the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing sheila's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior, but other than the film, the guy is a complete mystery. as the piteous police chief laments, "we know nothing about him except that he's dead!" poor guy, he must be getting a headache from all this. i recommend a nap. luckily, sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in the search for her sister. perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature, since the police are clearly going to be no help.obviously, nothing new is added to this miniscule sub-genre. quite the contrary, cannibalism almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie, about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements. thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature, a process they call "purification." personally, i prefer just peeing outside occasionally.one of my favorite parts of the movie is when sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he took a three-day weekend from the office to appear in this movie. as he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her, "if you don't believe in jonas and purification (through pain), god help you." he then gives her a shot and, when she winces from the tiny pinch, he politely apologizes to her. i sense a true believer in this guy!as far as the gore, there are plenty of nasty sound effects over random shots of animals getting slaughtered and more than enough disgusting footage of women being cut up and eaten alive, so i guess right there the movie lives up to its name. the acting is astonishingly bad, as can be expected, and interestingly enough, the editing is also spectacularly botched but still strangely effective. unfortunately, i think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in utterly insane cults in order to relate to anyone in the movie. there are plenty of outlandish religious ceremonies that take place, which make it more and more difficult to understand why sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. i'm all for individualism and doing your own thing, but come on. after a while the movie descends even further into your basic, run of the mill escape movie, just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of glory, glory hallelujah in film history. wow. note: in this movie, a woman is raped with a severed snake. if you need any more reason never to watch it, seek professional help. avoid this mess at all costs.

this movie was flippin awful....i wanted those hours of my life back. for god's sake, -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. its not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. and where do i begin? the dumb a** kids in the movie.....the zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? or the very bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@! my god, it never ended!.....i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor, then sit through this one again.but what do you expect? most people with the brain power to look up reviews, are not going to be the target audience here at all- so go see pirites 2 again, or the jet lee one, -if your debating to yourself. look, this movie will just cost you your soul, your money, your energy, and your brain cells. heed the warning.

a group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s. they each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago. this new guy wants everyone's power for himself.this not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. yes, there is magic and all that supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie. a very mediocre action movie. focusing almost solely on being cool and slick and paying only minimal attention to the plot, which has plenty of sadly unused room for interesting twists. but none were put in and even before the movie is half over you'll know what is being played and by whom.there are a few good scenes here and there, most notably an exploding car that is magically reconstructed after colliding with a big rig, but that's about it. what's worse is that director renny harlin, who has some very entertaining if not smart movies to his credit, relies heavily on blasting metal music and overly sexy leads to carry that film and that makes it quite possibly the silliest "horror" movie since the disastrous "alone in the dark." it is not as bad as "alone in the dark" since the few slick scenes are actually slick and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the highest this film can hope for is a nice and cozy home on late night cable. 3/10rated pg-13: violent action

think 'charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. a very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. i'd suggest a 'charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'charmed' kicked ass and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! wait and watch it on dvd on a rainy sunday when you've got nothing better to do. or better yet download it so you don't waste your money. the first 15 minutes were alright. but the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when reid says : "kiss my ass harry potter", while driving of a cliff. although they are not worthy to kiss potter's ass, because potter is way cooler and at least his movies have a story. the goblet of fire was even scarier than this!!!

ok...before i even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie i'd like to say a few words which come from the heart... this movie sucks!!!! don't go to see it unless you really like sweaty boy-bands and wooden-acting, no-plot stories.. so, let's go to why i think the movie is so bad: 1. there is not story line. there is no plot. the director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasn't there. 2. the whole thing looks like a big, hour and a half promotion for some kind of goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like-"bsb"-band... all guys in school have perfect abs, no fat or ugly young people... there is no good looking girl in the movie as well, not one. the main character is either wet in the swimming pool, or all sweaty in his bed... poor guy. must be awful to go on a date sweating like that. 3. can those guys do something good with their powers? anything good? like put off the fire in that old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other. 4. wooden acting. the main character only has two expressions on his face. expression number one: sad. expression number two: trying to look seductive but still seems sad... in that boy band there are 4 guys: the main characted, his best friend who got into the accident, the blondy, and the fourth one... what was the name of the fourth one? i think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film: once in the beginning ( he said the jumping from the cliff using "the power" won't kill them) and second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl... the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice... anyways, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this film. guys - do not go to see it. there is very little action, no suspense, no hot girls. girls - a least the actors are good looking... what i would advise you people is to get a soundtreck of this movie - that's the only thing i liked about it.

the story was disjointed, the acting was not of any callibre you can catagorise. more of a serial pilot than an actual movie. i wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it. whatever it was that made the lost boys so likable was obviously absent here. altho it tried hard. plot hooks were clumsily placed amidst what could have been an episode of dawsons creek with dark clothes, and the story arc was going nowhere soon. very disappointing for me. the end scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of the story planned his whole scheme.. who was he (or she) trying to kid, talk about naive. stick with films of this kind of genre from the eighties, when they had more of an idea.

i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production. the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.the story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of ipswitch a survivors of the salem witch trials. they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called "the covenant". their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive. in theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movie¬Öor at least an interesting teeny flick.but there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential. that acting wasn't good, the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues. for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job. the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing.the movie has it's moments, but overall was a little disappointing.a witchy 4/10

the tv ads for this movie showed the warlocks hitting a truck head-on, then getting smashed to bits and reforming on the other side of the truck. i thought the special effects were good, but the general style of the movie was wimpy. this is the "charmed" tv series with three boys instead of three girls.the big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and consolidate all their power. besides driving into trucks, these kids can fly up the sides of houses, climb out of windows, push each other into stacks of garbage, and make the veins in their necks pop out. but if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and feeble. the father of one of the boys is evidence of this, as he sits in an attic made up to look like a mummy but he is only 45 years old.the three good warlocks are each filthy rich in his own right, completely spoiled, obnoxious, and annoying. in any public school, these kids would be beaten up every day. their glares and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the boys from the hood. unfortunately for all good people, these charmed boys were sent to hogwart's reform school for the warlocks that couldn't get into harry potter's class.so what was the movie all about? three teenagers acting out with each other and their girlfriends. one other teenager who envies their power and money and happens to be a lost relative. after a few scenes where the charmed boys show off their powers and have sex with their girlfriends; the movie gets around to the unknown warlock teen's revenge plot. the predictable stuff happens. the bad warlock ambushes various friends of the other warlocks, and eventually starts attacking them too. the final confrontation happens, and that is about it.the special effects are not bad, but nothing special. if you like to see fireballs, spiders, and blue veins, then this is a good movie to watch.

most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate. it is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life. there is about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments. our actress are treated like pieces of ass, and seem to be perfectly happy with their position. the lead characters, these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store. you can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them. the story steps all over itself and when it finally gets to the final battle, its no more than a volleyball match that doesn't last long enough to make up with this trashed script raped from the o.c.

anyone who rates this movie above a 3 has a very distorted view of movies, anyone who rated this piece of sh!t 7 or higher, i have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies, and doubt they have ever seen a good one. i am always up for giving any movie a shot and i did with this one, i tried to pay attention, i tried not to let my money go 2 waste but 15 minutes in my friends were laughing at me cause i was listenin 2 my ipod, 25 minutes later i couldn't even watch the overacting that was occurring within the film, so i up and left, i have never ever ever walked out of a movie, until this garbage, anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar, or they should be banned from this site. i get so angry when i see a person rate this an 8 when the godfathers overall rating is a 9.1 its like saying that that movie was close which it isn't.

from the beginning of this film,with it's "the lost boys" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. "the covenant" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who i am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. at least i hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! this movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that. the story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. they could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes, however someone decided,(maybe the director, but i don't know if anyone really "directed" this movie) that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed "artsy" camera shots, and nonsensical scenes of the "boys" swimming and getting into bar fights. about half way through this film i thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining, and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling i had for continuing to watch it. . so i did bash my head against a wall, and i did enjoy it more then the movie! i watched it all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment. nope,my efforts were rewarded with "how about i make you my whee-aytch!" i vomited, and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel. the acting really wasn't as bad as other reviewers seemed to think, but even the most talented thespian could not saved this work, and work it did, on my nerves! i give movies a chance, even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment, and this actually wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen. after it was over i did feel like watching the movie "stealth" again and wow it was so much better this time around! oh yeah case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't. watch a few episodes of "charmed", and watch "the lost boys" after having a fair amount of alcohol, and you will be a much better person. if you do fall into the same trap that i did and watch "the covenant", make sure to keep all sharp objects far, far away from yourself, you'll thank me for it.

if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood bigwigs, i'm sure it would sound like this: me: "four boys at a private high school are good friends, and they are witches."hollywood: "that sounds like "the craft." me: "no, no, i said four boys, not four girls." hollywood: "that still sounds like "the craft", just with boys instead of girls." me: "ok, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power."hollywood: "still not much difference, because one of the girls in "the craft" also wanted more power.me: "ok, ok... i'll make these boys part of the "in crowd", they'll be rich, and the school is on the east coast.hollywood: "now that sounds original. that is nothing like "the craft", here's a billion dollars." this movie was so clich√© and uninspiring. even the manufactured drama between chase and the brothers of ipswich was very blas√©. a bunch of rich kids, with their biggest problem being what color bentley they want for their 18th birthday (and 18th car), don't interest me at all, even if they have powers. every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine, and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80% nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are. i wanted to rename this movie "the witches of o.c.". oooh, rich kids and their problems... let me pretend to care.this film was completely unimaginative and predictable. the final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti-climatic. this was a movie best left on the cutting room floor.

i feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10. okay, noted that the special effects are, 'okay' and renny harlin did make one my favorite genetically-altered-sharks-attack-a-research-station movie, that of which you may know as deep blue sea. also, the opening credits are done fairly well with a remix of whitezombie's "more human then human' and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this 'movie'. but enough praise, lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so much.not since uwe boll's alone in the dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted. okay, our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families, each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft. oh and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, all go to the same school, are all on the swim team and all, for some reason or another, sit in bed with their shirts off, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. i have nothing against gays, gothic or thirteen year old's, but that is what this movie is aimed at...13 year old goth who question their sexuality. yeah there's girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever, but how come they don't take their shirts off? hey its only fair.anyways, the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18, they will ascend and be granted new profound, almost god-like powers. but before i go any further, i forgot to mention that when they use their powers, they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it. that explains why they got people in their late 20's to play 17 year old's. oh and if something needs explaining, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog. god this movie sucks...where was i? oh yeah, the ascension part.okay, apparently there was a super-secret-alpha-one family that the others forgot about or some s#*t like that, i don't know, i was dozing off at this point. but they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is befriending the group is 'secretly' one of these descendants from the fifth family. and i say 'secretly' because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. he has greater power then the others because he's older i think. anyways, bob loblaw (say it out loud) things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie.to be honest, i was all game for a witch battle. you know like saurmon vs. gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle, because you know, this is about witches and stuff. now, when these two witches throw down, its more of like...how can i put it...a very, very crappy version of a dragonball z type battle. they throw stuff at each other, talk, throw stuff, talk, throw stuff, talk etc. when i say 'throw stuff' i only say that because i have no clue what the f#%k their throwing at each other. it looks like big gobs of slimy water. god this movie sucks, anyways, when our main witch 'ascends' he doesn't get very powerful at all. he just throws bigger gobs of slimy water. things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gonna end. the good witch wins bad witch loses.you know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as, 'i'm gonna make you my wiotch' thats where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this whole...thing.yes, i admit, the thought of witches doing battle, using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool, but when the execution is this bad, i really wished they didn't make this movie. maybe if it was r-rated, had tit's and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore, it might have worked...might have worked.if your interested in watching this, don't buy it or even rent it. wait for it to come on tv or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it. just don't waste your time with this hack of a movie. if you spend any money on it, there's a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by uwe boll called, the covenant 2: alone in the dark with the house of the dead.

"no one really knows how the power came to be. not even the book of damnation recorded its beginning, but those who mastered it have always been hunted¬Ö the families of ipswich formed a covenant of silence¬Ö bla bla bla" after this intro, we suddenly see take that. or was it n'synch? the backstreet boys, perhaps? well, i don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing's for sure: the descendants of salem are a boy-band. can you tell them apart? i couldn't. if you can tell me which is which, i'd very much appreciate it. these boy-band boys looks so damn alike¬Ö! seriously now. is this a horror movie or a film for teenie-boppers? it's sad that the (anyway weak) horror genre has been kidnapped by teens. and this is one of the teeniest i've seen so far. the movie is visually solid, but the cast is so bland, the acting so awful, that it was a trial finishing the movie. as bad as the cast was (after all, boy-bands and fashion models are rarely good actors) the absolute "stand-out" in this regard was the guy playing the villain, sebastian stan. this guy's overacting is right up there with the worst in the history of film. i have rarely seen someone make such annoying and silly grimaces in such a short space of time. what's worse, he has the most baby-face of all the boy-band baby-faces in the entire cast. i mean, it's a joke.

wow! i just don't even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful. maybe i should start by just saying that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and protagonist, i had to leave the theater because i was laughing so hard. yeah. the acting really was that bad. the acting was not even the worst part though. the plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. the characters are all grossly underdeveloped. the dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. the bad guy is a caricature of an out of control, power drunk, sadist.but hey the actors are pretty, so guess that was supposed to make it all better.

when i saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10 i assumed they were unaware that the score wasn't out of 100. this is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term. poorly written and weakly directed with so-called actors unable to act, but able to grimace when ordered to. for the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction, then it changes tack and gets involved in a power fight, with extremely poor special effects. unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers, the "writer" cheats. it is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story-line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement. not that the write would even know the word "denouement." some movies go directly to dvd. this one should have gone directly to the dustbin.

let me say first off i didn't go in expecting much, and watching it at prime-time on opening night should have helped. i believe it would have, had there been more than 20 people in the theater. it sucked so hard. the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. i guess that was their way of twisting the plot; keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot.unknowns until the end of the movie: -what the eff is a dark-ling? the cg was cool but i want to understand! -why cant powers be willed? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -why is willing away powers so bad? your just normal after, right? -who farted?roughly 50% of the minutes with just men on screen, were shots of them in wife beaters, sleeveless t's and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the skimpiest low riding speedos knowing to ever have been manufactured. i swear you could see the start of the one guys.... well, it was close to soft-core. and of course there was a shower scene, and to mix it up it was of the dudes. butt cracks were abundant, a sausage fest in progress. but there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she ambles around the best looking dorm bathroom for around 12 minutes. then there was a girl talk pj party. the other thing i couldn't get over was the amount of driving that caleb did in his super cool ford mustang gt. it was a ford commercial for around 1/4th of the movie.don't see it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it could be worth it. but don't expect anything breathtaking.

it seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. don't get me wrong, i'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all i'm interested in is highly offensive. take the convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. this is essentially the craft with (supposedly) hot guys. and, yeah, that's it. it bored me to tears. even my friend, who usually laps us crap films, hated it. it is really stunningly bad, to the extent where it can actually be funny. i would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it. they were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the (really clich√©) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end. watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film. i don't think mainstream, hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone) so i think i'll give up. unless you're a teen who likes the pussycat dolls, thinks paris hilton is "hot" and watches mtv it's like some sort of wasteland. life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house. :( p.s. someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members "totally hawt lol!!!111!!"

basic summary: ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped the salem witch hunts by forming a covenant of secrecy. the first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers, and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers.well, i usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5, going from there:production: -1 for very obvious audio out of sync, +1 for nicely done special effects, the darkling actually gave me chills, +0.5 for nice colorization (i like the dull blue), -0.5 for the stupid sound track, +0.5 for the opening sequence -- i'm a sucker for stylish compositing and flashy title design.story / script: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for dbz/matrix/street fighter ripoff/pastiche, -1 for not explaining some plot threads very well (spiders, darkling), -1 for boring, predictable ending, -1 for gratuitous exposition, both as words on the screen and as bland monologuingacting / characterization: -0.5 for bad bad acting, although it gets a little better as the film progresses, -1 for lack of character development, especially among all the femalesother: +1 for gratuitous male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for no sex scenes, which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot, +1 for hitting its target audience, teenage sci-fi/horror/thriller fans, even though this movie is not exclusively any of those genres.conclusion: this is not a "film," this is a movie. there's really nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) clean fun. lots of really attractive actors and actresses. lots of boys fighting in the style of dbz and street fighter. if you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and/or mindlessly fun plots, this movie is for you. if you prefer oscar-worthy, exquisitely-produced film masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably won't like this film.using my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.

oh boy. films like this really bother me. if this movie is supposed to close to truth, then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started. in the movie, rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before. well i can't imagine that rommel wouldn't have known something about hitler's government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities. with that in mind, i have a problem with a movie that makes rommel's life at the end a tragic one. he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him? i can't do it. i also can't buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war, the allies would have had more trouble winning it. if more competent people were in charge, wwii may never have started in the first place. from a movie watching aspect, the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles. leo g. carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents. but other than that not very essential.

i hoped to learn something from this movie, but i was disappointed. it is all about rommel and lauds him as a great general, but at no time in this entire movie did we ever get an idea of why he was great. what made him so successful? was it his drive, his unwillingness to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? i was looking for a patton-like rendition that really gets into the character, but this fell way flat. most of the dialog is contrived and sensationalized, and feels stale and artificial. there is some good action here and there, but not much. the tail end of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plot to assassinate hitler, was the most informative part and probably the most interesting. but as a history lesson on germany's greatest general, this was a failure.

despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, erwin rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. and that's probably true. rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint. he does his job, trying to win the war for hitler, but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders, which rommel (james mason) expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never, ever disobeys. only when it's patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him; this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film, a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing.mason is fine as rommel, but it's hardly a memorable performance along the lines of, say, george c. scott as patton. of course, rommel wasn't as colorful as patton, but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting. he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie (a young jessica tandy, well-cast), but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance ¬ñ as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves (though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitler).done on the cheap, with any battle scenes swiping stock footage, and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia, there's nothing to particularly recommend this film. a remake could be interesting (i'd pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and, well, harris can act) were it spiced up a little, but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years; a biography this bland would never cut it any more.

for me this movie was a disappointment. somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii. but there is none of that, it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries, in a way, to whitewash him. so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business, without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour. such real life people just do not make good movie material. i almost feel sorry for james mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character. actually, a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie ¬ñ with the exception of luther adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of adolf hitler.there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world. famous british actors impersonating germans are just not credible. rommel, for example, is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical ¬Ñsoutherner" from baden-w√ºrttemberg. you immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain kind of wit, a certain way of seeing the world (the total opposite of eg a prussian ¬Ñjunker"). i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th, many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the advancing bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever).the best movie portrayal of an intellectual, intelligent military mind is in my opinion still patton (1970). incidentally, general patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie, a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles. the open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible!

perhaps it's just me, but this movie seemed more like sequel or follow-up than the separate project. why? when it was filmed (just few years after the war) most of the viewers probably knew why rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to allied, why he was hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it isn't so obvious anymore."desert fox: the story of rommel" is a decent war movie, but it's just isn't in any way explained how rommel did get his nickname, what was he doing that allied considered him as their best general, why their soldiers were so afraid of afrika korps? that's what is missing in this movie - we see his fame, his character, his way to treat soldiers and enemies, but f.e. we also see that hitler was complaining about his achievements in africa, calling him coward, etc. so, we're missing the big picture here - it is "the story of rommel", but unfortunately the "desert fox" part is missing.

most of you out there really disliked this movie... you were right. a small minority of you really loved the movie... can't say you' re wrong. for me, this movie was too stupid. i have seen many dumb, silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them. as i was watching i couldn't stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what i was seeing and trying to decide if i should laugh or cry, as *really stupid* stuff were going on on the screen, and people were leaving the theater.according to the leading characters, time travel is accomplished, just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past. plus, if you are seeking an after death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium, there you shall meet lord - sorry, loydd and be given important commands... all te above doesn' t really make sense, right? well, go ahead, watch the movie (i almost never regret the movies i watch), you probably won't like it, but you will be intrigued by the writer's ability in producing the ultimately stupid script...i' m giving it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from being the worse...

this is a stupid movie. when i saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over. i stayed to the bitter end. to show fortitude? i caught it again on television and it was much funnier. still by no means a classic, or even consistently hilarious but the family kinda grew on me. i love jessica lundy anyway. if you've nothing better to do and it's free on t.v. you could do worse.

stanley stupid (tom arnold) and his wife, joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. they have two equally challenged children, buster and petunia. one day, mr. stupid notices their garbage is gone again....there must be someone stealing it from the curb. he goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck. when he finally gets to the dump, he is startled to learn not only that "other folks garbage" has been stolen, too, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill. he is determined to defeat the garbage nappers of the world, it seems. meanwhile, petunia and buster visit the police station and a chinese restaurant in search of their parents, for joan comes up missing, too. will they bumble their way through their problems? this is just a stupid, stupid movie, with the culprit being the terrible script. the books by allard and marshall are hysterical and only a couple of situations from the books ends up in this film. arnold is actually quite nice as mr. stupid and the other cast members try very, very hard to make the film work. the production values are very high, with the dog and cat belonging to the stupids adding a little oomph to the film. but, it is all for naught, as the plot is wandering and weak. perhaps, someday, someone will take another stab at translating the very funny allard books to the big screen. therefore, if you love to laugh, rent something else while you await a new production and, by all means, go get the books, too. but, stay away from being stupid yourself, as anyone who watches this movie to the end could hardly be called intelligent.

very slow, plodding movie with a confusing story line. the movie's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals. ellen barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much-younger peta wilson. not sure what this movie was about.

this contains some spoiler information, but the movie is not worth watching anyway...why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer-director damian harris is beyond me. the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques, which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them. the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all.even more over-the-top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s/m crime belong to a large, yet secret, group of s/m lesbian executives.full of bad editing and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations - including barkin's detective salary apartment. and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep. damian is a bad writer and a bad director. he tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times. furthermore, he couldn't get ellen barkin to give 110%. i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying. standouts were peta wilson, who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part. the highly under-rated character actor, marshall bell gave his absolute best as always.and since damian couldn't deliver on any level, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. most importantly, he doesn't know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical "hollywood reality" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous.save your time, money and braincells and pass this one by.

as much as i love ellen barkin (who is really underrated) i have to boo this movie. if you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho-sexual thriller or have never watched 20/20. it's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway.overall, this movie serves to turn-on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex. not a fun movie to sit through, although if you like ellen barkin it's nice to see her place a tough lady.

this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere. subplots come in and out of nowhere, the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer's motivation is unclear to say the least. maybe they could get away with this in a porn version, but here some more clarification is needed.

mercy the movie, actually starts out as a somewhat decent film, and ellen barkin does give a strong performance. but if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare. it is always hard to brink a book onto film and unfortunatley this one ends up failing...... 3 out of 10

...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. what was the motive? the details of the murders were used, but never explained. i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. there is no thread to follow. i guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.casting is very good, i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky.not much more to say, really. but i really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious.

i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies, but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing. the evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. i started fast forwarding to see how it ended. and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. the main character, played by ellen barkin, just wasn't believable at all. peta wilson acted very well in this film, but her character was way out there and there wasn't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.

this film tried, but ultimately it was a waste of talent. it tried to hard to be "sexy." i'm not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson (who will find something besides tv's "le femme nikita" worthy of her talents.) i just didn't find, even in ms. wilson's so-called near-seduction scene with mrs. barkin any real emotion, even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work. if the sexual elements of wilson's disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart (which it didn't even by an ending it didn't deserve), neither did the murder element of the plot. perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction, but i didn't feel for anyone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie doesn't work for me. if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out: 1.) the gulity pleasure of "bound" which works well in a noir setting; and 2.) the more honest, and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hell's kitchen called "all over me." it's a well-defined indie from the mid-90's that handles that coming-of-age issue with feeling, not forced sexuality. both would be a better rental than "mercy" which has next to nothing.

i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown on the bed with the "missing eyelids", as the camera pans up and away from her face, blinks! yes, blinks! i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things! of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands. very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face. too bad.

i caught this on hbo under its category of "guilty pleasures", and i would agree that i felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. one, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "so what?". however, i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times. do i feel dirty for having watched it? yes. am i sorry i watched it? no. so, there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy, even when in a poor movie. sigh!

first of all, even imdb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is very "gappy". even main characters are missing from it like buddy for example.now back to the movie. i love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. it was horrid. probably the worst movie i have ever seen. and the reason why it bothers me so much, is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.the plot line itself is good. it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting. golden brooks was a huge disappointment. i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud, fun-loving, energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends. melodramatic roles are not for her at all. she basically killed her character, rachel.i love some of the cast, like deborah cox, mel jackson and darrin dewitt henson, but even they couldn't save this catastrophic movie. of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill harper as a man, and he didn't help me get to like him more here either.golden brooks' voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie. it seemed like she whispered throughout the whole joint. the director i won't even waste board-space on, he did such a bad job. the editing, photography/camera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad. not to mention the dialogs! absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious (when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself). as i said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was seriously messed up. i would not recommend it to anyone, unless they are cinematography major and want to see a 'what not to do' example for their future work.have a great day, everyone!!!

i have been a rabid star trek fan since 1966. still am. one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. encounter at farpoint fails in its mission.superbly produced.poorly directed, written, acted. d.c. fontana really blew this one. this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned.the first half of the first season didn't fare much better.

the series does not start as it means to go on. although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. the first ever episode of star trek: the next generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and marina sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually. otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q, and some giant jellyfish. that's right.
