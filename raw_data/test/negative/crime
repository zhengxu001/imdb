first of all, i would like to say that i am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that i rented it, i wanted to like it.i think that the main reason that i was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller. in my eyes, a suspense thriller for british movies is like something out of a ruth rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.this movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. we have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.his notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.the elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, i felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. the film might have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.this seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. i felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. i felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. so, i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.

a funny thing happened to me while watching "mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. on the other hand, the english version at least is very badly dubbed. so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time! this film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!)...miss it. (*)

this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen.i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but i cannot figure out where that came from. his co-workers find out and tease him terribly.during the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. they are all attractive, of course, else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist. he graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.like i said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.

being a long-time fan of japanese film, i expected more than this. i can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor. the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity i couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard "quirky" japanese story. if you've noticed how many japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie. seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.fans of "beat" takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.2/10

"tokyo eyes" tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. this lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and more talk. you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and get a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayada'ing. (c-)

wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th century-fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. it is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. betty grable (an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden don ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). also good: charlotte greenwood as betty's pithy aunt, a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job, and carmen miranda playing herself (who else?). the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot, and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. by the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****

cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise. elizabeth shue actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood. i literally vomited while watching this film. of course i had the flu, but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode. why can't nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor. nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor. heck nobody could do it better.the search begins for nick's contract with lucifer or was it lou cipher from "night train to terror".

i'm a huge fan of both emily watson (breaking the waves) and tom wilkinson (normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett (dellamorte dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich lord are spot-on and entertaining. but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. the music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice. too bad.i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. for example, watson's character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. and i went from disliking wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a "love story" or "steel magnolias" illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (was it the lord driving the car? the lord's dog?). the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, florence nightingale incarnate, etc. was ok until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. good god! if you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.look, everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. i'm not anti pc or anything, it just didn't ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. the ending for me was (and not the director's intention i am certain) depressing. the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together, so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. is that asking too much?my score: 4/10

so tell me - what serious boozer drinks budweiser? how many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shue's assets.cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart'.still - i did watch it to the end, by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...

a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. incredibly bad. very pretentious. it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. we don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. we don't know why. nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but i feel that this role and this script let him down. and how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed? really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath.

this film is absolutely appalling and awful. it's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes ed wood's movies look like art. the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen. an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty. no talent was used to make this film. and the female love interest has a huge bhind- italian taste maybe. even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really discerning. this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. it's actually and insult to the most stupid audience. i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this?

here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game, turkey shoot, gymkata and the running man.certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. upon discovery of the said corpse, the villains response? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all)  they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!)however, i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode (even if his screen time is very limited)not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b-movie enthusiasts.

at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final executioner'.. at least where i come from. a bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. great job on the dubbing too guys(!) best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck, he just gets out his gun and bang! why not do that earlier? it's a mystery. as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. i'm still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10

earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. well, parts of the earth, because somewhere in italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, alan (william mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like kurt russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by edra (marina costa) and erasmus (harrison muller jr. ). alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam (woody strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. as for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including ten little indians, the most dangerous game, and escape from new york. the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans.

many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying... men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today... soon u will know someone in the house has died... the dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji... one of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile, daughter is busy with her makeup... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez... another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office... then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... its anupam kher... suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed... is it his dream or a flash back? u won't get an answer until the end of the movie...well, this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee!!!!! later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream. is this a film comedy? well it is supposed to belong to that category... but it actually does not!!! there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie!!! more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police!!! so everyone must cheat the cheats!!!! or forget about justice!!!! music by bapi-tutul & dhruv dhalla is ok... nothing much to tell about other sectors... bad script destroys everything... not even anupam kher's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool...

new york family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set, which nearly ruins david niven's marriage to mitzi gaynor. bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom(and nothing sexy happens there anyway). gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on, she turns off. film's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky patty duke, pre-"miracle worker", as niven's daughter. she's delightful; "happy anniversary" is not. * from ****

the best thing about "the prey" is the tag line..."it's not human and it's got an axe"! the movie itself is a padded stinkaroo....endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die! no slasher fan will like this garbage.....watch "friday the 13th" again and burn any copy of this film you find! it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made!

this is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst slasher movies ever made. i know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by "friday the 13th". "the prey" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. the woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.but "the prey" is as bad as you might expect. i didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason. the situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. it just does not works for a slasher flick.the acting is simply horrid. the score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?! i won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.please avoid this one like the plague. it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, and that's something to say. thank god it seems to have vanished from earth.

i was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because i hadn't intended to watch it at all. now i wish i hadn't. the suspense starts out well, with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be found out, or (doable now, though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. the plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it, with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair, make for an absorbing first half. then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited, all-suffering loves. the two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other, and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. at the end of the film, in the midst of the movie's second funeral, i found myself thinking, "now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run?" the filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but i think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.

this tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary mid-sommerish version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. a well-heeled london solicitor, (tom wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. he throws up, but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.written and directed by julian fellowes, who won an oscar for writing "gosford park", (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by nigel balchin, it's quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. it's like a throw-back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. however, it's not all bad. wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson, (the adulterous wife), and rupert everett, (the highly amoral high-class totty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. tony pierce-roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye.

seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i don't quite get it. why has this been such a huge hit in 1986? its amateurishness drips from every scene. the jokes are lame and predictable. the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (that is not to say that miss rudnik does not have nice boobs!). the singing is "schrecklich". the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing, a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid-eighties. it's really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow imdbers comments).

this film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department. awful, awful, awful. it's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an andy warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve. this film is an incoherent shamblesa particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when dominic pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average english accent "god damn". to right that woman. god damn this horrendous monstrosity.everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves. let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.

ok the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all ok. but when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched ghost lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. the story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop. all the movie is shot in day(very great for a movie supposed to be horror) and there like no gore(1 scene only and it look so home-made and not credible) and near no blood(it can be considered a great thing considering the look of the blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. the story is going nowhere , it give you the impression that it never start, there so much useless scene done only to give the movie the average duration time(when the demon search the guy in the dogs thing for about 4 minutes...) way too much slow-mo things. well lets just say this movie is a z-series one and a very poor one. all cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie. it bored my all long and i'm not the guy who get bored very easily with horror movie, man i even like house of the dead and alone in the dark from uwe boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst director but here it look too much like some guys wanting to make a movie for fun. plus for us french speaker(tough i understand english i prefer to watch movie in my native language) there the usual videoville bad translation. in normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking(you have to check on lips etc) here you just have to listen to it and you know it. very cheesy

from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. lets put it this way, i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought 'i can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. the acting in this film was terrible, i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from aliens3 was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place. the storyline was mediocre and i suppose, like most films, if the rest had been done well it would have stood up. i don't usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating (must be cast/crew) i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack.

ok, it was a "risky" move to rent this flick, but i thought i had nothing to lose.well, i was wrong. this is, next to "bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" i have ever seen. crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. the soundtrack though, isn't to bad. that is why i give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. and of course the cats are a positive surprise. by far the superior actors in this movie..... do not rent or buy it. stay away from it and hope that this horrible, horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a "cult classic". it most definitely do not deserve any recognition.

spoilersi'm going to be as kind as i can about this film (some people, including directors!, can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind) so...there is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and... that's it; everything else bites the big one. all the acting is appalling, the script is embarrassing, the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers. all in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendencies.as a horror film it's not very scary and if it supposed to a "thinking man's" horror film well it succeeded on some level, i kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away. it may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and i'm missing the point but i somehow doubt it.this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone, and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly await the resurrection of british horror.if you don't agree with this review, that fine, it's just my own opinion, and i'm sure someone out there will love it (the director's mum for instance).

well, i'll begin with this: i love horror-movies, not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. second; this is the worst movie of all times. it even beats mean guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. and for that i pay it homage.however, the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed, after which point everything was so so sad. to my great surprise, the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of c-movie-crap from 7 and up; i know you're joking! good one!! hahaha! because if there is any reason in the world, and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is; you can't be for real.everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up, so i'll leave it. minor spoiler alertbut the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog-kennel for ten minutes, with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two, really does it for me.

this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen! the cast is an international one - australian-pretending-to-be-british, stage american and a character with an english name sporting an unrecognizable "european" accent. what passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity. so short were the shoestrings of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition. in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary (though not necessarily "high") quality which have been made on no budget at all. recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary "blair witch project" and of course - the most recent - that low-budget winner, saw, featuring practically unknown leads (gary elwes is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before). in darkhunters, it is shocking to find a known character actor, dominique pinon and hollywood has-been jeff fahey struggling valiantly to save the film. it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man (fahey) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines. i would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible!

hm. where do i start? i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance, but this time i wish i'd paid attention.i know some people liked it, and i'm not trying to say that they shouldn't. it was semi-amusing at some parts. but if you're like me and you don't like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random fast motion cloud scenes, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to 'thrilling' music, and close-ups of faces while people are speaking, then you might want to avoid this movie. the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top, and the film quality was awful, fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all. and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on, but... well, she doesn't really convince me otherwise. in fact, i ended up really disliking her crazy character. and what was up with the souls in space? i understand this is a fantasy movie, but come on.i will say, the angel at the end was freaking creepy. it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie, way more creepy than the darth maul lava-face demon. i give them props for that scene, it was good. but not good enough to actually see the movie. and the opening credits were great, but don't be fooled! i would've rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better.bah. i wish i hadn't bought this for even the $2 that i paid for it, i could have bought a candy bar instead. :/

first of all, i really can't understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. it's the worst thing i have ever seen. even the actors seem to be bored...and i think that says it all!however, i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators - that team seems to have a really good future. that's why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if they're watched outside this movie, it almost looks like a good movie).better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this... this "thing!".

this movie really is that bad, and i'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. seeing this is like od'ing on pure suck. now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. you may have waded through every title from full moon and troma, all the movies of edward d. wood jr, uwe boll, albert pyun and direct to dvd-flicks from faded men-of-action. you may even have seen death tunnel, ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst3k covered, but in their original form. but you do not know truly awful film-making until you have seen darkhunters. and if you haven't, you shouldn't. don't bother. not only is this movie amazingly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted and splattered in crude, cheap aftereffects. first of all, it's a pretentious mess. but not good, greenaway or lynch-style pretentious or hilariously messy in an ittenbach or early waters sort of fashion. it's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart. sort of like m. night shaymalan (sp?), only that man seems like a freakin' messiah when compared to this trainwreck (and this coming from a rampant shaymalan hater). it's also boring. not heavy going-type boring, which is okay, if the movie awards your patience. darkhunters does no such thing. it's boring in a "oh my fu(king god, if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu(king kill myself!"-kind of way.btw. anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed.

this is, arguably, the worst of the major ava gardner films. yes, she is gorgeous. but that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.in this turkey, robert walker has to pretend that he's eddie bracken (which surely embarrassed him). olga san juan plays the jane powell (golly, gee) part. dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (!), and eve arden plays helen broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). yes, the film contains a major popular song, "speak low." but check out the other, entirely forgettable, pieces. dick haymes sings very well, of course, and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava.the sets are cheap, the script is filled with clichés and failed humor, and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor (as indeed he was). in short, if you want to see ava in her prime, buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie.

i'll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time. boy was i wrong and disappointed.one touch of venus which starred mary martin, kenny baker, and john boles on broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and gardner, walker, and tom conway play the roles that martin, baker, and boles did on stage. the kurt weill-ogden nash musical with book by nash and s.j. perelman was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who reestablished herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood. look at the names that went into this show. given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production. instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay, it was like all the wit was drained out of it. doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway, but it's even too much for eve.the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner. of course when the statue goes missing, conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker, the last person to be with the statue. the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them. for reasons i don't understand, ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines. the singing is carried by dick haymes and olga san juan playing walker's friends and coworkers. of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker. you would kind of think that haymes would be playing walker's role at least. it was awkward to say the least.only three songs survived from the score, don't look now, but my heart is showing, that's him, and the incomparable speak low. haymes's silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway. for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century, ogden nash, were done over by ann ronnell. i suspect the infamous code was at work here.in lee server's biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man, howard duff. when duff and gardner reunited, walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to gardner off camera. i'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either.hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you'll get to see it the way, weill, nash, and perelman wrote it.

when naïve young eddie hatch, a window dresser at savory's department store, falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss, venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for. this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. the purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role. eddie's not just naive, but dithering and hapless. gardner is gorgeous, but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie's loving but jealous girl friend, tom conway as the suave owner of savory's and eve arden as savory's long time, wise cracking secretary. it's a role arden could play in her sleep, and she's good at it. the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big-time star. the only point of a musical, however, is to have music. since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts, kurt weill, composing, and ogden nash writing the lyrics, came up with a series of stylish, witty songs and one masterpiece. without the satire, or the clever songs or martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill/nash songs, they brought in the movie's music director, ann ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived, turning sharp observation into lovey-dovey romance. ronell was no hack; she wrote willow weep for me. wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash's clever work. the one bright spot in the movie is that weill/nash masterpiece. "speak low" is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote. it's given one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner. dick haymes contributes a chorus. as for ann ronell, she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director, as well as composer and lyric writer. yours for a song: the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business, including ronell, kay swift, dorothy fields and dana suess. and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill/nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast, you might be able to track down the cd, one touch of venus (1943 original cast) / lute song (1946 original cast). the music is paired with lute song, another broadway show that starred martin.

i enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious. rh3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. i think i may have laughed once - and it was during the ngs. tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. i was able to predict everything - who the villain was, who the girl was, (spoiler alert) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc. i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate endeavors, but not in any more rush hour sequels. it's just too tired. i recommend a rental, but not a purchase.

for a series that was inspired by kolchak, it's ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller - i've often wondered if i'm missing the point. the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires who'll drink my blood while listening to busted, but that's a risk i'm willing to take. i've always been a werewolf man myself.

this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda. it started off like a good sci-fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated. i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it. the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god.the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable, writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all, this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided.there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject. if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels , you will love this movie.

this movie starts really good.after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap.some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ - or you go to hell.don't watch it - it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...this movie starts really good.after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap.some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ - or you go to hell.don't watch it - it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...

my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. from the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st. james was in the film, realized it was a christian movie, and suggested we watch it. we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "christian" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.to be fair, there were a few things i liked about the film. the musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. the film begins with an interesting premise - ufo abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture. at least the frank peretti-inspired "the visitation" (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise. "unidentified" ends nowhere even close to where it started, which is a huge letdown.as for the acting? the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (rebecca st. james plays a bit part and is passable.) for their part, a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. sadly, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. the "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying.a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of more interest to christian than non-christian readers. in a word, it is embarrassing. other christian films like carmen's "the champion" and peretti's "the hangman's curse" have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. this film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.i do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and i applaud efforts to create good christian film. unfortunately, this is not one of them. if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film, consider "mercy streets," the aforementioned "the champion," or (if you're pentecostal) robert duvall's provocative "the apostle." as for "unidentified?" rent it if you must, but screen it before you show it to a non-christian or a larger audience.

first of all, i have nothing against christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! what a waste of believers' money. they'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. i don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this "movie", because i couldn't find any of those in this. story's simple - two reporters, one (a) is atheist, the other (b) for some sake has abandoned religion. b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson - believe in christ or go to hell. this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie. people, do not believe the rating of this "movie", read reviews first. i didn't and wasted an hour of my life :( ps: why is it classified as sci-fi? because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky? pps: u.f.o. = satan's evil doings? that's a new one :)

supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense. it's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos, one i've heard before. this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. the paranormal? it's real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a christian context, then of course, it is of god. simple, if it isn't of god, it's the of the devil, stupid! so i suppose since beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by god, it must have been written under demonic influence. or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe, therefore there is none (a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy) and that god created the universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. i think of carl sagan's remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space.so what are ufos? they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event, the rupture...i mean rapture. before the tribulation, the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. all part of satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist.this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.it's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or satan or some such.this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to free rock concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan's ballgame. but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam, the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity, as islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism. although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascal's wager. the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you're wrong?basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy. even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default, nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.for all we know, native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better.this movie should be stamped right on the box: caution: contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.

this movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly acted. all of the characters were two-dimensional. it was a real amateur attempt. the movie was fundamentalist christian propaganda. the christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters. the movie was a real "gotcha" for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie. i remember another movie on a similar subject, "the rapture," starring mimi rogers, that was much better and professionally done. i think i'll watch "the rapture" again. if you attend "unidentified" and don't like it, don't say i haven't warned you.

how awful is it? let me count the ways: 1) it is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for christianity. c'mon! if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? it annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) it's not even a good sales pitch! if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, i'd run like hell in the opposite direction. they're scary! 3) the acting is terrible. they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) the cinematography is home-movie bad. wait, actually its not even that good. 5) script bad, bad, bad. all dialogue, no action. like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between the "talking head" close ups. 6) direction... what direction? oh, there must have been a director there somewhere. i challenge you to figure out where.believe it or not, i have some positive comments about this movie. the editing seemed professional, but couldn't make a difference. a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie. the opening theme music was actually very good! very scary and ufo-ish. too bad the movie wasn't about ufos.if you can't tell already, here's the bottom line. i wasted my money seeing this movie, and it made me angry. if they had not disguised what this movie was really about, i could say it was my fault.

one of the worst films i have ever seen! after watching it i walk out like, what happened? i am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. first,i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! this movie isn't scary at all! there is even no typical horror clichés,too. the plot and acting of this movie was terrible. it's not,fantastic,surrealistic or horror,it's just hideously bad turkish feature film.and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. when i watch 'gomeda' i fell into so hopeless,so sad for young turkish movie maker.please,please don't make 'cinema' like this!

this formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. the plot could have been tightened. high points of the film: seeing "tennessee" ernie ford without a mustache singing "man in the saddle"; alfonso bedoya's too brief scenes as a cook; the color photography of the high country, and the fight scene there with john russell.

by randolph scott standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed star western. two or three of the characters could be dispensed with, while two or three other characters could be given more prominence. (the humour needs to be completely rewritten.) de toth handles the action well - as always - but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak.

over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...actually, it is. it's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman nick gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story. gaglia, who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "patients" with crazy group scare tactics, psychological mind-f*** sessions that could go on for days, and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe, escaped finally when he was 15. i'm glad he got out, though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film-making skills, if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, say, structure, proper lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with actors, and other basics that are perpetually lost here.it's all the more frustrating because gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public (there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cult-rehab). many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas. this is an ever-nagging sensation throughout over the gw, where it almost feels like gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate it properly through his characters. the character that one would think is closest to him, bronx teen tony serra (gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey, would be closest to gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being, where there is very little back-story (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old home) and little connection to his mother (moriarty), who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another. but there is a story to go with his two-year crisis, i guess.right off the bat things get rough (a nude cavity search in the first five minutes), and soon it's clear that instead of medical care it's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect, where the head doctor hiller (insinnia) is a total over-controlling loon. but soon tony's sister sofia (donohue) gets thrown in to the program, and as opposed to tony's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non-compliance, she goes head-on through the whacked-out three step program and once released becoming a runaway. at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare, where there's one woman, a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she's become a prisoner not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them, that do contain some raw power, very brief glimpses of gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama.but these are moments few and far between. it's not just the unsuccessful characters, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical d.a.r.e. rip-offs (maybe some of them, like an angry black youth, the passive-aggressive counselors, or even serra's older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program, would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them). it's that gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $30,000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through. he over-uses tints, mostly with a shade that looks urine-coated), he jiggles his hand-held dvx camera as if it's supposed to be intense ala city of god, occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly, his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there's even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra (inspiration ?) and krakowsky that feel about as false as possible.could gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would-be artistically cathartic plan b? bottom line, no matter how much from-the-heart true life stories may appeal to you, don't bother seeing it in the theater, or even on rental, unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital-hued hudson river sunset with the final words reading: dedicated to the kids. oy.

saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons, i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. this is unfortunately not the case. the set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (the first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv.) once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. that's pretty much it as far as plot development goes. it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make-up fx, fast pace and unpredictability. the sequel, however, doesn't cut it. the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another. if they were annoying or idiots, then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered/demonized/eaten alive...but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered. plus, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of it), they are constantly cutting back and forth between them, which kept pulling me out of the story. there are some amusing bits, courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness. such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor's construction after another as if it were alien acid... the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party, and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child. however, that sequence parlays into a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim. i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene, but i don't think that was bava's intention. the scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman, but hey... other little things like the over-zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters. in summation, i managed to see the unrated version on dvd, and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version, because the make-up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it. also notable is an early role of producer argento's future hottie daughter, asia. in fact, she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen. argento/bava fan's might want to check it out just to see it, but will probably find themselves looking at their watch, like i did. gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx, but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from dead/alive. you could do worse, but it certainly doesn't live up to the original.

the films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style.the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'naked lunch' directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs-esque. otherwise give this film a wide girth. bava and argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.

this film sucks!! it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. good gore, but little plot. sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. i figured that she had pms. it sure seemed that way. the dubbing in this film is horrible. one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. i knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the us. i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film. some good characters, but not many. not worth wasting one's time.

(spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) yeah, it's really weird. i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. but after that, i had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on imdb. i kept confusing it with "night of the demons," but, you know, they're basically the same thing. the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time. even when screaming wasn't really necessary, he'd let out a "listen up now!! block the door with cars!!!!" and so, they'd run cars head on into other cars. but, then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was. the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over... to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us? what was it? why was it there? why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv's in a studio? i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was kinda far away. i mean, he could have just turned the tv off. yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, i hated it. good day...

please, why on earth did bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap?to begin with we, "the viewers" at home are treated to a narration from some unknown ding-bat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankind's triumph over the demons, (yeah right).i can tell you "right now" that this doesn't in anyway what-so-ever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether. bava as usual, makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all. acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set, oh god i'm not going to go on. go see for yourself.as usual you'll be treated to laughable dubbing, crap scenarios that don't make any sense and above all un-answered questions. how typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crap.overall if you're one of those dvd argentophile collector's, then maybe you'll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague, it's no way near the first, so you may wanna avoid like the plague.

when the word "presents" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. for some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. however, i've always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try. for one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2. for another, well, two words: asia argento. (of course, she was eleven when this film was made, and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren: steamy looks and little clothing.) as well, lamberto bava comes from one of italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo (he's the son of mario bava, who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). and the original demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties b-horror films. so how bad can this be, right? well, bad. the demons continue their assault on italian media, as the movie opens in a modern italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background. they're all watching a kind of combination news report/mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film (which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film). through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate, the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anew.yeah. it's that bad. about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths, the cult, gene loves jezebel, etc.) is stunning. it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell, who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackers.makes a half-decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily, but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was. cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp, shivers (aka they came from within), is a whole lot better.

everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. this is simply a "run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.there's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in demons, in demons 2 they're actually a lot worse. you don't care about these characters, at all. the plot is nonexistent, the music poor (apart from one simon boswell song), it's not scary in the least; it's just not that good.easily the worst film dario argento has been involved with and lamberto bava's also (bava has a cameo in this film, not a very funny one).maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least i could watch it all and didn't think of stopping midway. my advice; stick to the original.

typically elaborately crafted hbo production with a first-rate cast, a rich small-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes, graced by above average production values.but, and that's a huge 'but', the various subplots, peopled with some likable, mostly annoying caricatures, are paper-thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours.the often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama, without being entertaining enough, and personal drama, without being profound at all.a shame, because some scenes really shine. two or three, that is.4 out of 10 grubby paul newmans

despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. it's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says "isn't that clever? am i not smart? isn't that biting social commentary?" and,sadly, the answer is always "ummmm...no." wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality. thankfully, it died young. empire falls falls flat.

wow. what can i say? i was born in 1960. i love bad tv movies. love them. i get involved. the works. i want to get involved. i'm spending time watching the thing. i watched the emmys last night on tv. how in the infinite world was the empire falls (excellent name)tv movie up for any awards? it truly had wonderful talent. of course. and they tried admirably. but how can anyone pretend that was an ok (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? ok direction? you know, i wish everyone the best. really. but i thought it was totally mind-bending that hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many honors. awards? for me it was sort of a wake-up call that hollywood is such a small insular community. being cynical is not really my thing. but wow. --xptyngi

put simply, this mini-series was terrible. let me count the ways. 1. absurd plotting. 2. over-acting. 3. scattershot approach to characters. 4. annoying narration. 5. inability to create viewer interest.this film can't even pass the "soap opera for dummies" test. i'm sorry i have not read this award-winning novel, so i am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. you look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. that's like this film, with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out. there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series, yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all.there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you'll find on 10,000 monkeys. the pace is extraordinarily slow. dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over-the-top that their characters are not believable. joanne woodward's character is one-dimensional. the persistent river metaphor becomes trite.and, probably the most absurd part of the film--the cat. this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers--well, come on now---it's not even good stephen king!probably the most interesting character in the film, and one who is not drawn well, is john voss, the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film.just about everyone in this film is unbelievable.to sum up, there's little here to inspire. the drama is poor melodrama. it's just a terrible effort.

i'm relieved the later reviews have turned sour - reading all the positive feedback, i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different than everyone else's in the world. everything in this movie rang false to me...the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the corny narration, all of it. as each scene unfolded i kept thinking, "people don't act like this." it's relentlessly heavy-handed and maudlin. in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it, or pretending to like it, because it's serious and about real people and confronts issues. but man, it really did not work for me.

we found this movie nearly impossible to watch. with such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. the flash-backs were clumsy. the characters were one-dimensional. the heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. the movie nobody's fool, based on another novel by russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. the photography in empire falls was lovely. too bad it wasn't a travelogue.i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself. i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel's reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie. this was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not books on tape.

i know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. the entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. this is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. however, unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish. i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes. i can respect the work that went into it, but it's just not compelling.

not even emeril lagasse cooking can save this disjointed, overheaded idiotic nonsense, starring emeril lagasse as a tv chef from the food channel,who with help of the crew to try to make the show better, poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain, robert urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever(r.i.p.), this is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade.i feel very sorry for emeril lagasse for making this sitcom, he even said himself it stunk.it's hard to believe that they are the same producers of designing women that did this mess.tv review: 1 star

it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful. i wonder what made those people get up with this story. and above all: who cares?the technical stuff didn't satisfy me as well. the sound is poor, so is the editing and the "direction" is absent. the actors are admittedly fine, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job. do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely? see?i gave it 2/10 because after all this thing had something that i can't put in words. b movie charm? camp fun? nudity? i don't know.

i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: i was not impressed, not at all. i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.on the discussion board, i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. it says: "'deed poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. the brilliant acting of barbara kowa and andré schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work (steffen ritter) make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). however, the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains." unfortunately, this is true. i wasn't intrigued by the story at all. the protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. so what? for many times, the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing.what's the point of the movie? what's the message behind it all? the anonymous reviewer said: "somehow biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid-air without a message. thus the boredom i blame on the movie. the movie is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral and it doesn't take long to see the flaws: for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation), the character of the mute brother is not developed very well. some moments are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene) an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long. as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away." again, i must agree. i did like the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni meurer and andré schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (the sex scenes, though, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.)all in all, "deed poll" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea wasted -, but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money. maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.

"electra glide in blue" is a slow moving b-flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. a mediocre film at best, "eg in b" features some members of the band chicago, a whiff of action, some philosophizing, and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler. not worth the time.

i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time. i've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on tv or i've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. well, after watching the dvd, i now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. in fact, i'd say it's pretty much of a mess.electra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows. the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together. more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together. the movie can be boiled down to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; cops going to work; crazy guy tells story; cop finds dead body; cop and chief and girlfriend at bar; chase scene; etc. the scenes just don't flow together. they're very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak, borderline amateurish. the scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene at the farm with the hippies, the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy. i almost stopped the film during those (awful) moments.the film-maker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film. the style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. then it tries to be a buddy film (big john and zipper) then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. a film doesn't have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i'm afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused. you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it.the film is not a complete disaster. while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish, the look of it is extremely (and deceptively) professional. the cinematography is stunning. every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery. or, because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves. and thanks to robert blake's acting (of a really badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, even though nothing else makes much sense. what's remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it's been copied and duplicated a million times over. the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun, which was made 13 years later. scenes of johnny dressing up, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of american gigolo. strangely enough, electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it, due to the stunning visuals, even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated.so, electra glide in blue is, on one hand, a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition. very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit. but, on the other hand, egib is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, confusing story, and muddled direction, none of which are worth of remembering.

first off, i am a huge fan of robert blake, always have been.this movie came on movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me & of course the star. but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started.... there are some good scenes, and i thought they would lead somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be an "anti-cop" "anti-buddy" "anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-everything movie", with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere.robert blake is great as the lead, well as great as someone could be with this bad movie, i am still a huge fan of mr. blake and love his acting even in crap like this...but this drug induced 70's tripe, well... better stay away from this one...and, that ending, what a pisser.

the show is at least partially faked (so is not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episode.proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat, before he gets there, can been seen as his boat approaches.the actors playing "ambulance officers" didn't remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it, which would never happen in reality.they also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the emergency entrance (which does not make any sense, unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there)

i think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of cheaters joey greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by "cheaters spy's" is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s-1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you infowarrior

i'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am i bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. i wouldn't even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged. hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.the premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer. if only this idea were free of all the legal complications/trappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people, and what is eventually aired. hence the only way to create this """reality show""" was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise (and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time!). shouldn't this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school? most reviews i read here don't even mention that any of this is fake, let alone that all of it might be. wishful thinking or just boundless naivety? the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom-of-the-barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables, waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show (or this crap), which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks. i even recognized one actress (in the role of "cheater") that i saw years earlier in "the jerry springer show". and i only saw 6-7 episodes of "cheaters". how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and "cheaters" that i don't even know about?however, to compare "cheaters" with springer isn't fair to the latter. the springer show is not all fake; a bulk of the episodes are unstaged - hence often highly entertaining. there is no value to be found in "cheaters", unless you're a struggling actor and want to get tips on how not to act in front of the camera.the producers use various (very cheap, transparent) tricks to create the illusion of realness, to give their footage that elusive documentary feel. but it's all in vein. in the end, the more intelligent train-wreck-seeking viewer is left with absolutely squat. "professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.

there is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men. one sees it in television adverts and program plots. cheaters is a prime example, they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men, why? the prime threat to any government's power resides in the male population, they're less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat. a way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media. other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big-jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum. in australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges, another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance. cheaters, aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, furthermore most of these women assault the men! if it were round the other way the men would be in jail!! if it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters, because they don't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat. men's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway.

too bad this movie isn't. while "nemesis game" is mildly entertaining, i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie, especially the situations that sara was putting herself into. are we supposed to believe that:1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun, but don't put the whole "i never sinned" riddle together until the very end...and then...and then...get this...she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together?? i know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think we're that stupid?3) when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde, there is not one topless chick in the whole building. nada. c'mon. i know it's canada, but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweed.and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that riddlezone site, that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow, and didn't turn into a little hand (like all cursors do when you click on a hyperlink)?!? i mean, if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie, at least get the little things right. geez.

i absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! i once caught part 5 on vhs 10 years ago, and i was disappointed. but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, i have to say it was no way better than number 5. my expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's pg-13. the acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects. but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore (the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight, but come on..)surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 were directed by sequel-director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface: texas chainsaw massacre iii. i liked puppet master: the legacy, even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies.overall, puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series: a great trilogy but forget the rest..

being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city, ignoring the rest of the country. while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time, i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan! the men interviewed here are the same "a-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s, and here they are again, waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude. the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics, such as race, ageism, the burgeoning gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image, and the rise of the "clones", discrimination of sub-groups within the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). alas, we have none of this presented, and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories. if you were there in that decade, you'll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home-movies of the bars and discos we haunted. if you weren't there, this film will undoubtedly seem dull. it should have been so much more, but sadly, it's not. two stars for jogging my memory...i still miss going to the anvil!

this movie should be retitled: sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea.this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city. i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film.don't get me wrong, the time period looks like a blast. and it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers. but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. technically it's no oscar nominee, but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject.overall, an "eh."

i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. it is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. it's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. with only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. it's more like a "how to" guide for something that can't be done anymore. i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.

formulaic to the max. neither title reflects the serial's actual content, "fighting nazis in morocco," (actually, the iverson ranch). the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. the packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. that's at least three a chapter! aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. when the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too. so, kudos to the fight choreographer, who is the real star of this serial! two positive notes: the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights, and best of all, we have the girl side kick (often a journalist, as she is here) actually participating in the mayhem, mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys. yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in "manhunt of mystery island" (1945). on the negative side, there are just too many jump out of the way escapes-- before the slab falls, before the car goes over the cliff, before the speedboat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you, etc. etc.it is claimed that this serial partially 'inspired' george lucas to make the first indiana jones film, but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development.rod cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he played in all his films. other than watching all the furniture getting smashed, there's nothing really going on here, compared to other serials that have fewer fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters.i give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing.

i have to differ from the other comments posted. amid sporadic funny moments, there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny. the strain shows. i watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation- none of us were thrilled.

is the cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, "falscher bekenner" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum american re-title ("low profile").building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests. it starts out with a grabber, as a haunting shot of a desolate off-the-highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter, who ultimately walks by a totaled car, where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead in a gory mess. stunned, he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine.just out of school, the drifter turns out to be armin steebe, a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition. persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job, he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it, every one with the same fruitless outcome. getting mighty sick of it, his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion: claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit.pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise, he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown. as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter, as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary.if you seem confused about what exactly is going on, don't worry about being the only one: this is about as far and coherent as the story gets. the plot seems simple enough, and perhaps due to it's seemingly direct purposes that's why "falscher bekenner" becomes pointlessly convoluted, becoming enamored with endless false conclusions, dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument (supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland, or something about youth's fascination with crime. hey, it could even be a coming-out movie.) at hand. it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and surrealistically allegorical, but they don't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest. the most fatal flaw, however, is how the filmmakers paint all it's characters in a rough shade of vanilla. there's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal- perhaps too normal- family) catalyze the already under-developed lead character's "plight" never comes into focus. how are we supposed to identify with this young almost-adult's rebellion, with little sense of the world he's living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it? many people drop in and out of the movie (including armin's sort-of girlfriend katja, and a strange, affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies) and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever. they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next.and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality (especially with armin's nightly exploits), it ends with a literal, almost moralizing head-scratcher that seems to halt questions to a "story" that does little but put it's viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion.without any color, it's impossible to shade anything vital in.

this movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie really sucks! it is disguised as a "thinker's film" in the likes of memento and other jewels like that, but at the end, and even after a few minutes, you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. the whole idea is  i don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one, btw) with stupid "riddles", the kind you learn on elementary school recess, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! what? how, what, why, why? is just like saying that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients, and add water forgot about cooking it? i guess these guys forgot to, not explain, but present the mechanism of why was this happening? you have to do that when you present a story which normal, everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. acting was horrible, with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera, and the guy from highlanders, the series, acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah, they're all real though s-o-b's). the "menacing" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-clever" riddles (enter the 60's series of batman and robin, with guest appearance of the riddle) and the crazies who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smirk on their faces just horrible, horrible.i'm usually very partial about low budget movies, and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve, in lieu of their constrictions, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it.

well i'd probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly i thought it was such a piece of crap i mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was all terrible. although the special effects wasn't a bit bad but i think the should have thought a lot harder than that. i mean how did clara bryant get successfully put into this film i mean she'd do a lot better if she looked a bit further and that goes the same with kristen honey, i mean her character dies and she doesn't bother to try and defend herself i mean it's gotta be a total joke. she should at least do a lot better than what she an do like become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery. but the point is the actors did a complete soulless lousy job and so did the director and the writer who made this film. they should've went into film school to think up some better ideas and i hope everyone agrees with my methods cos they are probably thinking the same thing.

i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought, despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time. as soon as i got home i raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed. while it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. the characters are changed (ie finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or altogether changed (ie. lepper), many characters are missing and famous lines/thought are missing. the movie does attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat boring movie. it is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this movie takes those things and utterly destroys them in its rewriting.

first i must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book. so of course, i have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. but as i began to watch this film, i was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. the original version from the early 1970s, though shot at phillips exeter academy where the book's author attended school, and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters. the original seemed to simply go through the motions. reading the trivia about the movie, you discover that it was cast mostly with non-actors. thus, the original has an amateurish feel to it and it ultimately fails.this new version, though i will grant that it captures the look of the period better than the original, seems to have thrown the book out all together. scenes are rearranged, characters imposed where they don't belong, characters created that were not in the book, and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. and the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital, almost central character it is in the book. this is an inexcusable oversight on the part of the film makers. how could they downplay the role of the tree? why was it not introduced immediately? why the dead poet-esque beginning? and what in god's name was up with gene's accent? this film is, to be blunt, garbage. a separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or screen. john knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine, linear style. the film makers should have trusted the story as it was already written; make changes, sure; embellish here and there, sure; take some mild dramatic license, sure. but destroy one of the pearls of american literature in the process? what were they thinking? in their corruption of the story line, they cut any possibility of suspense or drama. the whole movie falls flat and fails miserably.if you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking of skimping and just watching the movie...don't even think about it. this film will be of no help to you.alas, we shall have to wait even longer before a version of this story comes to the screen that truly does it justice.

sheltered young woman, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted, harbors a disturbed, overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. directed by celebrated cinematographer william a. fraker, this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in: each shot is composed for the utmost style, but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping narrative. fraker (and his cinematographer, lászló kovács) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnished, tableaux feel. the mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor, and fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral. robert shaw and sally kellerman (as shaw's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing (which turns their scenes into little bits of half-realized business). sondra locke, another interesting screen personality, seems cast for her resemblance to catherine deneuve in "repulsion". pale and saucer-eyed, with imposingly thick and long hair, locke is a curious human puzzle, and she's initially quite intimidating and dangerous; however, this role is so old-hat that locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze, and she flounders. fraker allows locke's freak-out scenes to go on and on, while shaw (looking terrifically debonair) is put in the impossible position of playing touchy-feely daddy to her. all of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility (or, at the very least, some dry wit or humorous relief). as it is, lewis john carlino and edward hume's limp script, adapted from stanton forbes' novel "go to thy deathbed", strands the viewer early on, and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line. *1/2 from ****

lame rip-off of the quatermass xperiment (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. in the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in criterion's "monsters & madmen" set), director day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!)...and i'd have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had i not recently watched caltiki, the immortal monster (1959) - a similar (and similarly threadbare) but far more stylish venture from italy! bill edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively boring at first, but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o.k. as a leaner glenn ford type; he had previously starred in fiend without a face (1958), another (and more successful) richard gordon-produced sci-fi which, incidentally, is also available on dvd through criterion. italian starlet marla landi, struggling with the english language, makes for an inadequate female lead; even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value! the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver/richard gordon track where, among many things, the fact that first man into space was intended as a double-feature with corridors of blood (1958) is brought up - but it was eventually put out as a standalone release, so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race; it's also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by bonar colleano (who, tragically, died in a traffic accident prior to the film's release!). weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd featurette shot by, of all people, ex-cult-ish film-maker norman j. warren: landi, who by then had become a lady of title, was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs!; edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but, once in london, he proved reluctant to co-operate with weaver - eventually, the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, he died in 2002!

rivalry between brothers leads to main story line. navy commander chuck prescott(marshall thompson)has developed the y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere. his brother, lt. dan prescott(bill edwards), seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the y12. dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil. on dan's second flight, he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm. returning to earth, dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of bad asphalt. he also has a demanding craving for blood, whether it be from farm animals or fellow human beings.short runtime of an hour and seventeen minutes; black & white with near stoic acting...typical of low budget sci-fi.rounding out the cast is marla landi, robert ayers and carl jaffe. noteworthy trivia: about two months after this film was released; the russians put the real first man in space.

okay, when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people! well, it was almost everything what i expected, typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. acting has to be the worst i've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off. so why 'night fright' doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good'? reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring. for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose. and then the grand finale, the people's waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get wack'd in 20 second, end of film.yeah, 'night fright' is boring, but it got couple of funny moments. i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like 'zontar, the thing from venus' or 'curse of the swamp creature'.i give 'night fright' 4 space monkey slaps out of 10..-rob gruesome-

"a texas community is beset with a rash of mysterious killings involving some of the students from the local college. the sheriff investigating the death discovers the startling identity of the killer responsible for the murders. a nasa experiment involving cosmic rays has mutated an ape and turned it into an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for blood," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.or, could the creature really be a mutated alligator returning from a space-bound "noah's ark"? a long opening, with laughably straight 1960s couple ralph baker jr. (as chris) and dorothy davis (as judy), suggests "night fright" might be a joyously bad movie; but, don't get your hopes up. after some innocent cavorting, the attractive collegiates discover another couple has encountered a monster; naturally, the creature is hell-bent on terrorizing young romantics. sheriff john agar (as clint crawford) isn't trusted by the younger set; but, he really wants to help.mr. agar was a friend of my aunt; he spoke about very few movies, and this wasn't one of them.

when a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small texas town, people start to die. the county sheriff tries to investigate but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials. it turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woods.i like low budget science fiction and horror movies. i like monster movies. so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie. sadly, i didn't.i don't mind the bad acting, the corny dialog, the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has. there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad it's good kind of way.but where others of that type and night fright differ is that night fright just has terrible pacing. and it drags on because of that. there are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening-the searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time; there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods...but nothing interesting is going on. if these scenes were shorter, the movie might not have been as boring (though i don't think simply cutting those scenes would save this one).i have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that i gave it a chance before slamming it in this review. sadly, it has gotten worse with each watch. there won't be a fourth.

this cheap and rubbish film is about a nasa test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals. it vanishes for a while then unexpectedly returns, crash landing in a forest, unleashing a vicious mutant creature.like many films of this type, night fright, features dumb teenagers boogieing on down to 60's surf music before being killed. none of the murders, however, are even remotely memorable, as we don't really see anything. one thing we do see, however, is that one of the teenagers appears to be about 40 years old and sports a quite impressively silly haircut.for a creature feature to work, it really has to present its monster to the viewer properly. in this film, however, we only get the briefest glimpses of the monster. it seems to sort of resemble the alien from robot monster. but i'm not sure; as the photography was so dark i simply couldn't make out what the hell was going on a lot of the time. although, my gut feeling was that i probably wasn't missing very much.

this movie was painfully awful. most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods, walking thru the woods, or dancing in the woods. more than half, at least. then two kids who discover two 'horribly mutilated bodies' in the woods, return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk. ????? there is no time continuity. its day, its night, its day, its really really night, its dusk, its pitch black, its day. all the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind. really bad. the sheriff discovers a five foot claw print embedded in the dirt of the woods and theorizes that a super large alligator may have learned to walk upright. really a silly movie with no real motivation written in for the characters. might be entertaining for young kids, as an alternative to really graphic stuff.

what? - that was it? the town sheriff (john agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? did i just write that? did i just see that? with instrumentals by the wildcats, "night fright" is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. the heyday of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than ray corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble. remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4.0 rating on the imdb. but sadly, this one never should have stood a chance of seeing the light of day. oops, there's another quirk - you can never tell if it's day or night in the story, since they seem interchangeable with one another.i'll give you this though, a couple of the early malt shop scenes looked like they could have gone on the air as coke commercials. thinking about it now, those were probably the best looking and best lit scenes of the picture; coca cola must have paid for them. had they seen the completed movie, they might have been better served to prevent it's release.

okay it is terribly, and i mean terribly, easy to pick apart this film. c'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis, and actors in leads such as carol gilley, ralph baker jr., dorothy davis, bill thurman, and, my personal favourite, roger ready. yes, b star john agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the texan landscape of a robot-like ape from a nasa experiment gone awry. the movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting. i really cannot find much good to say about it other than as bad films go you could do a lot worse as far as finding something dreadful to sit through. it is bearably short and has many moments of unintended humor. missed cues, lighting faux pas, off-screen terror, an unbelievably inane score, and of course john agar trying his level best to be the core of the film with an earnest performance amidst this muck. the beginning is the hardest part to sit through as it seems like it takes forever for these two teens to get their comeuppance for traveling in the woods down the texas back roads where great ape soon will reek his vengeance in his own terrible way...yeah right! night fright! bah!

i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. so, because of this it's natural that i'd choose this film--especially because with john agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. at least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting. here, you never really see that much of the monster (mostly due to the darkness of the print) and the acting, while bad, is more low energy bad...listless and dull.the film begins with some young adults going to satan's hollow to neck. well, considering the name of the place, it's not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces! duh...don't go necking at satan's hollow!! well, there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky, so what do the teens go? yep, throw a dance party--a very, very, very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion. so it's up to the sheriff (agar) and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication.as for the monster, it's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask--a bit like the monster in robot monster. not exactly original and not exactly high tech. to make it worse, it makes snorting noises and moves very, very slowly--so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it! how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me.overall, too dull to like--even if you are a fan of lousy cinema.

this one isn't even lively enough to be fun. something is out there, ripping people off (off-screen) after a spaceship crash (off-screen) while government executives investigates (off-screen) and bad actors says stupid lines (on-screen), including a guy who looks like jim carrey with a hangover. the "monster", when it finally is shown, looks like an extra from "robot monster", but there ain't enough monster fu anyway.fortunately, it's pretty short. skip it, unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this

there is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. the government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature's victims. you gotta be extremely unparticular about how you spend your time - or rich, if you spend any money - to view this epic.

imagine what it must have been like for john agar. one of hollywood's handsome leading men. married to shirley temple for five years. he finds himself doing movies like this. i remember him in "tarantula" where he wasn't half bad. unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. the monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. the police are boring. the teenagers are boring. the plot is stupid. people run around. there are events that do nothing to advance the plot. there's dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack. there is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about. it isn't even campy or outrageous. it's just no worth anything. agar might as well have been a post. he's given nothing to do.

mixing small town sheriffs, high-school students, fake rock music, and some weirdo who kills for, well, no reason in particular, this film is essentially a re-make of "the giant gila monster" - except without the gila monster, of course.now, anyone who has actually seen "giant gila monster", knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time, frequently so slow, it's not even funny. and i can't believe that by 1967, "giant gila monster" had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel, let alone a remake. so will someone please explain to me why this film was made?! the dance sequence, by the way, is historically interesting, although about three years out of date; but even that's spoiled, since it goes on... and on... and... on....

when the budget doesn't allow for a cadillac or packard or lincoln or imperial hearse we are talking cheep cheep. that's bird language for cheap cheap.what is in the hair of the forty year old teen boy? the guy who looks like a cement head who tries a couple of times to run over john agar and provides the only scare in the movie by how close he comes. his hair looks like a shoe. a patent leather shoe. he is a shoe head.the nurse woman needs immediate emergency hair washing. she has lacquer in her blond locks that would ignite if the production company had been able to afford lights.the monster? the music was scarier. i would try to run from the music. the monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast. put some lipstick on that monster and you've got divine's older sister.the camera work and editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout.hello mr. agar? we're thinking of doing a sequel to night fright and... mr. agar? agar? tom willett

i am giving this movie vampire assassins a "2" rating mainly because it had no sex or nudity. other than that, i am not sure why it was ever made. it was more like a training exercise in how to make a movie with a very limited budget. the characters derek and slovak were the best actors. they were followed closely by the "biker-dude" with the pleather pants and silver belt. he was ok too. most of the movie was filmed in some kind of distribution warehouse. if you got tired of watching the kung-fu kick boxing stunts, you can check out the packages of scott tissue, windex and other cleaning products. you will have a lot of time to do this, trust me. i almost started to make a list. the dialogue and kung-fu stunts were extremely slow. they talked slow, fought slow, etc. i don't know why. at least with the extra-slow delivery of the actors lines, you could hear everything very distinctly. i am trying hard to find good stuff to say about this movie. we watched it all the way to the end to see if got any better, but it didn't. we never could decide if the actors really knew martial arts or were just acting like they knew martial arts. you can watch yourself and decide. my favorite line was something like (vampire speaking:) "what are you looking at?" other man responding: "your bad dental work."

i watched this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent, otherwise there is no way i'd have watched it all the way through. the first scene wherein a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seemingly get electrocuted by various slow moving weapons wielded by an even slower moving van helsing wannabe... in black and white... with a voice over, sets the pace for the entire rest of the film. the fight scenes look ridiculous, the dialouge would be funny if the acting wasn't so bad, what passes for plot doesn't make sense, and the production values bite (from the pleather knock off of spike's coat worn by the hero to the cheesy cheap magician's cape their lead vamp swooshes around).i've seen some bad movies (check out the magic sword with b. rathbone, or the raven with a very young jack n.), but this one gets my vote for worst of all times.

incredibly, "vampire assassin" is significantly worse than such atrocities as "tequila body shots" and "zombie nation" - and those movies are terrible. writer/director/star ron hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography i have ever seen in a movie. rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes. this is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved. obviously, aficionados of terrible film-making will want to see this, but it's very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad-movie viewer you are. the fact that ron hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding. if you are a movie director, and you actually think it's ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears, left over from your rough edit - and you apparently can't muster the energy to edit those frames out - then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting. i am astounded that lions gate/maple agreed to release this movie on dvd. in spite of rudy ray moore's very brief cameo, this movie is a work of supreme self-indulgence on ron hall's part - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor, and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills - but the movie is so unbelievably inept that it's hard to believe he'd actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like i'm doing right now. a jaw-dropping, insanely terrible movie. i'm not kidding.

the forgotten (aka: don't look in the basement) is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie.the story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about.the patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!).now the gore is very poor looking, with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list!.overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch.

this one is a poor attempt at spinning the old "cons turn good" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. it actually reminded me of the american series 'the players', although nowhere near as good. omar epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in terminator 4.the mod squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy. at times it takes itself serious but other times it tries to be humorous but fails miserably. the film has a kind of half-finished feel about - as if it was stretched to the 90 minute mark.you'l be disappointed.

this is one of the most boring films i've ever seen. the three main cast members just didn't seem to click well. giovanni ribisi's character was quite annoying. for some reason, he seems to like repeating what he says. if he was the "rain man", it would've been fine, but he's not.3 out of 10.

well the name in the summary should tell you everything. fred olen ray - the modern king of low budget flicks, be it for tv or direct to video (i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of drive-in b-movie double features and all).creator of such cult(?) classics, like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur island....well i kind of like this guys stuff. its mostly entertaining (in a distinctly cheesy, campy and especially cheap kind of way) and if he's one thing, he's a pro - something you can't say for all guys in the movie biz.but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his oevre. insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes. if you are out for real f.o.r. goodness (or rather badness), look out for the above mentioned ones, and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (i think he lost a bit of his edge lately).

this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. and that comment comes from the writer's cousin. this movie was so flipping bad, it made "hulk" (the second worst movie ever) look like "the departed" (one of the greatest movies in cinematic history). if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie. if you have a brain, then you definitely will not. when i rented this movie, i actually fell asleep while watching it. the next day, i finished it from where i left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.

when i borrowed this movie, i wasn't expecting a high-quality performance, but this was just sad.most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. there's nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like "oh no! my dad is invisible!" or "i wonder what this does?" in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with. there are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts.the story is decent, though it would be fairly easy to guess, considering that there aren't too many real plot changes. lots of holes, too. for example, the dad is invisible, and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again. so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store. couldn't he just ask his dad for the cash?this shows up in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb, like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting, or walking around with his head covered at all times. funny at first, but it gets old.2/5, because it is watchable, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way... like the monotone recitation of lines.

okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. however, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. for example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. so, does he ask his father for the dough? nope, he steals it and gets caught. kids, if i'm ever turned invisible, i'll advance your allowance, ok? also, while this kid is at the police station (no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting), his beautiful blond teacher comes in, announces who she is and where she works, then busts the child out of the slam in front of the cops! to make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement. you know, i hate to pick, but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough. y'all avoid it!

i received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know i'm a big fan of low budget horror flicks. kaufman studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. i loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until i saw bugged...what happened?this movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. ronald k. armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. after reading the credits we discover he gave himself the most important role in the film!?! two words mr. director "acting lessons" ok? mr. armstrong joins the ranks of other writer/directors who cast themselves in their own movies and that's mistake number two. the only thing that i believed saved this film was the artistic camera work and the musical score, (let's hear it for the crew!) the cast of other actors who in the beginning of this production seemed a bit cold, really warmed up toward the middle and end of this production. everyone pulled together and helped to pull this film off. ronald armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a decent director or actor but, i'll say this of him-he seems to know how to organize people to get them all to come together and pull his productions off.this film, i have to say can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie because if mr. armstrong was able to pull this off, any one else can too. if you get a chance to see this film, watch it for the sake of getting inspired to do "better" in the future. hollywood needs bigger and better horror flicks to keep this genre coming back from it's grave.

big spoiler right here: this film is b!a!d! but enjoy, it's good bad.bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that uncle ned's carlsbad cavern home video looks like an imax experience. since it's a troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. the brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, "%@#$! what was that?" which is second only to the oft screamed, "now what?"any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to ronald armstrong, the writer/director. when one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper/termite/chiapet thing, armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute, but dumb-as-a-doorknob, "divine." while she's being hit on, divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat-poison/oatmeal mixture on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling over dead from the fumes!the killer bugs are as frightening as piñatas, which they too closely resemble. the effects used to move them include dragging them across tile floors real fast with their legs dragging behind.the highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up, but they were either out of cash or never had any, so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames, they simply let the screen go black (eat you heart out ilm).the cast is virtually all black. how can the naacp consistently censor something truly funny like amos and andy (which depicts characters certainly no less similiar than those on 99% of all white comedy shows), but says nary a peep about something like bugged. oh well, it's best they don't know about how demeaning this film is to all involved (as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group, frankly). before they put the kabosh on bugged, get some friends together and get ready for the plan 9 of bug exterminator movies.

in what attempts to be a positive story, dolph lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for...bird droppings. actually, the nitrogen gas that exudes from the muck on this island is what they are after.there was only one good thing about this movie -- the island location in which it was filmed was beautiful. otherwise, the story drowns itself leaving the actors with nothing to work with. result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, lots of blood, and a few shots of women topless. if you want pointless violence (sorry, the storyline can't even give the violence a point, though it tries) then this is the movie for you.parents: be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood, driving the r rating.

about the movie itself, there are ample comments. i just wanted to say something about the german version, which i have seen recently on tv. it is heavily cut. from 103 to 76 minutes! it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv. i understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. they did not only cut "gore-shots" - they have cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. like: "we have to attack them" - one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp - protagonist running away.when the assault on the island begins, it isn't even possible anymore to follow the storyline. all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic, disconnected scenes that don't make any sense anymore.i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense.i think i would have given the original 7/10 the german version is worth only 1/10get it on dvd (and check the runtime first) or forget about it.

i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night. well, there's not one ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. the score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl," the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes. the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music. this joey de francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is helping with movie scores). is it possible to not only get my four dollars back, but have my therapy sessions paid for as well? this movie, interestingly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once. just get the ear plugs ready!

the characterization in this movie is among the worst i've ever encountered. the dialogue is trite and cliché to the point of extreme distraction. none of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. also, the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--i find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. etc.the smile train is a great organization and it's a nice idea, to make a heartstring-tugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids' lives, but overall, i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything.

the story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered "valley girl" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives. what a great and worthy story line. but in this telling the screen writing and/or directing and/or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story. linda hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet, and for what purpose? conflict, conflict, conflict, at the drop of a hat. katie (the california girl) and her boyfriend, katie's mom and everybody, including the poor lady at the airport check-in counter, lin's adopted father, who is the nicest, most considerate man alive, and his wife and biological son, all in constant conflict. i really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story, but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fighting were over. there were too many unexplained or illogical events, many of which don't add to the story. my wife and i kept looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story, could be crapped up so badly.

...without anything to walk away with. this movie starts with scenes in china with the finding of a newborn. while this is not a new concept, i wasn't going to give up right there. then there is a flash forward to adolescence. the man's wife and biological child are fed up with the father who has neglected them. while this did not seem culturally accurate, and the movie made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted father's devotion, i pressed on.next, we're in malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low-budget (fill in the blank: acting/camera work/lighting).i won't give away any more of the plot, because i suppose the synopsis is accurate: the movie is meant to show how a malibu girl who (though she seems to innately have the compassion and interest to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to china) is spoiled and inconsiderate, finds herself as being a healer and helper of both body and spirit.lame. lame, lame, lame.now i, admittedly, am a harsh critic, so maybe take one of those lame's away and you'll be on the mark.

two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist. however, the script, the direction, and some scenes, were just awful. i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie, but knew the movie was filled with flaws.this film could have been so much better, and reached a larger audience accordingly. what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film, some scenes being painfully bad to watch, i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself.

the pace of this movie is quite slow. it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. nothing surprises you. i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:katie - a beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. she realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world". touching.the mother - high strung, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) that need taking care of by a strong man.the father - patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman.the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants.the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn't know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock. thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties.the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother i.e. a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything.the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl. because in china (a third world country according to the film) don't have anything and hence needs our charity. gah, wake up and smell what you are shoveling.sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries (read usa) is so shallow and happy ending-ish that it is sad and revolting. shanghai (where the movie is set) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment.the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ...the teacher (sean astin) that has this really heart ripping story (not) that he tells without feel. why sean? why!?etc etc. it is difficult to actually finding a "real" person in the entire movie.this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15. if you want to learn anything about the world watch e.g. hotel rwanda instead. for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian "cinema paradiso" that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back.the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some (not all) of the beautiful chinese country side. i have been there and seen some of it.

i do not like himesh reshamiya. i do not like his singing too. but his songs are a craze in india, especially among commoners. now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke! what guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. i did never want to see this movie. but one thing changed it. the movie becoming a super-duper hit! after 2 weeks, aap ka saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. if i can sit through apne and rajnikant's absurd sivaji  i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit? the story is about the real life singer himesh reshamiya (hr) who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with riya (hansika motwani). a german lawyer ruby (mallika sherawat) loves himesh. now himesh is arrested for a murder. the mission of himesh (in last 40 minutes) after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer.let me say that himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. he tries hard but fails miserably. he is pathetic. i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much? let me find something positive.first, the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point himesh runs away from the jail. (but after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits) second, the songs of the movie are good, catchy, crowd puller numbers. third, mallika sherawat  she looks gorgeous and acts well too, as the second lady. i can imagine fans of mallika coming to see the movie just for her. fourth, the cinematography of the movie is pleasing  especially the german locales, are a treat to watch for the eye. fifth, the major portion of the story is a love story between himesh and riya  with clichéd dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd. sixth, the director prashant chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of himesh as much as possible with shots that don't need himesh to act much.the heroine hansika motwani looks like a small budget film heroine. raj babbar is wasted in a small role. overall the movie is a below average.i was thinking throughout the movie  what if the same movie script was done with salmaan as the main lead. i think it would have had been a much better affair. may be then i would have given the movie 6 out of 10. but now (stars 4.5 out of 10)

this movie has to be the worst film of 2007, it was just really bad and i don't think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad, i mean the don't make really bad hollywood films do they?? hamish really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just can't act at all, god he was just so bad, i mean he was that bad in the film that he made mallika sherawat look like a better actress than him, as for her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it is just so boring watching her, i mean what do men see in this woman?, yeah she has a god body but where is that talent???? i have not seen it yet and at this rate i don't think that i ever will.anyway hamish falls in love with ria now this 15 year old girl can act, my god she was the best actor in the film and she does not look 15 at all, to me she looks about 21, but her performance was brilliant in the film. bless her she was really good, i hope to see more of her in the future. so ria falls in love with himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical bollywood film anyways there is a hiccup (can only happen in a bollywood film) and the both get married in the end.well i would give th music 10/10 it was superb, that made the movie a hit, the songs were truly amazing and brilliant. anyways the only thing that i can say is to go and buy the music and not watch the film.

( hr is what himesh is called in the movie, i think he likes it too. ) it's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.i really like reshamiya. it's amazing what he has done. no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.and i truly expected a great film ( what with the budget of 50 cr and the cute actress ). as intense as reshamiya is i thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. ironically he is depicted the same but for what care? sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain.blunders rule. ( ex. how can german police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in english? they communicate among themselves in english!) unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood. there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too. the worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care.songs are the only saving grace...please don't repeat this hr and find yourself a good director ( low budget.. no problem).the villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know... after all it's a 50cr movie.

as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: in was in mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, i was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.while i speak german as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english, otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience... so therefore, all germans in this movie actually speak english! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-indian characters are only done by 4 voices! . . . .

well, some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass. if that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, file your teeth to points and think that the name lilith silver is cool, you'll see a fine film.if, like most people, an assassin dressed in gleaming, creaking rubber with huge cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. i laughed so hard i nearly cried. ridiculous acting, dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula, dead and loving it could be...it tries to be cool and goth, and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious. even the tacked-on lesbian scene is funny (how *did* she get those boots off that quickly? they were laced up to *here*...)don't see it if you like good films. see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over.... it isn't good, it's just bad.

i laughed at the movie! the script, the acting please don't we deserve better? but now the filming, some of the camera angles were interesting. i did enjoy the film, but it's not to be taken seriously though. i liked it. if it had a new cast and scriptwritter it would be better than all right. it's worth a look!

12 grand is the cost of a new car. a new car that jake west now needs to escape the hordes of angry villagers desperate for his blood. some may say this film could attract "so bad it's good" status. in my opinion it is the proud owner of the "so bad it's bad" label.

i had no expectations when seeing the movie because i was seeing it with a bunch of friends and had no idea what it was. some parts were silly and some parts were lame, but overall the movie was worth watching. i like goth looking women; this movie has plenty of it. the fangs do look really lame though.

the animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. after having watched mondo cane and mondo magic, these scenes are average. the grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. but they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. i always like hearing the silly voice-overs. they never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. i liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too. the youngest princess looked really young, almost 14 or something. the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes, so that was good.3/10.

if, like me, you actively seek out the rarest and weirdest (and often most awful) that world cinema has to offer, then you should look no further than the supernatural horror output of hong kong in the early 80s. often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy, and usually packed with plenty of creepy crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes etc.), these movies are about as bizarre as it gets.succubare is definitely a case in point: featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from straying by casting nasty spells over them (that, should they leave, cause them to fill up with writhing creatures and die an agonising death), some so-so martial arts, and lots of real life animal killing (much of which is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story), this film is just plain strange.a prolonged scene in which the tribeswomen hunt for snakes and insects, casually throwing the creatures into the baskets on their backs, is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox bashed on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting; and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited onto the floor will have the squeamish losing their appetite for a while.however, it's the live animal munching that really qualifies succubare for legendary status amongst fans of out-there movie-making. it's thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling: the geek chomps on a snake, woofs down a fat, juicy toad (nasty!), and hungrily devours a mouse (biting off its head and then shoving the rest in afterwards).not a great movie (hell, it's not really even a mediocre movie), succubare is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all. this one gets 4 out of 10 from me, which is probably more than it deserves, but i begrudgingly respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill.

i have never ever seen such a bad movie before. the scene where they shoot some guy.. the pistol don`t even shoot. damn that is baad. the scene with the boy is even not that good. no script, not any good sound, not anything good to say about this movie..

given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved, livin' tha life could have been worse. jamal wants to be chris tucker (whom i've always found very annoying), as a previous commentator has noted, but peanut (edward d. smith), while some of his (over)reactions go on way too long (a director's problem), has some comparatively subtle and funny moments, such as when he is trying to instruct jamal on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy. throughout, he is usually more poised and self-possessed than jamal, which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasn't developed very far.but the inexperience of the writer/director/cinematographer/etc. is no excuse for his inattention. has he ever seen a movie? faces are important! has he ever heard of a closeup? even ed wood could do a closeup. i don't think it's much of a budget issue. i could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like, and not just because of no closeups, but the lighting ...! lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! that would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot, helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time. if that's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow, or you can expose for the shadows, and if it hadn't been shot in l.a. i'd say take advantage of cloudy days. it goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all, with the possible exception of weekend at bernie's, better than this one, but livin' tha life would have left a much better impression if it hadn't made the viewer squint all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have been.p.s. the scene in the barbershop is just stupid.

my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of bad improv but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long & drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short & efficient. what happened in this film was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they didn't know when to stop, they just kept going for ages on stupid topics. at first i thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long, useless scenes to flesh it out. as the movie progressed, i realized it was just a really bad movie.there were a lot of parts where i could see that the film maker had a really good idea for a shot but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it off effectively. a lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot (cause, you know, improv) for what felt like a really long time. so boring! if you can stand to put up with and hour and a half of terrible improv, watch it. it's really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying. the acting ranges from alright to absolutely terrible. it seemed like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the ballsy kid who swore lots, the barbershop, etc etc.but yeah. painfully bad. like, i was literally hurting. after an hour or so, my friends and i just got bored and left.

never before have i seen such a tale of such talentless hangers on been so ungrateful that their golden goose has failed to lay. these spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. i felt sorry for troy as he tried to hook up all of his friends with hollywood gigs, but as soon as things turned sour, they all left troy hanging. overnight was a contrived effort of self indulgent retribution on a man who was going up against the forces of hollywood to retain story integrity. the simple premise of overnight is to try an communicate the message, "look at this guy, he blew it all", when in fact he has a strong underground following, dealt with harsh blows from friends and executives all in the name of getting a project done in the way he envisioned it. quite frankly the only productive par that any of these guys played in the overall execution of the boondock saints shoot culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar room scene, after that all they did was whine why they weren't a bigger deal based on the clambering of their rancid efforts on top of troys shoulders. (the 2nd half of this was written by adam j farina)

i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind boondock saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies i've ever seen. but the makers of "overnight" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr. duffy look like a putz. but it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's boondock saints even about? how hard is it to meet patrick swayze? what are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught? because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in any coherent way, it doesn't end up having dippity-doo to say about hollywood either. so who cares?

odious chuck norris decided to put one final nail in the coffincontaining his film career before going to the safe world of cbssaturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernaturalactioner.for such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty. norris is chicagocop frank shatter. first off, what kind of last name is "shatter"?have you ever met any shatters? genforum.com has no listing forthe last name shatter, which opens up any half clever viewer toreplace the "a" in shatter with an "i." he and his partner, calvinjackson, do the same old buddy cop routine you have seenbefore: make funny with the pimps, and make their captain mad.jackson, looking like the theoretical love child of whoopi goldbergand rick james, quickly wears on the nerves with his constantcomplaining and eddie murphy-patented facial expressions.shatter and calvin become involved with an emissary of satan,whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes.prosatano is a demon who is locked in a crypt by king richard thelionhearted. the demon's scepter, from which he gets his power,is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of theworld by holy men. in 1951, some grave robbers accidentally letprosatano out and he begins collecting the nine pieces. hedisguises himself as an antiquities professor named lockley andalways happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killedand a piece of the scepter is taken.norris brings in his "walker: texas blunder" cohort sheree wilson,who plays lockley's assistant. she helps norris with hisinvestigation, they make goo goo eyes at each other, and ourintrepid investigators travel to israel after a rabbi is killed inchicago. while in israel, calvin is given even more to complainabout: the heat, the lack of restaurant accomodations, the lousydrivers, and the fact that he is missing the chicago bulls playoffgames. norris even manages to work a cute israeli kid into thisnightmare. bezi steals calvin's wallet, and hangs around the men,leading them around israel and not arousing any sort ofappropriate suspicion.eventually, lockley (prosatano) assembles all of the scepterpieces, but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremonyand call up the devil. where to find royal blood? well, sheree'sfather is a duke! she has an american accent but she is thescreenwriters' convenient method of forcing this monstrositytoward its inevitable conclusion. sure, this minion of satan mayhave killed countless hundreds over the years, but how is hegonna do against a good old fashioned american butt kickin'?after prosatano has been vanquished, killed by his own scepter (ienvied him, he did not have to watch bezi steal calvin's walletagain), we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded manwho has been watching shutter, i mean shatter, and calvin ontheir quest. you see, it was foretold...somewhere...that twowarriors from the west would defeat prosatano. the silentbearded man who watched over the couple was none other thanjesus...i kid you not. he is listed as "prophet" in the end credits,but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle christianreference the film makers are trying to exhibit here.like in "i use a walker: texas ranger," norris is aging and cannotget into his fight scenes too much anymore. he kicks a lot, andpeople fly over furniture in slow motion, and then norris gives all ofhis line readings in that monotone voice of his. oh, what a realdirector might be able to fashion out of him! his brother, aaron,who has directed him in other films as well, has no sense of storyor momentum. scenes are thrown in for ego's sake, not toentertain. the scenes when the dynamic duo first meet bezi dragon and on, and then bezi is not all that important to the rest of thefilm.the film was shot on location in israel, which means theamericans could insult the israelis in person. there is not onelikeable israeli character here. the israeli police captain is a jerk.the cops' driver does not know english, and calvin convinces himthat the word "sh*tty" is a compliment. nothing funnier thanmocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf, especiallywhen all this racist humor is coming from an american minoritywho would have been more than offended if the tables were turnedand the israeli cop was mocking the african-american cop inchicago.this film is badly written, badly acted, and badly directed. it doesnot work as action, cop drama, or even horror. it just shows thatthe now defunct cannon studios was willing to throw their moneyinto anything, no matter how badly it was planned. "hellbound" issurely a most adequate title. i disliked this movie intensely.this is rated (r) for physical violence, gun violence, strongprofanity, some sexual references, and some adult situations.

this film is bad. not so bad it is good. just bad. it is however hilariously bad. i watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other chuck norris film ever again. if you have to choose between this film and death, you should happily choose this film, however, as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making (hence the hilarity).it is a constant depression to me, as i grind away at my desk job, that some people get to be involved in movie-making and decided to produce things such as this.1 out of 10. still better than "starship troopers" however.

this is the worst film i have ever seen, so bad it is astonishing. i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film: ok, it wasn't his fault that someone gave him those lines, but he could have refused the role, and tried to learn how to act instead. how did anyone get the money to put this film together. is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain? "oh yeah, they will love this one: it's got no believable plot, some kungfu movements, chuck norris, a black sidekick with bad corny lines, a sweet little israeli (or is he an arab, or does anyone care?) boy pickpocket, and the devil." brilliant, and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race.

i concur with the other users comment. hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. i think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. if anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. i feel i lost intelligence from watching this. i used to have a little respect for chuck norris before i watched this but now i just feel bad. i bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for $9.99 and i can honestly say i would have been better off literally throwing the money away. forgive me jesus.

this piece of crap is actually the bomb, as in bottom of the barrel. i can't figure out which is worst; norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or christopher neame's hysterical overacting. this film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. the action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. you can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.visually the film does nothing for me. it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice rip-off with a little sprinkling of hell-spawn. no, wait. that should have been hell-yawn.

norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create armegeddon. he eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. unlikely? so is the rest of the movie. much of it consists of cn and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. the israeli (or arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize cn. ok. doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit. also, no cops ever every get invited out of the country to be interviewed by other cops. it is ridiculous as a premise. the whole thing is bad. unfortunately, it's not so bad as to be entertainingly bad or campy. just plain bad. but--one can see how norris was trying to find his way to the successful walker: texas ranger series.

for the most part, i considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. you see, right then we learn (spoilers...if they can be called that) that the devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! "prosatanos" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion chuck norris! imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on jackie chan... (*1/2)

this is a god awful norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever in calvin levels and a weak script. the characters were terrible, and it has hardly any action,plus even chuck norris stinks in this!. christopher neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting plus norris seemed bored with the whole thing and i don't blame him as i was too!. calvin levels gives one of the most annoying performances in a movie ever, i couldn't stand as i was tempted to rip the tape out of my vcr, plus norris and levels had no chemistry together!. if your looking for some great martial art moves from norris don't go near this, however if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, hardly any action and bad acting look further!. this is a god awful norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever from calvin levels, avoid it like the plague!. the direction is incredibly bad. aaron norris does an incredibly bad job here, with no suspense or thrills bland camera work, and keeping the film at a dull pace!. there is a little bit of blood and violence. we get 2 gory impaling's,ripped out heart, exploding body and a few gunshot wounds. the acting is really bad. chuck norris is not amazing as he usually is here and seemed very bored here, his one liners are flat, and his acting wasn't that great and i am a huge norris fan, this is his absolute worst! (norris still rules!).calvin levels is incredibly annoying here, his whiny wimpy performance severely grated me, i was so hoping for him to get it good!, but sadly he didn't. christopher neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he over acted big time!. sheree j. wilson is beautiful and did okay with what she had to do. rest of the cast are terrible. overall please avoid this it's not worth the torture, even if you are a huge norris fan (like me). bomb out of 5

this movie stunk. there is not much more to it. the final fight looked like walker taking on my grandmother, not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. i found the commercials more interesting. the plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away. the only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended. avoid this at all costs...unless you enjoy bad chuck norris movies.

all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future, and there wasn't. i'll admit to not finishing the film, i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and i quote, "more tail than any man in the past time." i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be like,and i'm not against lesbians. thank you mr. director! someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait i have it! there's no sequel!

pure schlock from beginning to end. the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test. like one of those so-so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say.you'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. however, it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how's that for role reversal), and lesbian soap operas. the ghost of valerie solanis lives!

i don't think this can legally qualify as "film." the plot was so flimsy, the dialogue so shallow, and the lines so terrible that i couldn't believe that someone actually wrote the lines down, said, "holy sh*t! this is a masterpiece" and then actually pitched it to a producer. i, for one, am still dumbfounded and will forever remember this film as the mark of the degeneracy of intelligence in america -- that, and "crossroads," of course.

the plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. despite the somewhat promising premise, the movie falls flat in nearly every regard. the dialogue is laughable. the characters are paper thin. the exploration of a single-gender world is shallow. the worst part of the entire movie is the asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit.i can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced. most of the movie is male bashing. "all men are violent." "all men rape women." "men are only animals." all of the women - even the 'closet hetero cases' - seem to display anger toward-, fear of-, and hatred for men. if you want to see a sci-fi film something along the lines of this movie's premise, you'd do best to look elsewhere.

they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. the funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.ok, the plot. some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. so then all the men are killed or something. so there are no more.then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent. the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man. not long after, he takes the blonde's' volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where he's discovered. now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way. the police chase him.i didn't watch the rest but it probably ends up that they've got to race against the clock and some people, or something bad will probably happen. somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion. these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they'd single handedly get rid of a planet full of women, but i didn't watch. and neither should you.if you're up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on, don't watch. watch anything but this. you'll find those ads for bowflex or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to 'pick up the phone to meet women just like these' in your area will be more satisfying entertainment.(oh yeah, there's this funny thing when they're pulling in with their cars. i don't know what they did, it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird.) the blonde girl was kind of cute and i'm feeling generous, so... 2/10.

... but had to see just how bad it could get. the plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. a female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'lesbian conspiracy'. the entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. press a few buttons and ding you get a baby. not only that, but he will age to mid 20's in a month, and then begin to age normally (how convenient). eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to 'see the city'.this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient plot twists, and several subplots that we never see resolved. as adam quickly learns, what men did survive are treated as outcasts/criminals, because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence. the propaganda machines have been in full swing, scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers. this has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of christianity, female only reproduction via cloning, and oh yeah world peace among other implied results. all of which seem unlikely given that only ~30 years had elapsed since the war. adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, all the while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf. with the fbi on his trail, madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to recapture him (for herself it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all.all in all, i would not recommend this movie.i did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the 'love to hate her' director of the fbi, and julie bowen didn't do bad as hope the 'closet hetero' geneticist either.

this movie is awful beyond belief. it's a low-budget, badly written, piece of pointless garbage. but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i've ever spent in front of the television. the badness of this movie is epic -- maybe not ed wood epic, but close. the premise is hysterical (men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in -- haw! -- football stadiums), the pseudo-dyke culture is laughably bizarre (there's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service "deviants") and the "last man" of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show. i didn't get to see the end of it, which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy "what have we all learned from this?" nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth, but everything in the first two-thirds was so memorably bad, even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest, it's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy, stupid, brainless sci-fi b-flicks.

it's a male bashing bonanza. i saw this on sci-fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting. it could have been a good movie, and the plot itself i don't see as male bashing, but certain specific references to men get really annoying. i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non-violent as they claim, but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing. i mean, i can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after awhile. not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go "in the closet". it's just too unbelievable. there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible. i mean i know its sci-fi, and i love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible, and this is too implausible. the phrase "truth is stranger than fiction" came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but truth isn't always. this movie is not that. other than that, the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, do redeem it a little, but not enough.

i have read each and every one of baroness orczy's scarlet pimpernel books. counting this one, i have seen 3 pimpernel movies. the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this. it goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. i don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script. sticking with the 80's version....rahne

the screen writers for this mini-series should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves. they butchered a very fun story and squandered the talents of richard e. grant. the only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. all of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same. i strongly suggest watching another version of the scarlet pimpernel. any other version is better than this one.

i have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. i absolutely adored everything that i have been acquainted previously. but lately i've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. i still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read. so an idea dawned on me - sink me! there are movies which i have not watched! thus, i must watch them immediately.the first five minutes of these series were... acceptable. in fact, i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed. it went all downhill from there, though. chauvelin was too... foppish? and, i daresay, too old for this role. not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or. (and what was that with random bed scene featuring him? it was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the madame guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - sir percy?) marguerite... prettiest woman in france? cleverest woman in europe? i think not. although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir percy i haven't the faintest idea. and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death? yes, every member of the league did pledge his life to sir percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. and if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened. which brings me to another point, sir percy. his portrayal was most dreadful. he was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) and with his own hands he had never killed anyone. so what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people?the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well. this is post-revolutionary france we are talking about! not pre-revolutionary. people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily. it was all just... gah!although, i must admit, after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly. watching it as a separate work, independent of scarlet pimpernel series, it was tolerable. just your other average hero in the mask. but for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable.

i don't know why they even kept the name. how they could call the series 'the scarlet pimpernel' after they deviated from the novels so much, i wouldn't have a clue. the character names are the only things they kept, and even then they changed a few of those, and mixed them up, and changed percy's relationships with them. admittedly, i only watched about two hours at the most of it, but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like baroness orzcy had portrayed her characters, and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing. poor lady. i hope that when the next person wants to make a movie/series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did.

before i start to tear apart this movie, mark you--i love the scarlet pimpernel. that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the hottest thing there. so, i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc film.to my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.there were no exciting escapes with daring disguises. there was no deep love that made your heart flutter as percy left the room and marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again.all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out-of-the-blue sex and violence.sink me! what a horrible movie!

having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrews/janeseymour version, i have to say that this is not good at all.according to the books, percy is supposed to be a seeminglyfoppish aristocrat when he's being percy, and witty and cleverwhen he's being the pimpernel, but here he just looks bored aspercy and mean as the pimpernel. marguerite is supposed to bethe most beautiful woman in europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due tobad make-up). richard e. grant has done much better things, andelizabeth mcgovern's acting is uninspired and flat. the wit anddash of the books and the andrews/seymour film is here replacedby brawn and flashy editing that just don't make the cut.  i might add that to a person who hasn't seen any previous versionor read the book, it would probably look ok.

in case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's samuel l. jackson-eugene levy clunker the man. this 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly billy crystal and the late ethiopian shim-shammer gregory hines together as some witty chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. that's pretty much the extent of the movie. interest is somewhat peaked by hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to will smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like memento's joe pantoliano and "nypd blue's" jimmy smits. my favorite scene is, i dunno, the car chase on the tracks, i guess. basically, i just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks. well, this and lethal weapon 4... and rush hour 2... and the man...

this movie is juxtaposition of various super bad tough guy biker characters, loosely connected but with no real storyline. some of the scenes are nicely filmed. if they took the same cast and crew, and made a movie called the gent who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent. as it is, prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros, all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting sunburned and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money, etc. there was a sort of background story about the characters pasts various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot.

larry bishop, the writer/actor/director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. the actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. the hell with the ride. the film is a bomb.the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. they are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists. pistolero, played by larry bishop, is the revengeful leader of the pack. the gent (michael madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. comanche (eric balfour) is loyal, but mysterious. deuce, performed by david carradine, should have passed on the ride, and so should the ticket-buyers (if you decide to see the film, you'll be sorry, but you'll find out why). billy wings (vinnie jones) is a lewd and venomous character, completely filled with disdain.what puzzles me is how this film, with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity, ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere. ticket-buyers, take my advice: don't pay for the ride. please don't make the same mistake as the investors.the first fifteen minutes, or so, of the movie is confusing and unintelligible. the dialog, which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues, doesn't make any sense. the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere. poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. he, too, should have passed on the ride. there are decapitated heads, slashed throats, and nude females wrestling. it is clear that bishop doesn't know where he is going with the film. he gets entirely lost. but, by the end of the ride, you just won't give a damn. mama mia! stay home. and, by all means, don't take the ride. i rate this film a 1 out of 10, but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero.

i would not recommend it whatsoever. it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so i couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). i have to say i was embarrassed. filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. yuck. actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were david carradine and dennis hopper. it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers. you know what i mean. blablabla. the filming was grainy and just a very low quality. there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.

once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker.now, unfortunately, he not only makes terrible films, but puts his names to ones like this.a supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s, this plumbs new depths.believe you me, i enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this. to use a word i never thought i would, its msysoginistic (you see, i can't even spell it.) the plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as vinnie jones' accent, the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think of.this is just terrible. shocking. it almost made me cry. in horror.

this is my first "awful" rating ever on imdb and i couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator."hell ride", directed, written by and starring larry "friend of qt" bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged. larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, focusing instead of putting his swaying, strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it. he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire puns/metaphors to put one off the word "fire" for life.dennis hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so lucky. sometimes they hit the road on their bikes, making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen, since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film. there is plenty of silicon-enhanced nudity, but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever, making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind.my guess is that most people who watch this film, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated. do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead.

this film oh my god this film is so poor , i'm amazed i managed to watch it all ..first off id like to say that vinny jones should only play a london thug period that's it end of story ..pisttolero is so unconvincing its almost comedy.. banging in dennis hopper and david carradine did not save this film .. in fact i think its a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star..avoid at all costs .. vinny oh my god i thought i saw it all when he played that irish tinker :pi think the average viewer will realize that this film is maybe just a never will be type of film.. i cant see how anybody could actually fall this crap

this movie makes "glitter" look like "schindler's list." tarantino and the weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. green-lighting a p.o.s. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. larry bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. writer/director/producer/actor bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. a vanity project gone south, "hell ride" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in. (which is virtually every scene!) my final three words on "hell ride" are stink, stank, stunk.

this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen in a long long time (and i've recently seen starship troopers 2!!!). i could find nothing to redeem this film. the acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. michael madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. denis hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. vinnie jones accent is bizarre. one positive thing is that leonor valera looks fantastic. her acting is pretty poor but i doubt that's why shes there.the dialogue is truly appalling. it is quite simply rubbish. i don't know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round.this film is the reason imdbs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. avoid at all costs.

okay, so writer/director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. good for him! now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. "hell ride" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived grindhouse cinema formula in general. with "hell ride", larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his set-up and there are many obvious reasons for this. he hasn't got a story to tell  or at least not a very interesting one  but gravely tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists, loads of gratuitous and very women-unfriendly sleaze, overlong and piteous dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence. the plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence. the ancient vendetta between two rivaling biker gangs flares up again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a double-crossing wench that got executed back in 1976. that's it, seriously! all the rest, going from betraying gang members over to the recruitment of old timer members over to toying with his nymphomaniac informant girl, is all completely pointless and confusing padding material. another major problem in "hell ride" is larry bishop's very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego. he definitely shouldn't have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader, as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow-minded; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie. granted, bishop starred in a couple of genuine 60's biker exploitation movies (like "the savage seven" and "angel unchained"), but that was a long time ago and he honestly isn't any good as an actor. maybe it simply was bishop's life-long dream to play a character that always outsmarts his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves, and just wrote a whole screenplay around it. the veterans in the cast, like dennis hopper and michael madsen, don't really bother to leave a plausible impression and i can't say i blame them. this whole production is lame and pathetic and i can't bring myself to recommending it to anyone, regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked butts.

larry bishop is 60-years old, dirty and not good-looking yet in this movie he's like a drug towards the women in their twenty's.a lot of movies have been claimed to be sexist but if any movie deserves that title it's this one.i can't even count how many boobs there were shown in this movie, probably more then hours larry bishop spend writing the script.the script is ridiculous, bishop and his gang argue, bike, party, have sex, kill people and the next day they argue, bike, party, have sex, kill people and the third day, well you get the idea.i like eric balfour and considering what he had to work with, he did pretty good as comanche.unfortunately this movie is about larry bishop's character pistolero who is so one-dimensional it's not even funny.he's also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to do the lead himself but everybody he asked said no so what was he to do? once he realized he was gonna do the lead himself, he probably did a re-write of the script so that he could touch up more ladies.although visually it's kind of good-looking, at least the biker-scenes and eric balfour isn't half-bad this movie is just a big mess.i hope to never see larry bishop in front of the camera again.

the worse film i have every seen. like the other honest reviewers, it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out. don't get wrong, naked women isn't a bad thing but there is another film genre for that. boyfriends beware. i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place. slap in the chops for me.what makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically - what biker bars have these? they are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs! completely unrealistic.the acting is terrible, loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline.did anyone check out vinnie jones's attempt at an american accent? its as embarrassing as his football skills.avoid like the plague. the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p@rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks!

that's what i kept asking myself while watching this film. i mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of storyline. really i just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but i persisted. i persisted in the hope that maybe the storyline would get better, that there might be a good twist at the end. however i couldn't have been more wrong. in the end i persisted because i figured i could write a bad review for it if anything after watching it. i mean don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director only shows that along with a shitty story thinking it's what the viewer wants to see, it insults us all. to think we are all so shallow to only want to see burlesque from rep ratable, big movie industry players is preposterous. my advice: hire a different movie.

when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. with character names like "pistolero", "comanche" and "the gent" i braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. the dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while "cc rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. yawn! the three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. seeing old men like bishop and madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth. poor eric balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing, couldn't save it. and let's talk about the store bought tans shall we? many have compared this to tarantino's work. it is not even close. what makes tarantino's work so brilliant is he knows it's over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible. bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre.

this film is so bad it's hilarious. i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy, although i couldn't quite work out if they were actually taking the p*ss, or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent. i notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious! it's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine. one scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads, then showing each other 'get out of jail free' cards that they've made! also check out vinnie jones' accent, where the hell is he meant to be from?!? oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b*stards! the guy who wrote and directed it - a pee wee herman lookalike with a greeshan 2000'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has for some reason cast himself in the lead role, maybe this is part of the joke, i don't know. actually, the more i think about it the more i'm sure this film is a p*ss take. it's produced by quentin tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh. it is a total rip off of tarantino's style, but just done really really badly. it is very amusing though, and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic, either from being an amusing parody of the tarantino/rodriguez style, or something that is very very unintentionally funny. has to be seen to be believed.

larry bishop directs, writes, and leads this soft core porn, plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything. to call this one of the worst movies of 2008 is being kind to the garbage that i spent money on while in theaters. its one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i felt sorry for the girls mostly, who probably think they're in the making of a feature film, when in all reality they're making a porno. they walk on the set for four days, say some sexual lines to disgusting old men -- thirty years older than them -- then take off their cloths, and run around naked for the four days they're on set. i can only assume this was larry bishops only way to get laid. you see shot after shot directly on a girls asses. shot after shot of bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her most intimate parts, as if he were shaking her hand. how this crap was even funded is beyond me. why tarantino has his name on it is beyond me, but he's been slowly fading away since 1994, so i can't say i was surprised.after 15 minutes, you get that awful feeling that only horrible (and i mean horrible) movies give you. when you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is amplified. after 15 minutes, i wanted to cry for being so stupid, and wasting, not only my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. there isn't one redeeming quality, or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people had any idea of what they are doing. if you don't see naked women all that often, then i guess this movie would be for you. if you're eleven-years-old, you will probably like it. you can't even laugh at it, because every idiot making it was laughing about the crap they were making. the acting is awful, the writing is awful, the production is awful, and the directing is awful. it's not even worth your time renting it to see the car crash. stay away, stay very far away. you shouldn't even be reading these reviews. i shouldn't even be writing one.

i have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. hell ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. the problem with hell ride is, unlike pf and rd, the story is garbage and so is character development. how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from? the brief case in pulp fiction, the air gun in no country, etc. etc. speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie? i couldn't help but laugh at those scenes where he's standing with his pelvis trusted out, desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker. nothing in this movie is believable. and why dennis hopper? did they really need the easy rider motif too? i blame larry bishop, for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role. don't bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.

director/lead larry bishop tried way, way too hard with hell ride. the movie wants to be edgy, witty, provocative, outlandish, biting all of this, seemingly in a quentin tarantino/rob zombie style. but it's not edgy. the references seem forced. the dialog tries to be clever and fails. the humor is never funny. nice try setting a gritty tone but we'd have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed.what you're left with are cool harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized sergio leone western. if this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films, kudos for it. but on its own, it is rather boring and irrelevant. i do believe there is a place for style over substance. but this movie is not it.

i haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! talk about so bad it made me laugh!firstly, i estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length, i couldn't tell what was happening, or indeed even what i was seeing. i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets lsd. there are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable stuff. i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening, but they couldn't follow it any better than me.then there are the "black" moments, when in an effort to scare us (woooooooo) everyone's lights go out and the screen turns pitch black - and i don't just mean for a few seconds. i think the longest lasted almost two minutes. i guess blank film is one way to keep costs down...i suspect the "director" had recently read a book on all the "must-do's" to make a scary movie, and decided to throw them all in - about 20 times each.there are three good things about this film: 1/ it's short at 90 minutes (though still an hour and a half too long!) 2/ all the characters die (after all, it's impossible to care about any of them). 3/ there was one genuinely good scene - when the group are looking up the shaft they came down, after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom (saw that coming), a large boulder is pushed across the opening, sealing them in. i wasn't expecting that, and it was genuinely chilling.and what's with the early campfire scenes with the shot, after shot, after shot panning from behind the camp lights. i swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes.and i'm positive that after the first kill, the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds.all in all, a crap piece of film making. i'll watch almost anything, but this is close to where i'd draw the line.

i am an avid movie watcher and i enjoy a wide variety of films. however, i found no enjoyment in this movie. it is probably the worst movie i have ever seen. i do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. it is definitely not in the same category as "the cave" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made. even "the descent" was better than this movie.it was a waste of the $3.79 rental fee and of my time to watch this. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one.

i have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. you get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. it really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. i have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, i imagine that caves are dark. showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home. i quite enjoyed "the descent" which, for my money had better acting, showed more tight caving situations, better monsters and had a good ending.****spoiler******the monster turns out to be some guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed, leaving him to grow up in the caves. he seems to have developed super strength and speed, but why is never addressed - maybe the same force that drained their torch batteries caused this but during the film whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something large with claws that tears up each victim (see how much blood splatters the walls!) but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask? i would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case. then he starts raping the last remaining caver and roll credits... almost absurdly bad i thought. sometimes a film is soo bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh, but this films fails to take itself lightly as well. you watched it, you can't unwatch it!

if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would. i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, i'll spend £10 and buy it. all i got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. absolutely awful, i don't even know where to begin. i have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it. the plot is basically, 7 people go into an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. no-one else knows they are there. when they get in the cave, they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster. there turns out to be no reason for the reporter. one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago... there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either, just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume? anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life. this for no reason makes him superhuman, able to glow, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in 2 places at once and have insane strength (able to move boulders, carry grown men as dead weight, etc). in the end scene there are 2 women left alive, they wake up naked, just covered in some bit of rug or something. they then find a picture of a kid. the monster then bursts in the door, wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head (says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull, if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life) and quite literally goes "raaahhh" like a kiddie on halloween. i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing. the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave. that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story. the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one, cut to end credits. i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film. he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene.there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end. aside from all this, the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off. an absolutely terrible film. you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it, it would be money better spent, as like some clever person posting above me said, once you've watched it, you can't un watch it.

i consented to watching this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike for horror movies. however, it was not the shock of a monster that turned me off this movie, it was the horrendous acting and absolutely disgusting ending. within, or the cavern, has no redeeming qualities- it is poorly made, laughably scripted, sickeningly bloody and the inclusion of the gratuitous final scene repulses me. no, it is not my dislike for horror movies that makes me hate this film-i've seen such wonderful teen horrors as "house of wax", its the fact that the film leaves you with the awful understanding that by renting the video, you are supporting the creators of within

what a shocker. for starters, i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. the jerky camera movements were also annoying. the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. and then there's the ending. i'm still not really sure what to make of it. i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.the case had a couple of those little award winner/nominations symbols on it, so i figured it couldn't be too bad. i was wrong. if you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.

if it is true that the movie only cost 150k to make, it explains a lot. but, it doesn't explain why it has no real plot. midway through the movie i honestly didn't care if they made it out or not. i just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. the ending was really dumb and made me wish i would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early. pretty good acting considering there wasn't much to go with. if you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting (even for a cave)and bad camera work (even for a cave)... then you'll really like this movie. by the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so, how could he have forgotten how to speak, and built up so much anger?? wouldn't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later?

the person who wrote the summary and rave review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies. from the beginning, this just spoke of cheap-ass ripoff of "the descent", a far superior film that definitely does not start off slow.from the very first moments of "the cavern", i was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and unoriginal it was, how badly written, badly acted and badly directed it was. this is without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life, and that's saying a lot, considering i recently suffered through "pulse". i can't believe this piece of garbage actually won awards, which just goes to show the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in australia and other countries than in the u.s.the scenes where the group is running from the "creature" are badly directed, especially the retarded "upside-down-camera", intended to show disorientation, but only coming off as a cheap effect which a first-year film student would be suitably berated for by their teacher.sadly, this "director" will probably go on to make other movies, more than likely of the same low quality as this "film", since i'm sure he hasn't learned from his mistakes, which on this picture were excessive.if i had my way, the entire cast and crew would be sent up the river for life without parole. this film is a crime against humanity.

i love movies...and rarely do i see a movie that i hate...but this was the worst movie i have ever seen, or at least close to it. any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. hands down... i cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. i'm really mad, i want my money back and my time back. awful! do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful. i didn't know what was going on during half the movie cause i could not see it(and i was watching on a very nice, and big, tv) rent saw, the hills have eyes, or house of wax...any of those are better if u want something scary.

horror films are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well, sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems, sometimes they're so bad they're actually kinda fun...and sometimes they're "the cavern".a good horror/suspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die. however, the cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first, only to be negated by it's own lackluster storytelling.all the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue, making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way.(to spoil a scene a bit, one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasn't reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick macaroni and cheese) add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many nine inch nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level.i'll be honest with you, if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch "the descent", and i feel weird saying that because i didn't particularly enjoy that movie either.

i can't say if "the cavern" is a ripoff of "the cave" because i haven't seen that. i've seen "the descent" and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one. hard to watch, as in, there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at. there are times when i guess, you're supposed to be scared, judging from the music, but scared of what? bad camera work? poor lighting? if that's the case than this should be the scariest movie made. the story is that a bunch of cave explorers go to a cave in kazakhstan (home of borat) and make their descent, but something is (of course) in there with them. and what is it? one guy says it's a wolf/bear hybrid, that is, just before he gets ripped apart, but whatever it is, you can't see it. and just when you think (or hope) the film is ending, since the screen goes dark for a bit, you see the two remaining cavers (the two women) wake up somewhere in betty and wilma attire and start trying to find their way out of wherever they are. they do drink some water and start eating something until they figure out what it is and start puking....and then the mystery of what's in the cave appears, and you'll just be astounded. maybe, maybe not. dumb dumb dumb....i think i'm pretty well done with cave movies at this point, 2 out of 10.

first let me say that those of you that voted it "10" are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level... something that this movie doesn't deserve. (the only movies deserving a 10 imo are the classics... godfather, shawshank, etc. look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list.) i also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave. though i would have to agree with them on the surroundings, they simply aren't rating the movie as a whole... they are infatuated by the surroundings but miss the overall review. that would be like me voting a 10 for the movie "from justin to kelly" because i think that the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the florida keys... though that may be true, it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was rancid.i wish i could tell you that something saved this movie, as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick, something else picks up or makes up for the weakness. (ex. - bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot and/or great camera work and scenery.) we started the dvd and it all started out fairly normal. we jokingly started to pick out who would be the first to die... after a brief bit of driving and hiking, they set up camp for the night. at that moment, i keyed in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film. two main problems i had: bad effects and an even worse story line. the first thing that we all noticed was that the campfires weren't real... you can plainly see the "cgi" or fake flames that they were all sitting at. for a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what i was in for the next hour.only minutes later, i was shown how poorly written this film was. i don't remember exactly how they arrived at the point, but basically, we find out that the "token nerd" is writing a book about exploring caves, etc. another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates stating "i don't want this story in your book." the author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (a direct quote: "if i tell you the story, you will definitely want it in your book.") at this point, i was fully expecting a nice 5+ minute story, complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. what i got was a short, poorly told (and acted) statement. i say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. i don't remember the exact quotes, but basically he says: "we were in a cave, the cave flooded, a girl died as our friend watched her drown." you may think i am over exaggerating and being really critical, but that isn't far off from a direct quote, line for line, from the movie scene.over the next 50 minutes or so, the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what i would imagine to be like in a cave, i could have really done without the really fuzzy/hazy look to the film, and the camera shaking is just one that i didn't go for. (i have really good vision, and after watching the main parts of the film, i felt like i was legally blind.) i was emotionally detached from this movie, therefore the parts that probably should have been scary weren't. maybe had i been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film, i would have at least been scared, but i don't remember anyone in the dark room even twitching at any of the "action" scenes.the last scene was probably one i will never forget, and that isn't a good thing. basically, two women are trapped in a room naked. the "monster" comes in to attack/kill the women... he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. a flashback occurs where we find out that the "monster" was injured as a little boy, and spent his entire life in the cave. cut back to present time, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt). he glances at the picture and the two women appear to have found the caveman's weakness/soft spot. at that point, he stabs and kills one girl, then proceeds to rape the other woman, rather graphically. after about 30 seconds of watching the camera jiggle and shake as he rapes her, roll the credits, movie's over.honestly, if i had to do it all over and i wasted money on renting this movie, i could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that i have now.those of you comparing this to blair witch are way off... if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of blair would realize how revolutionary it was... handing each cast member a script the day/night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius.if imdb would let me, it would get a negative score... i don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.

a group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in kazakhstan. in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, the cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an x-file. i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. not being a caver, it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic. there is entirely too much unnecessary pannick from supposedly experienced cavers, by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things  oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves, or i hope you all die by the end. it must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film. a moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters. while you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. but i would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor. it just wasn't necessary. i suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel. i've long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme. you pay for the materials to make the film before you go in, but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. i can't blame what i don't like about this film on its low budget.

sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". we should all pay more attention to that little voice. this may be the worst movie i've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your dvd player has a fast-forward button. made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, "the cavern" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like "the cave" and "the descent". a few years back there was similar rash of look-alike movies that used sea-going vessels instead of caves. all had scary boats/submarines-lots of darkness-claustrophobic adventurers-unknown menaces...same old same old. "the cavern" is really "the blair witch project" only this time we're lost under the earth and not lost on top of it. throw in a flashlight with failing batteries, a cow skull with fangs glued on it for a monster, and one of the stupidest "twist" climaxes ever put on film. that being said, let me urge you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. i'm your friend. i want you to have a happy life. stay away from this movie.

when i checked out the review for this film after i'd watched it, i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings.this is a film of bad camera-work. everything 'frightening' happens off screen, usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling "did you see/hear that?" well, no, we didn't see that! we can't! and when there weren't any close-ups, the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down, or shaking back and forth really, really quickly, to either convey action or to make us physically sick.the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes, they started screaming the same thing over and over again. i don't care if that's what it would 'really' be like, i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! i expect unreasonable things, like aliens, demons, or good acting! they were stupid, too- let's go have intimate relations in a cave! with all of our clothes on! speaking of which, the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died. this bugged me a bit, though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a... serious invasion of one girl's privacy.no plot, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera-work. what's left? oh, right. the ending may have had a 'twist' but generally with horror movies, the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film. sixth sense does- it explains a lot. hide and seek did, too. but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an 'explanation', if you could call it that as it doesn't. explain. anything.don't see it. please.

it's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. there just isn't a lot to say about it. it is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and i have a considerable amount of noirs.paul henreid plays a tough guy in here. he's not one i would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. he's a fine actor, anyway.everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. one thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. that was a surprise. it was also a surprise to see this under the heading "hollow triumph." i've never seen the film called that. it's always been called "scar."if you read about a "tense film noir," etc., don't believe it. "tense" is not an accurate adjective for this film.

very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. it is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of r. lee ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect i found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. the first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something i've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. after 30 minutes i got the idea and wished they could just get on with it. the drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut-outs. the general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant shouting. the boys make it through their training and end up in vietnam. oh, and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant (what a surprise..), probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter. so, one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened. nothing...then we have the vietnam-part.it opens with a bunk-scene where reporters of stars and stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time. at first i thought they were re-enacting some movie scenes from old films, it sounded pretty bad. but no, they were actually muttering their script lines. then the camp is besieged. some 20 vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover. is that normal behaviour? were the vietnamese all suicidal? if so, how come the us didn't win this war during the first two months of engagement? the rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. furthermore, the whole plot is altogether pointless. none of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful. it shows little more other than some war-reporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets.what was the message of this movie..that people died in vietnam? that people are animals in war situations? that if you want to dispose of really dumb people, you send them to a war zone? or that somehow in vietnam concrete can actually burn? i'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, then apocalypse now deserves a 38.35/10

julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century. the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. the movie opens with a child, françois, growing up in the shadow of the hundred years' war, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. françois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. françois murders him in the name of defending his father's honour. like father like son, françois grows up, and leaves his family, also to go to the same war. this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come, as on his way home, we already notice that something is wrong with françois. the war has not done well with him, he has changed.the daughter, béatrice de cortemart (delpy), awaits her beloved father, to return from captivity of the english. she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. in her father's absence, béatrice needs to deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens béatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. but, upon his return, she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. from this points the film depicts various ways how françois torments his family. starting with humiliating his own son, and ending with the rape of his own daughter, béatrice.setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow, as the viewer may tell himself, that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times. and indeed, many films on the topic of incest, such as tim roth's "the war zone (1999)" which are contemporary were more shocking because of that.delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes. indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful.i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes. i believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for the making of this film, which really upsets me. the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals. i would hope that this movie will be re-released without those cruelty scenes. those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline.overall, the movie is too long. the script is problematic. we don't get to see françois and béatrice before the war, we don't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme. i would have pass on this film, however, i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching:* scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking. i saw it first time on "city of god (2002)". here, françois, murders his mother's lover, while his father away at war. excellent scene and very graphic. * the scenes from béatrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting. the scene after the rape, where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself. she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage.* the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food - humiliating him then ranting about the war. later, dressing his son with women's cloths.the film won the césar (french oscar) for best costume design, i agree, the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period. the movie location is château de puivert, a real 12th century castle and a historical monument, located in aude, south-central france. beautiful castle and mountain view, really helps you set into the period of this film. the film also nominated for 3 more césar awards, but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film "au revoir, les enfants" ("goodbye, children", 1998).--- released as "beatrice" in new york city, march 1987. only to be screened in france on november 2007. watched it on yes3 on 3 may 2007, 17:45, at work.

i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie. bad characters, bad story and bad acting. it would be a love story between a man and a mermaid. really awful.

i usually don't categorize a moving as boring. i am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. in fact i enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. diane lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. none of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience. i guess the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere were suppose to add to the story but it seems that they were inserted just to fill space. the scenes appeared choppy and incoherent. there were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach which were beautiful.

with all the potential for a good movie in its gorgeous settings, cast, and cinematography, this film's lacklustre script, leaden pace, and wooden performances produced only a major disappointment. with decent direction, editing, and musical score, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of blake edward's '10', instead of a weepy version of ron howard's 'splash'.

even sophie marceau's presence and the few (very few) good french gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie! a disappointment. the story is weak and so is acting. this movie was advertised as the french version of the mummy, but the mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects...

"an evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the louvre museum" that's all i think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself ! which i think it's one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema ! nothing good in here except the music (of the credits only !), some tender moments of (sophie marceau), and of course the movie's finale shot.. not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching that crap but also for being so perfect as one magical c.g.i work that was too good to be true in here ! by the way i want to change the plot summary to be like this "an evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies".. just like this one for sure.

if you thought this is the french the mummy and if you're hoping for another "vidocq"...well look elsewhere. it does have the same kind of story like the mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the louvre. i found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. the special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as i was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until i realized that those kind of scenes were in the mummy and this is belhpegor. apparently based on a french cult tv series, belphegor could have been so much better. i voted this film a 4/10 only for the beautiful sophie marceau...she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking!

a confusing, senseless script with plot holes the size of the eiffell tower. terrible acting by all involved - no exception! laughable and cheesy dialogue. lame attempts at humor and romance. extremely cheap special effects. all this makes for a giant mess of a film, you'd best avoid.

ok, i admit that i still associate sophie marceau with la boum. that was the main reason i went to see this film. but it was so boring, that i nearly felt asleep. sorry, but her talents as actress are not very convincing. furthermore, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and cgi. yeah, for a b-movie it is not that bad. after having seen her in "marquise" some years ago (also a very crappy film), i thought that she would play more convincingly. but la boum (and may be the james bond "the world is not enough") seem to be the only good films with her. is it her "talent", does she have a bad taste when choosing her films or simply bad luck ?

the movie is apparently based on a popular french horror novel, by arthur bernède, from 1927. not that i had ever heard about it before but belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. the first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. arthur bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. the character belphégor is one of his best known creations.once upon a time sophie marceau was a promising new european actress who would conquer hollywood. she has now however dropped back again to movies like this one. nothing wrong with playing in french quality movies, since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules.problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects, to make the movie good and scary. well, horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though, with some exceptions here and there. it's not like the special effects are bad in this one. especially for an european movie it is simply good but it;s just misplaced, since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect. it would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch, no doubt about that really. the movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch, also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach. at times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach, while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie. this is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level. you can say that the movie is even a bit boring. it all also definitely gets worse toward the ending. after a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead.the editing seems totally off. it uses too fast cuts, without much style, while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good, modern style. also the time-line is just plain messed up at times, as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order.the musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn't even sounds to fit the movie, as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting. i can't believe composer bruno coulais is an oscar nominated composer. the musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects.the movie is filled with many characters, which you however just couldn't care less about. it also just seems very unlikely that a woman like sophie marceau would ever fall for a man such as frédéric diefenthal. the movie also features julie christie, which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie.a horrible watch.3/10

this was a pretty dull movie, actually. i think the problem with a french horror film, is that the french must be easy to scare or something, because this movie wasn't just that frightening. the special effects with the mummy's ghost looked like they didn't even belong in the film, as though someone put them in during post-production to spice them up, because the actors barely react to them.the plot just kind of meanders, which is the opposite of real storytelling. i guess this was based on a french tv series, where they had to distill it down to a two-hour movie.the plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the louvre, which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times. (so that's how people keep stealing the mona lisa!) the boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960's version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon.so i'm not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not. he kills two guards during the course of the movie, but he just wants to get to the afterlife.

after putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, belphegor. due to convenient circumstances, lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. soon enough she's stealing the museum's egyptian treasures out from under their nose. detective verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.this is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of "belphégor" before. if you have, i recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery.it plays out like a (slightly) higher budgeted sci-fi original film, and i don't really mean that as a compliment.eye candy: sophie marceau shows ass & side boob my grade: c- dvd extras: none

my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of belphégor in the french 60's... so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation. i should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the louvre.the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting (the fantom of le louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. the dialogues hesitate permanently between french irony and serious "american business" without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine.acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect (low budget ?).what is left of all that. not much outside a few good shots of paris ... which is seldom a disappointment.belphégor was worth more than that.

i saw this movie only because sophie marceau. however, her acting abilities it's no enough to salve this movie. almost all cast don't play their character well, exception for sophie and frederic. the plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places. i saw several good french movies but this one i don't like.

it´s all my fault. they all told me i should avoid seeing this movie because i´m a huge fan of the old tv-series. they were right. while production values are good and the actors themselves (including "don´t look now") julie christie aren´t that bad, the whole film displays a cheekiness and self-conciousness that clearly is without any justification. a comparison between the karloff "mummy" and "the mummy returns 2000" comes to my mind. in fact belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new mummy films than to the old series. but then, scripting is terrible, speed there is none and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the tomb looks plain stupid), with cats clearly being thrown when they´re supposed to jump (landing with their backfeet first). belphegore moves around like a statue on wheels neither impressive nor scary and the psychological drama that unfolded in the old tv series when the heroine had to learn that she´s a villain is completely neglected. this movie is so wasted (wasted money, wasted actors, wasted blueprint) that it hurts. it´s a below-par mummy-rip off that´s only good for some laughs but has nothing at all to do with the greco classic (she has a small role in this movie too - on the graveyard).

seriously, sci-fi needs to stop making movies. they're all horrible. and this one had john rhys-davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. dr. pena (giancarlo esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by captain rudolf (john rhys-davies). the creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers. captain rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, guns ablazin'. but they can't stop it. so they call in the navy. they can't stop it either. then the thing kills all 5 (or however many of them there are). then the captain and his daughter along with some other guy, figure out how to kill it. stay away from this movie. the chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, the navy men shoot at the slightest movement,throw grenades on the ship, and the acting is horrible. 3/10.

horrible script, which was apparently directed by...no one? the marines can't fend off the monster with machine guns, however it backs off when a 15 year old girl karate kicks it in the face a few times. it's supposed to be a luxury liner, but the fancy dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. it appears that they rented a high school for the summer, and pulled out chairs and stuff to decorate the set with. in the end shot, they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks.how do movies like this get made? i guess anyone can be in a film these days. aaron james, nyc

first off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. the cast is like the saved by the bell reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always; the military is useless. it would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie. apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas, who get it the worst. the plot is thin, a nutcase cryptozoologist by the name of dr. peña traps the chupacabra. he then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it loose. you can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss a beat. the most noteworthy part that really makes it all worthwhile revolves around the captains daughter. toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt. let me get this straight, the monster wipes out the entire navy seals unit, while they are using armor piercing ammunition!! ok, its a movie it can happen right? but here comes the captains daughter who can't be older than 19 and kicks the crap out of the chupacabra with front and side kicks. it was hilarious. they should get a medal for coming up with that.

this is another sci-fi channel original movie staring rhys davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (john sheppherd helms all three.)basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn't believe a monster story.)no dramatic helicopter drop of the navy seals here. budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard. puleeze. also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. i also loved when the seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship. if the sci-fi channel is going to continue original movies i hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors. if this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin.

this is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies i've seen for awhile. i had to wonder if john ryhs-davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. th chupacabra looked like a cross between the sleetaks from land of the lost and the creature from the black lagoon. additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the chupacabra of legend is much smaller. all in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the chupacabra but the captain's kick-boxing daughter do ok?? watch if you are sick at home or feeling down and need a good laugh.

excerpt from tv guide:this week on the love boat, captain stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! join the captain, isaac, gopher and julie in a fun-filled halloween special. guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the chupacabra.this is typical, lame sci-fi channel cut-rate fare. the captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable john rhys-davies, is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of mexico. his daughter is along for the ride, and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. pay attention, everyone, that kickboxing will come in handy later! it should be noted that the captain's daughter is pretty uncoordinated and painful to watch. it would have been good if she might have taken a couple of kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie.captain stupid and his daughter join mrs. thurston howell from gilligan's island, a kooky cryptozoologist and a dark, mysterious stranger on this 90- minute ride into boredom.that's right, i said cryptozoologist. he keeps mentioning that he brought some precious cargo on board that he needs to check out. needless to say, the box contains a chupacabra that somebody decides to let out. from this point on, a man in the rubber chupacabra suit runs around the ship, killing people. captain stupid is powerless to stop it. he decides to call in the marines but telling them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship.the marines respond. they say all that marine-speak stuff like "hooya" and "get some". but those silly marines are no match for a chupacabra. they don't really tell anyone where they're going either, so there's no help in sight. i guess no one will really miss some lame battalion of lost marines. but don't forget... captain stupid's daughter is, thankfully, a kickboxing instructor. yay for little stupid! she comes in right in the nick of time, she beats up the bloodthirsty goat sucker and saves the day. chupacabra means goat sucker. therefore, chupacabras suck. but there's no way that chupacabras suck anywhere near as much as this movie.

oh my god... where to begin? "chupacabra terror" is one of the worst b-horror movies ever made. this crap makes "demon slayer" look like "the exorcist". special note: a horror b-movie needs to have at least one sex scene. don't expect even a hot girl in this one. with that inexcusable mistake, i should begin with the complete bash.first of all, if you're going to make a horror monster movie, you should spend big part of the budget in creating a "cool" monster outfit. the monster in this movie looks like a $10 halloween costume. there is no way the chupacabras (yes, this is how it is spelled) looks menacing in the movie. it's an actor in a halloween outfit please!! it looks so cheap it makes me mad. second, the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct to video monster horror movie. again, the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects. the blood looks damn fake! please take a close look at the guy that gets chopped in two. that's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts for about ten seconds. the ending is a very poor scene that won't leave you satisfied. the acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kind of movies; but in this movie it's beyond terrible. a cast of nobodies with no acting experience make the fool out of themselves for about 85 minutes. special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair that tries to convince swat members that he is sick. the coughing he fakes is beyond laughable. he's probably the worst actor ever in a b-horror movie, no kidding. also, captain peña delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the flick. the true story behind the chupacabras is not even told. all you get to know is that the monster sucks goat's blood. why bother with this piece of crap? plesae, do not even watch it even if you have the chance. not even if it airs on cable. i usually support low budget horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something "different" than hollywood but that doesn't means that horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage.

chupacabra terror: 2/10: it was the navy seal team that tipped the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad. up till then there was a lot of bad movie baggage but the seals they are wearing bicycle helmets painted black. you know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool. of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another clue (it wouldn't make it across tampa bay let alone an ocean) and their tactics wouldn't pass muster on an 3rd rate xbox game.does director john shepphird have photos of john rhys-davies in a compromising position with a hobbit? because i can't think of any other reason he would be in this movie. the other actors have a great excuse. they are talentless unattractive hacks that couldn't get hired for an infomercial. the plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical chupacabra (love saying that name) aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose.the sets consist of horrible cruise ship fakery (complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment), the monster killings are bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity, and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes. of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60's doris day movie.the cast bleeds ketchup while the chupacabra bleeds day green glow in the dark blood. (why a goat eating mexican mammal would bleed anything but red is beyond me.)every b movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun time (hey it's a lesbian shower scene, omg that guy just ate is own eyeballs) or not so fun (did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing coveralls and bicycle helmets navy seals?) chupacabra falls into the not so fun b movie side with a thud.

just been on sci-fi channel uk, 5th july, its was ****. shame on jrd! may be he was bored one week ! he cant be skint after lotr. i suppose he wasn't to blame. mr sheppird was. i turned off after 50 minutes, couldn't bear it. the cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat. who funded this project? i think the whole thing must have cost $250 bucks. avoid at all costs, don't think about buying the dvd if they release one, i cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one. lets hope someone makes a decent chupra film and a decent bigfoot movie. sasquatch was okay, poor lance. its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it, no more super hero films please!

i watched this movie knowing that it would be awful, but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. the plot is deep rising with cruddy effects and horrid acting. the lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the english language. the sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. you won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it. there are scenes/plot devices straight out of deep rising, alien, jurassic park, predator, jeepers creepers, and the list could go on forever. however, unlike any of those movies this one just falls short of celluloid stool. the most incredulous thing about this film, aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails, is that gimli him-freakin'-self is in it. how the hell can they afford john rhys-davies but not decent effects, writing, actors, or sets. really awful...and not the type of bad that's good.

"chupacabra terror" is saved from a '1" by the presence of canadian cutie chelan simmons as the heroine. she is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side. otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of the relic. john rhys-davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported. and the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit. he does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome. formulaic, to say the least. i love the moment when simmons ominously tells someone what chupacabra stands for: goat eater! oooohhh...scary!

i didn't like this movie for so many reasons i can't even say then all.i thought it was poorly made just because of the whole story line. i mean who is gonna believe that they captured the chupacabra and it broke loose on a cruise liner. lame!!! it was all right for a lame straight to video movie,but not worth spending money on it. i can't believe someone actually gave this movie a ten. but i guess there are people that like this movie. i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and it had the guy off of lord of the rings. if you want to see this movie i would stay home and wait till it comes on sci-fi channel. don't waste your money on seeing this movie. believe me.

in case you're wondering the buffoonish loren c*****n of (cryptozoology inafame) is a living idiot and any information he's provided is to be tossed out with the trash. the guy simply is a news paper clipper.as for the story line it was was a predictable train wreck, the actors were mechanical, the lighting was awful, and the props/clothing was cheap.bobcat goldwait should have starred over the clowns in this film. i was physically ill after seeing ten minutes of it.there are insane/retarded monkeys still in charge of films i see.dan

without john rhys-davies, i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter. but in spite of that single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the stiff acting and the sci fi channel aspects. the blood effects are very convincing, and the chupacabra actually looks realistic... regardless of what you think a chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking chupacabra.aside from the positives, this runs kind of like kolchak: the night stalker (darren mcgavin, remember?) meets the love boat, but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work, it still holds something resembling a plot, and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes.as conflicted as this work is, i still managed to find some enjoyment herein. maybe you will, too.it rates a 5.2/10 on the made 4 tv scale.it rates a 4.1/10 on the movie scale from...the fiend :.

i found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. the characters are not believable, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. the only part of the film i enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed. the special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. a typical unimaginative slasher flick.it's hard to believe, make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots. equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly were to find it, in spite of the fact the creature has evaded capture, or even photographing.the man that pulls off the impossible in capturing the chupacabra alive is our one dimensional dr. pena (giancarlo esposito). the only thing dr. pena is more obsessed with than the creature is his dart gun. a dart gun that works were mere bullets fail.the captain of the ship (john rhys-davies) is introduced as a 'war veteran'. he employs his military prowess by having his men shoot at the creature, regardless of were on the ship they happen to be. the navy seals that show up from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything.dylan neal plays an insurance investigator brought on board the cruise ship to catch a thief. he spends most of the movie tagging along with whomever is trying to kill the creature at the moment.the creature doesn't even closely resemble a chupacabra. it doesn't behave like one either. instead of a small, shy, secretive animal that hunts by stealth at night, we get a bulletproof freddy kruger, killing everything in sight. a simple search on google would have been very helpful to the writers and the special effects crew.

apparently in early 2005, scifi channel threatened to release the incriminating photos they have of john rhys-davies and said, "we need you to star in another scifi original." the scary thing is, he's actually pretty damn good in this movie. that's really saying something since this is a silly scifi creature feature; you've gotta put some feeling into it in order to be well-acted. unfortunately, nobody else does. it's your stereotypical "moster-run-amok" movie on a cruise ship. the cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the navy seals think they have everything under control but they don't know what they're dealing with and they all end up dead, a girl jumps into the "movie sexpot" role as rhys-davies' daughter and the creature mauls about 100 or so shipmates. what this movie has going for it is, it's very fast-paced and lively; you're never bored or waiting for another kill. other than that, though, it does nothing to distinguish itself, and it's silly that this thing crawls all over the ceilings and can't be wounded by navy seal machine guns, but can be karate-kicked into submission by rhys-davies' daughter. kinda went back and forth on giving this bad boy a 5, but for the above silliness i'm giving it a 4.

in general, i prefer horror movies that creep me out so much i'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. this is one of those movies. the chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. as in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend. it not only attacks humans, but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof, nearly indestructible constitution. so tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't? and why, when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it, do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? john rhys-davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie, and chelan simmons and dylan neal deserve credit for their performances, too. otherwise, the rest of the acting was poor to bad, just like the rest of the movie. my rating is based on rhys-davies, simmons and neal.

well, the sci-fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time. when normally good actors like john rhys-davies and giancarlo espositto come off as rank amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the rest of the cast in this waste-of-your-time effort is. the only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature(which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is). the dialogue...the plot...if this "movie"(and i use the term loosely) was food, jack-in-the-box would be a gourmet meal compared to this. watch a re-run of "the munsters" for the 372nd viewing- your time would be better spent(and a lot scarier as well)!

chupacabra: dark waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. i had expected at least some passable entertainment because john rhys davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, i can honestly say i lowered my opinion of mr. davies substantially.why? the acting is incredibly poor. an excellent actor like davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. it was painfully obvious that mr. davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. to say that he just showed up would be an understatement. but at least he did show up. the rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various los angeles restaurants where they work as waiters. talk about a cast of unknowns! this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. they act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office.what about the special effects? store bought firecrackers, styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and cgi effects that look like they came from my 1980 atari game. i have seen some horrible special effects used on sci-fi channel movies, but this stuff looked like cut-and-paste done at the kindergarten by someones' child. i expected mr. crabs and sponge-bob would show up at the end to battle the chupacabra. not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin-like critter. it would have been a good film for a leprechaun-like character. instead, we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stop-action speeded-up effects that are laughable. the chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at super-speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this.

dr. pena (giancarlo esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare - read: nonexistent - animals) and his crew of hunters manage to trap a chupacabra, a big, scaly, elusive fast-moving beast. to get it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a grecian cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to. i guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either. the monster then does the monster thang; running around biting chunks out of various passengers until the ship's captain (john rhys-davies), a square-jawed special agent pretending to be an insurance salesman for some reason (dylan neal), a squeaky-voiced blonde tai bo instructor (chelan simmons), a bunch of guys with machine guns and others try to stop it. the main victims (who i think are supposed to be the comic relief but it's hard to tell) are an old rich bitch (paula shaw) with a yippy terrier and a snobby effete gold-digger (david millbern). apparently the monster can be knocked out with a single tranquilizer dart, but can live through dozens of bullet hits. the chupacabra design is acceptable (though unoriginal) but the rest of the movie is devoid of suspense, surprise or interest. a boring sci-fi channel "original" movie; they've made dozens of movies just like this with nearly interchangeable characters and plots, but with slight alterations on the creature. enough already!

first, and foremost, i take issue to the title of this movie. 'chupacabra' is not a spanish word. the name to which they are referring is 'chupacabras'. i imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but i assure you, it is singular in spanish.next, i thought this movie had been done years ago. it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. then it would have been kind of scary.let's talk about the special effects. the most important 'effect' is the costume used for the chupacabras. given that it is the main character, you would think some serious money would have been put into it, but that isn't so. the shape, color, and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney world.there were times when the chupacabras was walking where no man could walk. his movement were jerky and strange at these times, but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man.another thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it. the chupacrabas would kill one, then the next, but it never seemed to actually eat the victim. you say, "it's just a movie," and i agree. but the idea is so far out there that it's stupid.what country is dr. pena from? he sounds sort of jamaincan/hawaiian/british/something-else, but i think he's supposed to be latino. the problem is, his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he wasn't latino.the soldiers fired round after round at this thing, and weren't making a dent, yet the continued to fire. i'm no military man, but don't soldiers, especially the special tactical forces such as this, have to have some wit about them to perform their duties? wouldn't they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? they didn't. they just kept firing away while the chupacabras continued to slaughter, and not eat, them.did they have to kill the little dog? :) anyway, my vote was 3 for this flick, because it was bad. why did i watch the whole thing? i'm sure you've done the same on occasion, so don't give me an flack. ;)

a cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a caribbean island.to get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous results.lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie.... the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.the cgi scenes looked like a different movie. ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b movie.the best thing was john rhys-davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.)john was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say, he said it well.good job given what he had to work with.the cyptozoologist was over the top and fun to watch too,he had some funny bits.the marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and guests.there are a few pretty funny lines in this movie,and a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thief.the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie. i did like the gore of the legless man.really since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this movie.all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit.

michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u.s army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner, which is hampered by too many long pauses without action, but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james' performance.

i couldn't stop laughing, i caught this again on late night tv. "i suppose you think you're some kind of hero for bringing my daughter back alive" "no" "good"haha.

this review contains a spoiler---the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts. he falls for the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the "people's hero" at the end of the film. this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched. it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality. good for kids under 14. the military errors in this film is comical. i remember during my three years in the military, us privates were not required to salute or call nco's "sir", the film does this in various spots. the colonel's hair is way too long on the ears. the master sergent's moustache was against military protocol in length. on the post, the colonel was the only officer around. not one other officer was shown walking around the post. you had idiot ninjas brandshing swords against troops with m-16's, rather poorly made.folks this filmed reeked. michael dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts. the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. avoid this film

i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. living in taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in america. i have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. i seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. how sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what i thought should have been titled "generic ninja fight scene, op. 1" or "variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girl's head when backed into a corner" or the daring "flight of the helicopter". then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled. those actually had me in tears laughing. if the "special effects" weren't proof enough that this was low-budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably locals which although good for the much-needed phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money, have ever done anything since this series of movies. they rented equipment, despite making sequels to this movie. that was pretty funny too. the thing that really had me going though, was not the music (which left me half expecting an animated sargeant slaughter from g.i. joe to pop up), but the ending...i suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil, but when the american ninja drops the girl into jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch him.i think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.

*hannibal spoilers* hannibal lecter (anthony hopkins) is back... for a travesty of a movie! now he's in italy, appreciating our food (including people, such as rinaldo pazzi (giancarlo giannini)), but comes back to the states for clarice (julianne moore) and to even the score with a former victim, mason verger (gary oldman).let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the lambs and manhunter, because it's truly, completely, absolutely, totally bad.i mean, the scene near the end with ray liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain sautéed? wtf? then, why the hell was everybody so annoying (including clarice)? and why did the story keep going nowhere? i suppose that this is the 'teen' chapter of the hannibal series; terrible, stupid, gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing.don't watch it, especially if you love any other of the hannibal movies (sotl, manhunter, red dragon, hannibal rising).hannibal: 1/10.

hannibal must be the most god-awful movie i have seen in a long time. in fact, i want my money back. what a waste of time. no plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. what else can i say? if you haven't seen it don't bother. i wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv... change the channel. the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it). if you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.what was the purpose of this movie? its like someone just asked 'i wonder what hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. he is free in the beginning and he's free at the end. in between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers. julianne moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as i'm concerned she was set up to fail.in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.i give it a big fat raspberry!

synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed silence of the lambs, hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad sfx. why so many people in this forum are claiming that h is "not all bad" and "worth watching on the big screen", etc., is beyond me; and it is not "so bad it's good" either, it is just plain boring. i normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case i have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from shine - ola. maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a ridley scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous ac fans. h is totally devoid of suspense; instead we get endless scenes of lecter swanning through an english - speaking firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing h, i actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when i wrote them down i quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop). rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, i would advise you to wait until it comes on tv in a couple of years; and then to go to bed early.1 / 10.below are a couple of extra bones i have to pick with hannibal:- h _is_ the sequel to sotl, despite what some people in this forum are claiming. and even though sotl was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (sotl itself was the sequel to michael mann's "manhunter", based on thomas harris' "red dragon", and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, sotl was even better; another example would be the alien series initiated by h's director ridley scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels). in any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.- this movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as sotl, the cast is strictly a - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church. so what went wrong? i think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, dino delaurentiis. here is my interpretation: ddl produced "manhunter", which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop. disappointed, he gave the rights for the hannibal lecter character to orion -- for free, allowing jonathan demme to make sotl, and the rest is cinema history. ddl then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until thomas harris finally came up with the sequel novel. i think at this point ddl had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.- another aspect that i find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media; i mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity. and while most reviewers harp on about how dantesque the scenes in firenze are and why jodie foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is an utter, utter, utter flop goes unmentioned. but there is more: not only is hannibal being hyped through the roof, it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of "documentaries" (usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of sotl) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling. however, not only does h not even pretend to be realistic; lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help clarice starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know hl, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: lecter feeds the drugged - up paul krendler his own brain, so that makes it (erm) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism. try making a documentary out of that.- much has been said about the acting: mainly whether julianne moore can replace jodie foster, and anthony hopkins (who plays the lead hannibal lecter) is usually given a lot of praise. i think all of these discussions are moot. there are several of my favourite actors in this movie (namely liotta, oldman and moore) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with. same for hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way. and by the way, he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies, only that in h he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 million to do it.

i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. in the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. hannibal was not an exception. i wasn't expecting much, when i went in to see the movie. the book was ridiculous, and the saying, "the book is always better than the movie" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. but what i came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison. usually, when i see a terrible movie, i find myself more amused than anything else. sadly though, i could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that hannibal is. the movie was filmed with promise, i guess. it had anthony hopkins, julianne moore, and gary oldman. and for directing, there was ridley scott. there have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. there was so much i would have cut from this film that i doubt anything would have remained. it was pathetic. the storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. what's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where***spoiler ahead*** ray liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. that scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. silence of the lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. but hannibal was a two hour plus joke. this movie should only be watched, if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.

hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). minor spoilers follow...this movie has huge logic holes - more than any bruckheimer/bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of hollywood exaggeration. it's a slick hollywood production designed to cash in on hannibal lector mania, directed by "so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously" hack director ridley scott and produced by a hack italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is "doesn't matter whether film is s**t, money is good".i can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters david mamet and steven zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author thomas harris. david and steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. another factor in the disappointment of this film.there are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. starling/pazzi cell-phone in the midst of lecter pursuit that turns up inspector pazzi as the victim. not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by tony hopkins with a smirk and julianne moore, ray liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face. hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" along with hammy acting by gary oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against lecter.the gore effect is good, but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from hannibal. the predecessor - silence of the lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. suspense is what made silence of the lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tensely directed. the "brain dinner" sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.the ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you? ooh, scary... 

a typical old b&w film. the dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second half - they get naive, sometimes awfully naive, occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical. the first third, with its background information on ladd's gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the movie. but once gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on betty field, the film gets overly melodramatic. the ending is yet another cop-out ending; i don't know whether the novel itself contains this dumb, clichéd ending or whether the movie's producer made some changes to it, but i've always considered car-accidents to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. i've seen this plot-device a million times (or if it's not a car, then it's a fall from a horse); the writer doesn't know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic, so he adds in a car-accident. lame. and to make things worse, the accident is outrageously coincidental and preposterous, both plot-wise and time-wise; plot-wise because field's husband's mistress (winters) gets killed by field, and the fact that winters sort of rushes out from the gas-station into the street as though she'd never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house - and, of course, at the very moment that she comes out she sees ladd's car and mistakes it for field's husband's car and then shouts "over here! i'm here! run me over and make the ending tragic that way!"; time-wise because ladd and field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell field's husband about their affair. basically, there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. it also doesn't exactly help this movie how winters's husband, da silva, goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife; he basically does this by walking around like a zombie, going from car to car looking for scratches, and acting very badly indeed. both da silva's acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing, respectively.scott fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by hollywood's screenwriters, and - although he was dead long before this movie was done - he might have been right to complain, judging by this film's naive script. or, maybe his novels are even sillier and more naive than this film, and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations. or, the films are pretty much like the novels. i could, of course, read this particular novel to find out, but i just can't be bothered. fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and i don't mean the way his name sounds.) he was certainly no heller, clavell, or twain. more like hemingway  a lot of noise about nothing.

leslie nielson is a very talented actor, who made a huge mistake by doing this film. it doesn't even come close to being funny. the best word to describe it is stupid!

do not see "mr. magoo." it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. leslie nielson was not funny in it. he has not been funny since the naked gun movies. well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a naked gun movie! the movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. nothing in the entire movie was funny. the first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old magoo cartoons. i wish the movie would have stayed that way.

i know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but i am going to anyway! i waited for a laugh, i tried to give it time. i think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. my laugh never came, so i gave up.it's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. it isn't anywhere near that high grade. let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. they may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't. i suppose, if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experience.a very pathetic effort.

i enjoyed the mr. magoo cartoons i saw while growing up. and i enjoy leslie nielson's comic skills. so, i thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.i couldn't have been more wrong.this movie was just awful. i don't recall a single funny moment. this is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) i've wanted my money back. you will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. in a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags. this plot does neither. it just kinda lies there, gasping like a beached fish.

horrible horrible movie, i still can't believe my friend talked me into seeing this! no plot, bad acting, unfunny scenes, and very very stupid dialogue. all i have to say is that this movie is the worst movie i have seen and it's worse than halloween iii which i gave 0 stars too. so i give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well on here a 1, but you get the point.

this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in. this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny. he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. the movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated. if the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it, and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on. on a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a score of -100.

after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. a sick film that was not funny and was not worth the money, any money at all. if anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. so if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. i beg of you, don't!

only one word can describe mr magoo - slapstick. unfortunately this isn't no airplane. looks can decieve, and that's exactly what mr magoo does. based on the old cartoon, leslie nielson plays magoo, a bumbling near blind man whop stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. now he must hunt them down using...blindness basically. and that's all this film plays off. the blindness of mr magoo. now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this, but pretty much it's just one of those " droopy dumb grin on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you payed to see this" films. but mr magoo isn't as bad as it's hacked up to be. it's at least got some funny jokes, and it's good wholesome fun for the whole family (nielson tried to make a "naked gun" for families in magoo, but it's no where near as good as that). so see it once, you might hate it, you might love it, whatever. i personally didn't hate it, but i sure didn't like it, or even rate it "okay." 2/5 stars for mr magoo-john ulmer

i left the theater, and i was only 10 years old. that's how bad it sucked. the plot was horrid and the acting was worse. leslie nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. i was only 10 years old when i went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age i did not laugh once at the movie. we (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. we ended up going into the 'r' movie my parents were in. bottom line -- this flick was fricking bad. mr. magoo -- more like mr. ma-who? this movie could have scarred me for life had i watched the popular cartoon on television as a child but luckily i had never seen it, so i was spared the agony but i will never get back those precious minutes of my life that i wasted.

this movie had terrible acting, terrible plot, and terrible choice of actors. (leslie nielsen...come on!!!) the one part i considered slightly funny was the battling fbi/cia agents, but because the audience was mainly kids they didn't understand that theme.

this morning, i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. i found myself thinking, "oh yeah, there was a mr. magoo movie, wasn't there?" this is more surprising because i remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). i even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because i am a fan of both mr. magoo, and mr. nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play mr. magoo. i even remember the opening animated credits, because i thought that they were pretty amusing.after that, though, its all a complete blank. i think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember anything from it. i understand that leslie nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but i saw him in "spy hard," in "scary movie 4," and "police squad 3" and none of these were great movies, but i came away at least remembering *something*. mr. magoo, though, is a complete blank.i find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.

leslie nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen. there is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn't all that funny. how many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? that's not funny, that's just pitiful. nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and stanley tong needs to stick to making jackie chan films, because it doesn't get much worse than this.

give director stanley tong of jackie chan's super cop and rumble in the bronx, and what do you get? you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo-like madness.the limited plot has magoo (leslie nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. of course he has no idea what he is doing. in fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken. you will wish that you were as nearsighted as magoo. its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster! you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies. this isn't his best, but he does a good job playing magoo. i thought it was a funny film, and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny.

leslie nielsen is usually someone whose movies i really like (even critically panned flicks like "dracula: dead and loving it" and "wrongfully accused"). so the fact that i'm slamming "mr. magoo" should show that it's a piece of junk. it casts nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. it seems like the combo of nielsen and director stanley tong (behind two of jackie chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor here.so, the original cartoon with jim backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. leslie nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. also starring kelly lynch, stephen tobolowsky, ernie hudson, malcolm mcdowell and miguel ferrer; they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.

i saw this with my with my kids they love it but i don't she did not get run overfed by a reindeer in the song, but what the heck in this crappy movie she got hit by the sleigh, it's like what the heck why why, when my kids heard the sinked they thought it was good but we they watched this they were like this "daddy why did granny" thats how my kids say grandma, any way my kids said this "daddy why did grandma get hit by a sleigh" i told them that the movie was crappy they agreed, it's sad why would any one name there dog "doofas" that's just dumb & when every one dressed in black that looked so so i mean daphne looked like a dang emo goth girl every one looked like goths & in the song they found grandma on the ground i think she died in the song, but in this weird crappy movie she was gone i think they should take this show off ok every one would love this i give this a 1 out of 10

lame, ridiculous and absurd. my 6 year old son talked us into watching this rubbish. tripe stereotypes and themes not appropriate for children. the antithesis of the commercialism of christmas is not socialism it's jesus.

this is supposedly a story in which a grown man tells a story about his youth. yet, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc, which are items used in the late 20th century and early 21st. so when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020. gee, i wonder how advanced we are then. how about telling us that.also, there are several legal issues which also make no sense. in the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country. also, grandma would have to be missing at least seven years in most states before to be declared officially dead.congratulations elmo shropshire. you are now officially a sellout.

any of law & order's, csi (take your choice of city), and homicide: life on the street's weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of bones.david boreanaz is stuck in crappy angel mode, and emily deschanel portrays "bones" too... unrealistically. the actors as a whole have terrible scenes together, be it with forced acting, or just awful lines.the murders become predictable after a while, as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious.music is okay, though really unnecessary at times.all in all, bones is hardly the show i'd recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon-copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever-dulling stories.skip this if you can.

one chinese gang attacks and wipes out another gang in the beginning of the film. unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. oddly, and without any discernible reason, the gang solicits a volunteer to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me, so sending this one guy away just seemed silly, but that's the plot. later, when this man comes home, betrayals and scheming have occurred--leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop killing.if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot, then you should probably skip this movie, as its practically non-stop action and practically no plot or character development--even when compared to other martial arts films. i would estimate that 80-90% of the film are fight scenes--endless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives. again and again and again, fight scenes! if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are slashed, kicked, and slashed, then this is the film for you. the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest!! deep it ain't, but if you want to see excitement and action only, then this film is for you! by the way, this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end. and, when they finally do the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is really, really lame! logical errors like this and the lady's suicide (why???) make this a "turn off your brain" type of film.

incident on and off a mountain road is don coscarelli's entry in mick garris' masters of horror series. coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the phantasm series and the irresistibly weird bubba ho-tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this tv episode. the plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. this time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. after a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac. the whole chase sequence is really ridiculous, with the young lady stopping every so often to set traps; only for the maniac to show up seconds later, and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband - who just happens to have a wealth of information on how escape insane killers; with lines such as "expect the unexpected". the only real highlight for me was the presence of phantasm's tall man, angus scrimm. coscarelli tries his best to implement as much horror imagery as possible; with things such as a rotted corpse of a dead baby - but because it's all so silly on the whole, it's difficult to take this piece seriously. this is the first episode in the series, and the first that i've seen; i really hope they get better.

"you can survive anything". anything except a dumb horror flick. the director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. you can't have both. it's like michael moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of "docu-comedies": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. some genres cannot be mixed."anything can happen to anyone, any time, any place." (translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) this sounds not so much like something "wise" found on a paper of a chinese fortune cookie, but more like the credo of every bad horror film director. we get this baloney of a statement served to us early on, sort of as a preparation/justification of the absurd buffoonery to come."my phone isn't working!" well, of course it isn't. there is a far greater chance that sean penn's brain starts working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than that a horror-film cell-phone does. the single most dreary and predictable horror cliché of the past decade. why even say it? we know help will never come via a phone-call, so ye horror-making dimwits might as well just not even mention it. the last 50 horror films i saw use this plot device. it's becoming embarrassing."you always have to expect the unexpected." the final twist was rather surprising, i'll give them that much... however, plenty of nonsense on the way there.check out the elaborate traps the heroine sets up with the speed of a drugged-up lab rat - in the cold, wet, and almost totally dark conditions. i just love horror-film realism...when a blood-thirsty demon starts trying to be funny (by "shshshing" his victims) then you know your horror-viewing pleasure is in doubt. the less said about the old geezer "cracking wise", the better... another stupid cliché served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director.what are the odds of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye-hating demon - on the same day? "expect the unexpected". they might as well have squeezed in an event in which she survives a plane crash, and then another in which she encounters aliens who tried to anal-probe her...the fast-forward button needs a temple or a shrine built in its image.

"mararía" really disappointed me. i can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. dr. fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. i mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with mararía?? maybe once? also, mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, that of marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the canary islands, and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.

i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating. this was a big disappointment. this doesn't hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the dead,day of the dead, land of the dead etc. horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going, you have to build up the characters so when they snuff it,you feel some empathy etc but even so, there's a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse, up to that point,its like watching a bad soap opera, nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first time,you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes, you won't miss anything plot- wise. when things do get going, its all very sub-par stuff. some of the kills and make up are done well, others are done very poorly, consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting i've ever seen.this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired, firebombs being let off,no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air, c'mon, we're not all simpletons.oh, and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jet's missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away. i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility. one to miss.

i never really thought about watching this film. i kept seeing it perched on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental shop and never thought much about it. just your run of the mill, bland zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene. nothing special, might as well watch python...oh no wait, that's a terrible film.i only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on tv and said it was an awful piece of trash. so, i decided to verify these tales, and only then did i realise how terrible the film hiding behind the bland and uninteresting dvd box cover was.not that the idea is bad in itself. a plane is a confined area, and would be a real death trap for the people on board should zombies make their appearance...a good premise for a zombie film. but this film took a good setting and crapped all over it with poor acting, unsteady camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score.the characters all have different levels of hatefulness. there are two young couples who are basically friends going on a vacation in france. one couple is composed of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who is having an affair with mr jock's best friend, who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho. there is also a policeman escorting a con-man (an effeminate and highly annoying con-man). the policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters of the lot. then there is a bunch of air hostesses who mostly end up as zombie chow...no i didn't watch the whole film, it was just too painful an experience to carry through, almost as bad as watching cannibal holocaust. oh and there's also a golfer on holiday with his wife, some strange air marshal who really does not appear to be important until he's summoned to help deal with the zombie escapees, a trio of scientists who all fall victim to the undead and a couple of pilots. the camera work is often shaky, and although many people don't seem to mind, it can really get on your nerves after a while, like having a small fly buzz constantly around your head. it's small but it's there and it's annoying.the adulterous couple are genuinely annoying. all they do is have sex in the plane's toilets while their spouses aren't looking...in fact all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying. they whine, bitch, argue and have some of the most inane and mind-buggeringly boring dialogue in the movie...yes, it makes you glad to see them die.the score is atrocious. it is so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of suspense a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. in fact, it sounds like the score from...python! that film will never stop haunting me.there is also a character that the film makers seemed incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible. a nun, sitting near the young adults and clutching her bible who is included in so many shots you start to wonder if she plays any major part in the film...but no she doesn't, so why have her in so many scenes? was it because the film's creator's original project was a nun porn flick? nobody will ever know.the zombies look pretty good. their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters, they are far more convincing and likable! the guard responsible for keeping an eye on the scientist's illegal cargo was quite funny. a large crate appears to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some kind of sharp object...yet he doesn't scream, wince or moan in pain. he just grunts and squirms in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg...in fact he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain.ah well, all in all i give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies.watch this movie only if you like young adults bickering and throwing things at each other, and sadly, there really isn't anything funny about the whole thing so watching for a laugh would probably fail, unless you're high on some kind of psychoactive drug.

this review contains spoilers.i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead. i already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of snakes on a plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so i figured i didn't really have much to lose.the music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although i did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie. it started off surprisingly well, the opening scenes weren't too bad, some of the acting was a little cringe-worthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would be.it all goes well until laura cayouette (rocket from kill bill: vol. 2) enters the picture. she is supposed to be playing a scientist. if she is, she's not a very bright one. luckily she's polished off pretty quickly.i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the plane during some turbulence. there was a nun. have you ever been on a plane with a nun!? i was surprised she wasn't clutching a crucifix.finally, after 35 minutes, we get to some zombie action, and use the word 'action' loosely. the special effects are pretty below standard, but that's to be expected from a movie with this budget. being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie though, it makes you look pretty amusing. using slow motion doesn't work particularly well either. i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story. trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" wasn't an especially good move either considering malaria isn't a virus.the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie. most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive. possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly inconceivable ending. i know it's a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living, but the ending was just ridiculous. rating: ★★

if you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. it fails at the first post by not being scary or funny. it is a dull grey movie that i guess went straight to video. hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. if you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch diary of the dead. poor special effects, school level script. zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . this movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores. this is as thrilling and convincing as a republican convention, no sorry watching the republican convention would be a better example of a zombie movie.

i'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. this movie focused more on a "let's just make it gory" view.the movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. i wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively. and the original zombie lady, kelly or something, displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick. i laughed quite hard when she died. deserved it in every way.i was a little confused as to why dr. kelly could talk after becoming a zombie, but then there wasn't anything uttered by another zombie because annoying screams and shrieks. and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen, yet when dr. bennett is expelled from the airplane and into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live at the end.i kinda felt that they altered things to make a "good" scene. when one of the bitchy girlfriends (i didn't take the time to learn their names. they played a pointless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. was it a two-way mirror to watch mile-high clubbers? i've never broken a mirror on an airplane (bad luck and all that) but i doubt there is that much room behind there, with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and all.the few redeeming qualities were too little too late, sadly. one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight attendants, yet they felt the need to kill all but one off. and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady chomps down on frank's arm and he says "she's gumming me to death" or something to that degree.honestly, i'm sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie. the fact that i bought it underage kinda redeems that but still... it failed on so many levels. stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later.

this movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie. there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks. for instance, there were like 50 people on the plane, they killed like 100 and they kept coming, apparently the "virus" gives hepatic complications because everybody had yellow eyes, also the virus makes people roar like lions or something, and the virus not only regenerates tissue as it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes up peoples hair. it's also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only happens on planes) that person is kicked back in the air. remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and you loose him, always look inside the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle, you never know where those bastards are going to hide. and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (happens all the time), after watching dozens of people being killed, just walk away from the plane, watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant. :)

..."flight of the living dead" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director scott "i'm a producer, can'tcha tell?" thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because i feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-dvd release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like richard "three o'clock high" tyson, erick "stargate" avari, and raymond j. "little children" barry, and a slew of others not so recognizable, "fold" is predominantly populated with cardboard, most of which ends up soaked in unconvincing fake blood. there are a few (precious few) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie trapped in his seat both come to mind), but most of the scripting is pedestrian and comic-book stupid, and i am here to assure you that we're talking pedestrian and stupid. you'll never for a second believe that "fold" is anything but a cheap cash-in movie with pretensions of cool. god forbid it ever spawn the sequel its idiotic ending promises.strictly freebie viewing, depending on how impecunious your local library is, and otherwise suitable for insomniacs and the indiscriminate only.

i don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. i'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. really, actually, i should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. production is... well, okay. barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clichés, and an abrupt ending. go ahead and like zombie movies, but don't ever give this above a 5.0. honestly though, the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh. seriously.

it's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. the paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. case in point: flight of the living dead (or, as i quickly came to know it, shite of the living dead). there's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes. i've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways. in fact, in the xlibris book the night riders, co-written with m. kelley, i dedicate it, in part, to "the six writers whose work inspires me still: richard matheson, harlan ellison, shirley jackson, edgar allen poe, h.p. lovecraft, and robert e. howard." had it been a motion picture, i would've dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years. very high up on that list would've been george romero. it's nothing less than a crying shame that the makers of this film weren't truly as inspired by romero as their title suggests.

this has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. the plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. the "special effects" ( spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. i have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end. the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me.. i'm sorry for my bad english.. i am from romania ( and this is my first post ). i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just can't believe that this is a movie released in 2007.

an obvious cash-in on the *insert monster here* on a plane gimmick, flight of the living dead is about what you'd expect it to be. the film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. although, it is fun in parts, i must say. the zombie-action is particularly entertaining. once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.the practical special effects are pretty good, but the cgi is terrible and distracting. the ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel. let's hope that doesn't come to fruition. if you're a die-hard fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror films, i'd recommend it to you; it's worth at least one watch. however, if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. 3/10

this movie is so over-the-top as to be a borderline comedy. laws of physics are broken. things explode for no good reason. great movie to sit down with a six-pack and enjoy. do not - i repeat do not see this movie sober. you will die horrible death!!!

not much to say other than plenty of wire-fu and supposed sholin monks ego-tripping about kung-fu and caricature japanese plotting to take over china. all of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake japanese sword fighting. if you watched a samurai movie or two you can tell that the "japanese" fighting in the movie is simply the same "kung-fu" (really circus acrobats) stunt men doing the same things except with a japanese sword. however, there are a couple of fun moments such as when a japanese woman ninja tears off her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net. storywise, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as whether the japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions. the "japanese" protagonist is shown as largely honourable but not beyond unwarranted cruelty such as when he murders a sedated monk so that he may have his duel. quite disappointing with a very silly ending. does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle.

i actually liked certain things about this game. i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. the graphics really weren't bad, but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. the music was fine. the things i hated were: the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. the inability to save was awful!!! some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. i thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. this game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. play it at your own risk.

this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen. the visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent black and white to color switch. i also thought that the story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clichéd action movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. i could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? i can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do. over all truly the worst i have ever seen, you thought disney was bad? i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing because i'm sure i could guess the outcome, and the visual were the worst i have ever seen.

if you thought nbc's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that fx reached into the bowels of made-for-tv hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. the filming style was the now overused "docu-action" look, complete with cuts to grainy b&w "rawcore" footage. i'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the dp said to the director before filming. i don't know what they were going for here but it reminded me of the guy at the office who thinks powerpoint presentations with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool."the story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in southern ca. that's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there's security precautions up the ying-yang. for the sake of reality, they put 2 off-duty chippies in the mix. because, they'd be able to stop 6 people, right? six. i mean, even bruce willis had to deal with more terrorists over at that stupid nakatomi building.leslie hope (tv's teri bauer) plays a chp officer who has problems talking on the phone after she's shot in her bullet-proof vest. her voice sounds like a sally struther's tv ad, whiny and monotonous. her character is only a plot device, and after she performs her one small duty, she is promptly disposed of. yes, teri bauer is died! bruce greenwood stars as fbi s.a.c. tom shea, who continually points out how he punches foreign diplomats in the face. his boss is out, so nobody over at the dept. of homeland security believes his prognosis of the situation. he's the sensible one out of a group of paranoid public officials afraid of taking blame for any type of catastrophe. he's calm, he's strong, he's boring.there is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about meltdown - ok, well maybe teri bauer getting died was pretty unnecessary and funny - other than that, nothing redeeming.

director jeremiah checheck who brought us big budget debacles like "the avengers" and the remake of "diabolique" has directed this ripoff of the die hard concept, done on - what looks like - a blair witch budget. a california nuclear reactor is overtaken by arab terrorists. but - are you ready? - the terrorists aren't arab; they're really disgruntled american soldiers masquerading as arabs! we find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. we're not sure what the statement is but never mind. so there's really no threat. but then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow up the plant because he's kind of crazy. so maybe there is a threat after all. but the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed. so there was no threat. oh, and a good guy is killed too. let that be a lesson to everybody.if all of this sounds muddled and kinda of a waste of time then you got the idea of what watching meltdown is all about.the script never bothers to introduce the characters or to even give any personal details that might flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience. so we're left with one dimensional characters: the-expert-that-nobody-will-listen-to; the-trigger-happy-sergeant; the-slimy-politicians; the-dweeby-engineers. the story skips from one cliché incident to the next in a formula composite of practically every action movie you've ever seen. but at nearly every turn, just when we think something may be at stake the script flinches and we find out there's actually nothing to worry about.like die hard, there's an police officer who's on the inside, unbenownst to the bad guys. the big twist is that the cop here is....a woman! oh and she's injured too. but not that bad, just enough to make her wince a couple times. oh and instead of the walkie talkie that bruce willis had this cop has a magic cell phone that works everywhere...even underground! when he's not yelling at everybody else bruce greenwood - his jaw made out of granite - tries to soothe her over the walkie talkie. he even makes a joke once but we're afraid his face might crack. after all, this is serious business.but mostly it's scene after scene of people arguing: the military expert is arguing to wait it out (his reasoning doesn't seem particularly sound but he's supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people at the white house argue with him; the army sergeant argues with him too; the nice pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist. the dialogue is absolutely b movie all the way and lines like, "stop the broadcast! stop the broadcast!!!" may have you in rolling off your sofa as you wonder if the characters are actually referring to this silliness.maybe to compensate for the lack of production quality the camera-work is kept jittery in that faux documentary 21 grams style that's supposed to lend immediacy and energy to the scenes but the way it's indiscriminately and amateurishly applied here it's downright annoying; even pretentious. further attempts to ratchet up the tempo are made with the inclusion of nonsensical black and white footage that's randomly intercut with the main action. but this, too, is pretentious and annoying in that blair witch kinda way. in short, the stylistic attempts look very amateurish.the music lives up to the visuals - it's synthy and cheap sounding. sort of like a porn movie but with less melody and lots more heart beat sounds. the graphic treatment is howlingly bad too: cheesy graphics in huge red font scream out to us "9:28 pm" as though the timeclock actually makes some kind of difference.meltdown may work as a marketing concept but it's clear that the script was a second thought. fx - part of fox - put this cheesy production together and dropped several million dollars on it. now that's what i call a meltdown!

while not as bad as some movies (like the horrible "atomic twister"), "meltdown" still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. i am currently studying nuclear engineering in the pursuit of a masters degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry.riding the false fear that a chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an american plant, the movie states that any meltdown (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the movie) would mean disaster for the area. in fact, a partial meltdown in an american plant, while destroying the core, would not pose any risk to the surrounding area. three mile island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released into the environment at all, thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and core design used in this country paired with substantial containment. the security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie furthest from the truth. at any important strategic location -- be it power plant, chemical plant, military base, anything -- you will never see personnel responding to an alarm by milling around talking as if it were an unannounced drill. this is especially true at a nuclear plant, where, upon the sounding of the alarm, the reactors would be scramed immediately, shutting them off. scraming can be done with the push of a button in the control room (you do not need to put the core in "shutdown mode" like depicted in the movie), and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being brought back up to power within about 9 hours of a scram. so if this scenario played out in real life, the assailants would not be able to cause a significant meltdown. in theory, they could still cause a partial one due to residual heat if they exposed the core immediately, but that would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant -- there are many more than the single backup pumps they speak of in the movie.as for the spent fuel pools, it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up, but this is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. the fuel is under (approximately) 18 feet of highly purified water. the water cannot become radioactive (no radioactive steam like they speak of in the movie). particles dissolved in water can, but the water itself cannot; thus the reason for very thorough purification. so the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. this is no easy task as water is very heavy, and the pools are below ground with very thick concrete walls. the explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel (which is securely fastened). and there would have to be a heck of a lot of explosives, as water is *very* hard to move through an explosion. even if this were to occur, spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death toll as mentioned in the movie, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread.  from a basic movie standpoint, i grew somewhat tired of the style used. the constant fading in and out, use of gritty black and white, and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish. the characters were one-dimensional, especially those in the us government. i have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie, but will not discuss it as it would be a major spoiler.overall, 3/10

this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch. i just don't like that so-called "realistic" camera work that is being done nowadays; you know the type- jumping off center, panning around, etc. what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene. i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead. maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint.

i gave it a rating of 3 out of 10.and what's sad is, i made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so i wouldn't miss seeing it. i wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, barbara wilson. as a lesbian, i expected to love this film.i don't know how ms. wilson felt about the film, but i found it a major disappointment.it should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - set in spain, and the main character, cassandra, is a language translator who gets contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers cassandra a great deal of money to locate her ex-husband, ben.there are secrets galore revealed, but for some reason it just didn't matter. it was like, oh, so what. i could not get involved with these characters or come to care about them, or feel for them. i couldn't even identify with these characters.i think a large part of the film's failure was the actress playing the main character. she looked old, tired, worn out, and as dull as dishwater. her hair was a perpetual mess, her baggy clothes were boring, and she just was not appealing or interesting.the best part of the film was getting to hear a dean martin recording, but even that was ruined by the weird make-up worn by the man who was dancing and lip-synching to the song. believe me - it was nothing like getting to see the suavely handsome mr. martin performing it.the ending is so syrupy you'll wish you had some pancakes to go with the syrup.

whatever committee of pc enforcers is responsible for this movie has achieved something that i never thought possible: to take some truly gifted actors (davis, hardin and taylor) and make you want to insure you never encounter them in an enclosed space, ever. the sentiments that underlie the screenplay are so jejeune and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what audience would find this picture appealing, much less funny. architecture students perhaps?only one scene is visually clever: marcia gay hardin sashaying, all wriggles and rhythm, into a bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the whole of the rest of the film added up and multiplied to the tenth power. as for the other members of the cast, they probably won't want to put this one on their resumes.

some funny lines are all what makes this movie bearable. the camera tv-movie-like, the acting poor (julie davis is more than disapointing) and the directing amateurish and / or loveless. but i can understand that no one had fun to realise the overconstructed and trivial script.

comparing this movie to anything by almodovar is an insult to almodovar. the best thing i can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an almodovar movie and fails miserably. the script is dreadful, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of high-school drama (except marcia gay harden's, which is pretty good, given the material she has to work with). furthermore, the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of gaudi's architecture or the infectious charm of barcelona. if you enjoy the grit, pathos and dark, quirky comedy of almodovar's movies, you'll find none of them here. spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.

i was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. i like judy davis and juliette lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.unfortunately, i found myself dozing over and over again. judy davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. juliette lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. the plot was full of "twists" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act. and, personally, i thought marcia gay harden was totally miscast.the movie also seemed to shift about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. one reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different, and therefore decried it. all i can say is that i would have settled for the movie being *something* and sticking with it. this one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas but wasn't able to pull them all off. i give it a 4 out of 10.

in a farcical key, gaudí afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. marcia gay harden and judy davis pivoted a good cast (juliette lewis' new-age freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality, i know an american young lady who squawks like her!!) but ga does not show much beyond its overtoned plot.even though movie-making is all about make believe, there were certain noticeable screenplay inconsistencies. two samples: you pay 14 euro to enter the chapel where cassandra and frankie met, never at 7 am, and you cannot leave a terrace without paying the bill (they'll charge you on the spot if they don't know you) or get off a taxi that quickly (you americans always tip cabbies even though they don't expect to, but the sequences portrayed in the movie were ridiculous). don't believe me, reader: come over and see for yourself.if you've never been here before you might not care about all this, but good movies should be believable disregarding of your origin. nobody knows about ga here, and i will make sure that does not change in the future.

this movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. one of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.the good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about theresa chanthe bad :the main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman theresa chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. no linkage between the 3 story lines. minimum dialogue in the film, substituted by smss and chat programs on pc. no cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.

i literally ran to watch it, expecting a film that will make me cry, or touch my heart.what i found was not heart-rending, but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human character.interwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man.in a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common.it was not entirely bad, as i have seen worst - and i left the cinema $10 poorer but wiser - that a film well advertised is not the same as a film well-made.

'be with me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end. alas, as i watched it alone, and so i felt like i almost watched the world's worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and i then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a 'thank you' to the movie's sponsors - which included asia pacific breweries. aha! methought: how surprising is *that* - given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie? meanwhile, dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth, but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movie's overall story is said or witnessed. it's as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and you'd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency, or part of its plot, as far as the movie's overall progression was concerned. thus the ultimate "wallpaper movie"!well i wonder... what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching? i wonder and continue to wonder... it certainly couldn't have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a camera's rolling. allegedly, 'be with me' is supposed to be woven around the themes of "love, tragedy and redemption". but all i witnessed was boredom, a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages, and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended. what a wistful waste of time, it ended up being! it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a "remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities..." well, no disrespect to ms chan, but given that she was such a marvellous & amazing character, why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together? yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling. rather than tying in the fates of all characters, i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concerned.i am generally an art-house movie fan and don't usually object to slow pacing (of which here there is no shortage, believe you me!!). i hate such movies as 300, transformers, fight club, but consider, e.g., eric rohmer as a great film maker. so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective. nonetheless, there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movie's conception and delivery which could prevent one's eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of 'be with me' dripped by. watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time. otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it. 3/10

when i saw this movie three years ago, i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore art-house movies: slow-moving, with a minimal of plot and dialogue, depending on film composition to make it work.during then, amongst local cineastes, the inability to appreciate "be with me" is tantamount to panning "citizen kane" or any of ozu's late films. i've no idea how "be with me" reached such hallowed heights in singapore's cinematic consciousness, but i always felt that khoo's "12 storeys" is a better film, even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan, khoo's dp for "be with me". "12 storeys" has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too, something that "be with me"'s threadbare wistfulness doesn't have."be with me" is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by khoo and his screenwriter wong kim hoh. it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of deaf-and-blind teresa chan."be with me" is very well filmed by tan, using a varicam camera. the film compositions are masterful. the film, almost entirely silent, has next to no dialogue. characters move around, not in a realistic manner, but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director, almost always looking into the screen and emoting: either loneliness or sadness. unfortunately the characters don't act against each other. this kind of film has been seen before many times: in tsai ming-liang's films, in khoo's protégé royston tan's "4:30" and elsewhere. sadly, its ultra-slowness (essentially plot less) and use of a lento piano soundtrack simply doesn't appeal to me.to criticize "be with me" seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it, that of teresa chan, who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this, yet i'm afraid this film doesn't do anything much to me. i'm willing to applaud chan's steadfast and courageous march in life and tan's striking cinematography, but for a better take on the same subject-matter with more meat (without the two other tedious and distracting subplots), try werner herzog's "land of silence and darkness" (1971).

i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. the film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. the acting was absolutely dreadful. the children were overly whiny. a metal pole could have done a better job. i wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, i was kept from peace. the monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. the drama is laugh-worthy. i cannot remember when i saw a more dreadful film. the story is weak, thin, predictable, and completely fake. the adults try to be good actors, but they just can't seem to break through stereotypes. the girl even appears to want to leave the film via falling off a hill during the movie in order to leave it, i don't blame her. micheal anderson should publicly apologize for this film. not just to me, but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film. in fact, i apologize to you. even if i had nothing to do with this project, i apologize for this film, because this means at least someone will. this film even surpasses the dismalness of films that of rob schneider and the cheetah girls. i would even go as far to say that it is even worse that hilary duff's collection of films, but that's pushing it. just please don't see this film, or else you'll be pushed to write a review similar to this one on how awful this film is. i'm very sorry.

an old high school teacher of mine used to brag that he'd seen every movie ever made, so one day a friend of mine and i decided to make up a movie called "pacific inferno". later, we got into an argument whether the lead role was played by carl weathers or billy dee williams. our teacher found the argument interesting, so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in "pacific inferno" was played by jim brown. we thought he was trapped in a lie, that was until we went to the library and discovered that "pacific inferno" was in fact a real movie. this incident forced me to rent the movie... it's horrible. our made up movie had a better plot than this piece. weathers and billy dee would have been much better in the picture.

stay away from this movie! it is terrible in every way. bad acting, a thin recycled plot and the worst ending in film history. seldom do i watch a movie that makes my adrenaline pump from irritation, in fact the only other movie that immediately springs to mind is another "people in an aircraft in trouble" movie (airspeed). please, please don't watch this one as it is utterly and totally pathetic from beginning to end. helge iversen

what was i thinking when i rented this one? what did the distributor think when he copied the tape and shipped it all the way to holland? that anyone really wanted to see this s***?!?it's about some astronauts getting into trouble outer space (apollo 13 flashback, but never even in the shadow of this fine film) and they want to return to home. if you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (deep impact and armageddon), and this one fails everywhere. deep impact and armageddon weren't perfect either (far from it), but they were at least worth watching once (and maybe one more time when we're all old). they gave some fun. max q doesn't. it gives irritation. okay, okay. it's a tv movie, but does that mean you're allowed to come up with such a mess?if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.it gets at its worst at the end when the space shuttle lands on... no, i can't 'spoil' this one (imdb guidelines forbid it). so you have to see for yourself. no! don't see it (sorry), but rent a movie which is worth renting (like battlefield earth... just kidding!)probably the worst one i have ever seen.

the plot was not good.the special effects weren't.the acting was... not very good at all.like others, i felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle through.i thought the ending was rather unbelievable.by the way guys, about the "blow torch in space".blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (hence the name "oxy-acetylene torch"). two hoses run from the torch: one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle.so a "blow torch" would work just fine in space.

when "deranged" was made the film-makers saw fit to turn ed gein into ezra cobb even though the resultant film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case. i presume that enough was fictionalised that they thought they should change names and such."ed gein - the butcher of plainfield" masquerades as a true story retelling of the gein case, but actually bears very little resemblance to the history. as a biopic type film it is a travesty. if ever a film needed names changing it is this one, far more so than "deranged". it is as close to the true crime story as "dirty harry" was to the true story of the zodiac killings.ok, so, that annoyance aside, how is it as a horror film? well, as a horror film, well, as a film generally, it is quite appalling. one of the worst films i have sat through in months. issues run thus: 1) kane hodder is quite astonishingly miscast as ed gein. utterly unsuitable in the part, hodder just lumbers through glowering menacingly. very bad.2) kane hodder is the best actor in the film! the rest of the cast are rather "amateur dramatics" and utterly unengaging. it is painful to witness some lines being delivered.3) the occasional efforts of stylish film-making seem to come from "the big book of moody cinematography cliché". you've seen it all before, better executed. aside from the efforts at style, the rest of the film-making is largely inept: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are overlong pointless shots holding back the pace...which leads me to...4) it seems to go on forever. it is under 90 minutes in length, but sitting through it is an ordeal. you'd swear it ran two and a half hours.5) ed gein almost seems secondary. mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff. said deputy is played by an abysmal actor upon whose shoulders no film should rest.is anything good about it? well, the gore fx are very good. some convincing wounds are in display and the make-up is generally excellent. none of this, however, makes up for the massive failings of the film.it doesn't even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not enjoyably bad, not "so bad it's good", just genuinely bad. a film to avoid and despise.

ever since he played a goon in lone wolf mcquade, actor/stuntman kane hodder has been busy. his film, hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but he still makes a couple of more films every year. he should have skipped this one.hodder seems to be the king of the slashers. he has played jason voorhees from 1988's friday the 13th part vii: the new blood (1988) to jason x (2001). he is working on a new film that appears to be a halloween remake. he is very much what i would call the serial killer type with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood.however, there wasn't much blood in this movie and very little action occurred on camera. it felt as if i was watching an episode of real law enforcement on a&e.i won't put the blame entirely on hodder's shoulders, as the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either.michael berryman (the hills have eyes, the devil's rejects) just ran his mouth until gein shut him up. adrienne frantz ("the bold and the beautiful") was cute. veteran actress ("three's company") and penthouse pet, priscilla barnes did a credible job. i am sure there are other horror favorites, but they all just seemed to run through their roles.

my reasoning behind viewing this film (despite the fact that it was free), was more or less out of curiosity... slight, slight curiosity... i wasn't all that familiar with this straight-to-video "biographical" account of mr. gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon kane hodder in the starring role. my emotions turned from not just curiosity, but now a glimmer of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of gein would turn out. also in the credits (among some grim photos of ed's crimes) was michael berryman and priscilla barns. "okay", i thought to myself... "this may be mildly amusing". as the movie started and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as i call it, "micro-hope") for this movie faded entirely and i was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation as i died a little inside from watching this dung heap. hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, inaccurately puts that into play here - turning eddie gein from a mild-mannered recluse, to a hulking, full-blown killing machine. he lurks by night, killing cemetery caretakers, his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls, leaving plainfield in a panic as the local sheriff's department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least. the deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside (or that could have just been the cyanide pill i ingested halfway through this turkey). i'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with. there is already such an abundance of films pertaining to gein's story that, unless the "ed gein snuff footage" is discovered, i don't want to see anymore of these on the shelves. if you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out 2001's "ed gein (aka in the light of the moon)".

i own a vacation lake home not far from plainfield, wi. ten minutes from the gein property to be exact. i've seen his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging, and i've shopped at the hardware store that was formerly owned by the worden family. while visiting relatives in california, we decided to rent this movie. it was disgusting. the true story of ed gein is so disturbing and creepy, why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me. the actor playing ed is a very large man, ed was a very small, meek, and shy man. that is part of what makes his story so frightening. he did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it. you won't break much of a sweat digging a hole. they didn't have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler, just do your research. and if the writing wasn't bad enough - there are no mountains in wisconsin, and i'm pretty certain that 911 was not available in 1957.

i just saw this movie and all i can say is, where are the drive in's these days. this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. interesting to see melanie griffith so young and anne lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress. in fact, there is not much acting going on in this movie at all. it's sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 dodge charger jumping over stuff in the woods. but there is a mecrury comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one!

the video box for 'joyride' says "starring second generation superstars", and one can't help but feel sad. granted, melanie griffith has gone on to bigger and better things...but who cares about the rest of the cast? so with that being the pathetic attention grabber on the box i was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking i would be in the land of 'so-bad-they're-good 70's films' eh, not so much. while so many aimless 70's youth films (or plain ol' 70's films for that matter) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, 'joyride' doesn't even try. it's just aimless. it is devoid of any interest whatsoever. each character is so poorly conceived that it's no wonder these actors look so listless.in a nutshell the movie is about three 20-somethings who go to alaska to start a business, but instead get robbed and then have to find work. they get beat up, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. it's all very typical but on top of that it's executed in the most mundane way possible. there are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all.but if you're a fan of melanie griffith's breasts - then this is a must-see. that's still not enough to get this above the lowest rating i can give.best line: "jesus, everything is biology with you." * out of ****

a pre-nerd robert carradine, a pre-automan desi arnaz jr., and an almost pre-pubescent melanie griffith take to the road and head for alaska with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy salmon fishers. well, their dream is about as exciting as this lackluster youth road movie. they aren't particularly interesting, and the film doesn't exactly have much of a point, beyond `we got together the spawn of some famous people and made a low budget film about their misadventures.' out of the cannon of 60's and 70's road films and rebel youth films, this one is mediocre, under developed, uninvolving characters, not much wit, not much freshness to the story, which is as bland as the films muddy landscape.but, for those who care- they head to alaska, and apparently alaska was like the wild west in the 70's because everyone carries a gun and is rough and tumble. robert carradine says charming things like `i hope we can find a shower, my nuts sure itch.' (and he's the one with melanie griffith!) they are quickly robbed and forced to take jobs, and the local bigwig, their employer, puts the moves on melanie and eventually fires desi for not being corrupt. that's when they aren't smart and do not leave town, opting instead to eat dog food or go hungry, get beat up by the guys goons, and then take a joyride in the bigwigs car. the final half of the film abandons the evil bigwig as the trio commit a robbery, go on the run, and hatch a kidnapping scheme, and so forth. the film just sort of ends, annoyingly and ambiguously, but seeing as how they didn't bother to have much character development and story in the first place, its rather appropriate. worth a look if you are really into low budget 70's fare, but ultimately pretty forgettable.

ken burns' "baseball" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. there's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. it's clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his "nine inning" concept. it's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! this is syrupy, mawkish drivel. billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he's sold us before. ken burns uses the national anthem as the series' theme song, and manages to play "take me out to the ballgame" so many times you might vomit. we get it, dude.clearly burns is a neo-hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as kenny is today. for shame! he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times! burns falls head over heels in love with buck o'neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o'neil waxes poetic about his playing days. nonsense...burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. "baseball" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as americana. its clear that burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, mr. burns? there's no crying in baseball.

well, that's what this should have been called, anyway. mainly, due the the ridiculous, ham-fisted use of what can barely be called symbolism by the director. it would not have surprised me to find out that this was a) one of lea pool's earliest efforts, and b) at least semi-autobiographical. turns out a is wrong, although i don;t know about b. i will bet she attended boarding school, though, and had a rather terrible same-sex relationship of some kind. this is the message that was beat down our throats by this film, and the short film which preceded it, the name of which i no longer recall.at any rate, the character development was clumsy (who introduces herself by saying what her name means? nobody.) the symbols were about as subtle as an all-glass elevator full of teen-age girls losing a cable and plummeting eighty stories. all over a loudspeaker. honestly, the cry of a falcon when perabo declared she was a raptor and leapt off the table? that was ridiculous to the point of parody. and it was only one of far too many symbols meant to show even the dumbest of viewers what her point was. and that was that she had a crappy childhood and feels the need to make movies about it, ala vincent gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, ala all of us who get on with our lives. there was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing moving about this film. it was poorly enacted trash, and the actors could not save the brett ratneresque over the top "hey this is my point in this movie" use of film techniques, writing, and acting. sorry, but it was terrible.

if you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then i can imagine giving it a good rating... but i cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. yes, it's also bad the way victoria treated paulie, but guess what. that's life. isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life? or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children? secondly, when mary's father didn't show up for the dinner, and paulie helped mary release her anger, that mary even said she wished he were dead... somehow i don't think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger.

the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible.they had a nice budget, though so do many films; they made it look slick and pretty, and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film... and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools, (you know, the place all lesbian love lives and dies). this is a theme that has been done again and again and again in film, but something that viewers-if one uses this voting forum as a clue- cannot seem to get enough of.every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through. the lead characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, genius, rebel lesbian tough girl (well, they took a super pretty femme like piper perabo and tried to rough her up, but it didn't stick much) seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her. watching them every step of the way is character 3, a dopey, well-meaning, wide-eyed, good girl observer. i say 'every step' because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest, most inane monologues.her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk. "hearing them (make love) with their noises was um, you know, like, well... okay!" she says about her 2 wanton roommates, who roll around in the bed next to her.later she asks graham greene- the accomplished native american actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener (!) "is it wrong to care what people think?"sorry, but is she a teenager, or is she age 7?granted, piper perabo (as polly the tortured dyke) & others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. she would do well in a decent project, so this is in no way a criticism of the acting.but this story is shameless in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character. they couldn't stop with her (polly) being an angry, crazy-passionate, secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher. oh but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of "gabbing"."that's a word they (males) use against us (women)!" she says, stomping out of the classroom.is this all the writer could come up with? or maybe we should ask: why stop there? poole and co. went on and made polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods.cue the slow motion, sci-fi, xena atmosphere!then we have her writing to her birth mother... (most lesbians are love-starved orphans, in case you were in the dark).then we have two teachers (one uptight, one a zany type with loose neck ties) who hover around all of the action (the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers)... and give dark child/ seductress/bird girl tense looks. hmmmm. i wonder if something well, you know... um, funny is happening between these two teachers??????there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. heartbreak happens, but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock.i cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end, but if you are not laughing, i can only guess you are crying. and not for the right reason. and i don't mean the wimpy make out scenes.

if you find the hopelessly amateurish acting, the uninteresting story, the fake blood and all the mindless shooting bearable, then you may actually have a fairly good time watching this trashy, low-rent exploitation film. you might also want to check out a pretty good catfighting sequence that's offered, although it's not good enough to make the rest of the movie worth sitting through.

pam grier is the super soul sister of the 1970's, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. i can safely say that black mama, white mama may be the worst pam grier movie i've ever seen.grier is lee and margaret markov is karen; they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. chained to each other, the film becomes the defiant ones for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (filipino sleaze star vic diaz) wants lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent sid haig) searches for the two girls; and karen's revolutionary friends search for her. the film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been men chasing women. grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in any of the many (overlong) action scenes. markov is excellent as karen and grier is ok as lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. one interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and his chief to drop their pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by his whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem.black mama, white mama starts out great as a women-in-prison film complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, then completely switches to a chase film. if director eddie romero (famous for directing filipino horror films) had just stuck with the wip theme, he would have been fine. instead, bmwm gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a 90-minute film for it to end like this! another problem: where is the film supposed to be set? while some of the accents are hispanic and cities have spanish names (los robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously asian! hmmm... recommended only for die-hard grier fans, who even then will be disappointed.

the title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. it's a grade-c howler but not as blatantly funny as i was hoping. directed by exploitation film specialist eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan demme (long before directing "silence of the lambs" and "philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. playing hooker and small-time drug dealer lee daniels, blaxploitation superstar pam grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten margaret markov is the other half, karen brent, an unlikely patty hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as lee and karen are pitted against each other. of course, they escape but shackled together a la "the defiant ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for lee who stole $40k from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of filipino women, a dog wears karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). there is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. sadly, grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while markov is an amazonian blonde whom i am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed sid haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. the 2003 dvd contains only the original trailer as an extra.

this is one heck of a sleazy film. like so many "women in chains" films, this one is chock full of lesbianism. however, unlike most prior films, which strongly implied this, black mama, white mama shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard leers at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates. for the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft-core pornographic film--sort of like girls gone wild goes to prison! it's also a bad rip-off of the defiant ones, though in this case it's two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they escape. whereas the original film is considered a classic, this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. that's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap--cheap thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting.pam grier is the "black inmate with an attitude"--a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island. margaret markov is a revolutionary. when they escape, they both can't stand each other and have opposite goals. however, since it is cliché-driven, there's really no surprise in how the film ends--with their both becoming (gag me) friends.

the plot for black mama white mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the phillipines. one black, and one white. these two women, are thrown together in the prison. pam grier is lee daniels lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the phillipines and assume a better life. margaret markov plays karen brent, a white women from a privileged background, who is also a revolutionary. karen has joined a group of revolutionaries, determined to change the corrupt phillipino political system. she's captured by phillipino authorities, and held as a political prisoner.the story-line takes-off, when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together. the two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist. as they flee, they also fight with each other, because they have different goals to pursue. naturally, they hate being chained together. but they also realize that they must put aside their differences, to help each other survive while they evade capture.if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage, it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same, as well as their location in the phillipines. roger corman, has always had a consistent stable of actors, that he used in all of his 70s b movies. besides pam grier, sid haig, roberta collins, claudia jennings, betty anne rees, and william smith, were also among the many actors that were frequently cast, in corman's aip films.like the big bird cage, black mama white mama, relies on too much gory violence to be palatable. pam grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film, and shows her competence as a female action heroine. margaret markov is less effect, in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen. she just seems to fragile and well-coiffed, to be a dedicated political guerrilla. except for sid haig, as the colorful ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable.this film has little entertainment value, unless excessive, heinous acts of violence are your thing. only the performances by pam grier and sig haig, make this film worth watching.

and you'd be right. black mama, white mama, also known as 'women in chains,' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b-movie that the premise suggests. pam grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women, and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximum-security prison. it's not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line 'strip 'em and get 'em wet,' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman's fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like. the prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it's a girls gone wild shoot, then they all hang out together in their dorm, openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape. i've never been to prison myself, but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about, prisoners or guards or otherwise. the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans (and no pants. go figure) that say prison on the back. must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that can't afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms.and as is to be expected, a prison that can't afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other.the conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that lee daniels (pam grier) spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison. i won't go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck, and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons. karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner, and the cops are after both of them all the while.(spoilers) so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to revolutionize life as they know it. meanwhile, karen just wants to get off the island, something she's been trying to do for years, and isn't it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals. so we get this odd couple pairing and, since they are an odd couple, it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end.in a movie with so many conflicting interests, especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie. not about to leave anyone unsatisfied, they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie, where everyone shoots machine guns at each other, killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat. nice. even better, at the end of the movie, after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place, the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful, awful special effects, and we learn that he will be a major before dinner. not a bad way to end the movie, the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit, but here is the last line in the film  'it's better to win, isn't it?' is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major? because he figured that out???

some of the films produced by roger corman's new world film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of b-movie, where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of freeing influence on the writers and directors  such classic drive-in films as "deathrace 2000", "hollywood boulevard", "grand theft auto" and "caged heat" emerged from this environment. unfortunately, his former confederates at american international pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s, particularly in the absence of jim nicholson, and they often produced second rate imitations of corman's films, sometimes featuring his self-made stars. "black mama, white mama" is one of those films. it's basically a cheaper imitation of "the big doll house with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things. yes, this is a john ashley co-production (yes, the same john ashley who was the hilarious elvis wanna-be in "how to make a monster" and paired up with debbie walley in "beach blanket bingo") with all the signature marks of his productions  women's prisons where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 lead characters including the inmates and the guards are filipino actors in mostly non-speaking roles, where we see supermodel-type women taking on the roles of revolutionary militants, and where the primary joy of the film is derived through rudimentary s&m exploitation.the print i saw most recently was horribly light-damaged (good ole will viharo described it as "yellow mama, yellow mama"), but i think even in the best conditions the photography and directing are extremely routine. there's also very little visual value here corman must not have had very much to do with the film itself because he was always canny enough to at least give his films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive. this film doesn't look impressive, it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack, and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a shred of talent. the only remotely interesting performances come from pam grier as a feisty whore out to escape the life, filipino actor dindo fernando as her grotesquely self-indulgent pimp, and sid haig as a cowboy styled mercenary. the story places grier and co-star margaret markov in a low budget female version of "the defiant ones", but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities afforded by that premise. it's basically just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while they're trying to escape the prison together. this is all in the spirit of good fun, but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation because there's a certain edge and rawness that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under this director's hand with a kind of yawning predictability.so the film will have little value for fans of hard-core exploitation value  at least in the version i saw it's no more explicit than "faster pussycat, kill! kill!" from over a decade earlier, and far less interesting visually and thematically. for those who just enjoy getting a laugh out of "so bad it's good" films, this one might provide some fun but it's not in the upper tier. people would be more advised to seek out "caged heat" or some of the others that revel in their own brutality to the point that it becomes camp; this one is more similar to less ambitious efforts like cirio santiago's "the muthers". sadly, the best thing about this particular film is the title and the presence of pam grier, who was better in other films around the same time (particularly jack hill's "coffy"). this film perhaps illustrates a midway point in miss grier's journey from corman secretary to b-movie queen-for-a-day, but other than its historical "significance" as such it will have little value even to grier's big fans because she is given very little to work with here.worth skipping, unless of course you get to see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like i did. and even then its value is questionable.

imagine an exploitive remake of the defiant ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. set the story on some caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. and have the black woman be from huggy bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down patty hearst and you've got black mama, white mama.in those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. all the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed in this one. even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake pam grier and margaret markov for sidney poitier and tony curtis. all right, halle berry and jamie lee curtis.margaret and pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look lasciviously at the new fish arriving. margaret is a rich girl from the state who took up 'the revolution', whilst pam's your basic high priced call girl who's been servicing the local drug kingpin and grew tired of it and tried to leave the island.margaret's fellow revolutionaries ambush the bus transporting them from the women's prison to town, but they get lost in the escape. both have their different agendas, but like sid and tony they can't quite agree on whose agenda comes first. makes for some interesting times as the police, the drug dealers, and the revolutionaries are all looking for these two illfated chain buddies.just so you don't get any wrong ideas the head of the revolutionaries and markov's kanoodling partner is named ernesto played by filipino actor zaldy zshornack. the whole mess was shot in the phillipines who were getting their own film industry started.nice location photography in the phillipines is all that black mama, white mam has to recommend it. but if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks, this is one for you.

let's just say that it might be the worst movie i've ever seen. on the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling reservoir dogs. i fell for it hook, line, and sinker. this is just a warning message to anyone who might read this. it's not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at.

this has got to be one of absolute worst movies i've ever seen in my life. the writing and acting are just pathetic. it ranks right up there with uncle sam on the all time worst movies ever made. however, when i see crap like this able to make it to video, it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because i know i could do a better job than what the makers of killers did.

this film is an embarrassment. nothing works on any level. the direction, screenplay, acting , and editing work together to repel your eyes from the screen. everything is inappropriate and incoherent. at first you can sit there with and groan, wince, and laugh at it, but very shortly the whole effort of watching just becomes too ponderous.

...but you can see it from here.i definitely don't understand why anyone would recommend this movie. not a bit of plot, not suspenseful, not well-made. no point to having made it, really.completely forgettable in ever way.

much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to r dogs made on the dvd cover. forget about all of that... this film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. how can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? there is no plot, none. i couldn't believe that i spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that i had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential. the only thing i do really remember was that, unbelievably, one of the annoying main characters was supposedly offed with a bullet to the head... and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive. wow. and looky dere, killers has a sequel. double wow.true story -- i actually was in so much denial that i had wasted my money and life force on this rental that i kept the videotape for what must've been six months. i kept telling myself that it never actually happened. the video on top of the tv was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-loathing. after someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that i needed to get a grip, i decided that i couldn't just leave it there. i thought, "how many others have i denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by hoarding killers all to myself?" i had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came. so, as i imagine most of the populous of imdb would do in a similar situation, i mustered up some major courage and drove to the video store... at 2am. after making sure that no one was around, i got out of my car (still running of course), slipped the movie into the drop box slot, and booked the hell out of there never to return.i guess i expected that some goons from hollywood video corporate would come looking for me (the bill must've racked up to something like $1,238.67 by that time) so i moved away from the area. however, coincidently, much like the killers storyline, nothing ever happened.

i'd liked the takashi miike films i'd seen so far, but i found this pretty disappointing. i'd bought it, but i won't be keeping it.i saw it on the adness dvd, which has just two episodes. in the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. you can tell that from the dvd box. in the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by tv static. had you not seen the dvd box, the viewer wouldn't know what people were looking at until later a young cop produced a small model of the body. oddly, there is also a flash frame later on of the woman's head and it is not censored. apart from this, i'm not really sure what was going on. some women get phone calls, and a sketchy animated character cavorts around when that happens. an animated character also appears on tv screens sometimes. it's unclear if anybody sees it.in the second episode, pregnant women are being found cut open and their babies are missing. again, a cop produces a model of what the corpses are like, which is helpful since again the actual body is censored. there is also a natural birth in the movie, but oddly even that baby and the umbilical cord are censored! according the the dvd box, uncensored versions were not kept when this was originally made. perhaps even if they had, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they didn't bother actually showing anything...? not sure.if i hear the later episodes are better, maybe i'll look for them. as it is, i won't bother.

ah animorphs. i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation, i was very excited.boy what a let down the final product was. i think for me, this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic.so what was wrong with the series? let me count the ways: 1. the characters were horrifically miscast. in the books, the animorphs were somewhere between 12-14, the television cast were at least 18. i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos.2. horrific acting/bad writing. i dunno which was to blame so i'm lumping into the lumpy mass that it was. perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because marco - not funny. in fact, i don't remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few. the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worst.3. my lord they were stingy with the budget. the final result of the andalites alone should have convinced viacom to pull the plug...their heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmet.4. back to the cast - rachel by far was the biggest let down, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent in the tv series was "scarecrow". also, i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot".5. one of the worst opening titles ever. did the music have to be that obvious? 6. answering question 6, "yes" because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn't the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap-rock rip-off or whatever the hell that was.since then, there have been bigger let downs (iraq, 2004) but in case i haven't made myself clear - this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from.

...and in this series, i've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. remember my friend marco, who got all the good lines in the books? well, in this series his one-liners put mr. freeze to shame. remember our uber-evil nemesis visser three? he's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. remember rachel, "xena, the warrior princess", and cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? they've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for tv. remember the awesome extra-terrestial ax, who was cool, intelligent, and really, really liked cinnamon buns? in this series he's the token alien with an extremely annoying voice. remember the witty banter our team had in the books? in this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it's obvious the writers were pandering to the lowest common denominator.so forget everything you thought you knew about the animorphs! it was cassie who became allergic to morphing, not rachel, thought-speak is *supposed* to echo, and visser three and ax, rarely, if ever, appeared as andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). i'm not crazy. and i'm not lying. the jerks are all around us. and if you're unlucky, one of them might adapt one of your favourite books, or series, or graphic novels, into a really awful tv show. you've been warned."finally... television worth watching." ~ (the very bald) visser three(r#91)

"my blue heaven" is boring. the plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. the leads, betty grable and dan dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. david wayne and jane wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.there's really only one reason to watch "my blue heaven". one reason...one star: mitzi gaynor, in her film debut. her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? her pert and promising screen personality, her feline beauty, and her exceptional charisma shine through gloriously and make these minutes the most watchable, memorable, and exciting moments in the entire film. if you would value an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise, then check out miss mitzi gaynor in "my blue heaven."incidentally, i scorn (and would urge you to avoid) drew casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive dvd commentary for this film. wordy, digressive, unduly fastidious, frequently ill-timed with what is playing on the screen, and galloping throughout with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.

so bad, it's entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink, or whatever to get through this turkey. where do they get the financial backing for such paint-by-the-numbers "horror" flicks? the fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order, and trashing the so-called "uniforms" the "military" jokers wear. the raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in "jurassic park," but a cousin species. (sorry, no spoilers here. you'll have to watch it to find out for yourself) don't expect the plot to make sense, simple as it is, just go along for the ride. you could make it a game... take another drink each time you hear a certain sound... or better yet, every time someone gets crunched by a "raptor." with a little luck, you won't even remember having seen this "c-grade" made-for-tv movie!

roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career, spanning over 300 movies. while few (if any) would call him great, his films' obscure connections to underground culture (via reference, tribute, or influence) have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts. throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films ("piranha", "humanoids from the deep", "the black scorpion", etc.), without improving on them in the slightest. "raptor", "written" and "directed" by "jay andrews" (jim wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures, "chopping mall") takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding corman's mid-'90s "carnosaur" trilogy.	wynorski's credits are in quotes because "raptor" isn't a tribute to the "carnosaur" films, and not even a remake. "raptor" is the "carnosaur" films, or at least the film's dinosaur-induced death scenes, haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes (many of which consist of "dino's eye view" shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious). the "new" material was written around the footage, instead of vice versa, and is totally unremarkable, with huge gaps of logic (e.g. two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts 2 and 3, where the soldiers had different uniforms, could be included), which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the "carnosaur" films already. the actors' lack of any feeling in their characters (though in fairness, any character dimension is only presented in the script once, maybe twice) brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in 1950's b-films, and it certainly doesn't make anything between the ripped-off attack scenes worth watching. even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book, the "spring-loaded animal", something is seriously wrong.	as it stands, this is a despicable practice in two b-grade figures (who need not worry about ruining their reputations, because they haven't got one) ripping off their own material, for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks, simply because they can (why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the "jurassic park" series?). there isn't much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing; the only good thing about it (besides gazing at melissa braselle's navel) is that now i don't have to see any of the "carnosaur" movies.

my brother-in-law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video. this should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible. it was. from the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible. it does not even quite register as a "b" movie. maybe an n or a p. one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen. from the rubber raptor-on-a-stick to the still-breathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines, this movie isn't worth watching if you've received it for free.skip this one altogether--unless you want to play mystery science theatre with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.

i go this game and it is alright i guess. i just expected a bit more. the main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get it. also the graphics aren't as good as pandora tomorrow and double agent. this game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens. in my opinion this is the worst out of the three. i haven't played the first one but have played pandora tomorrow, this and double agent. this game deserves a 4/10 though. could do with some improvements.

there is a difference between a "film," and a "movie." a film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. in my time as a viewer, i have seen may examples of both.on september 19, i attended a screening of writer/director jon satejowski's "donnybrook." now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, i can safely say it is a movie. and a student movie, at that. it is, for lack of a better word, competent, which is to say, the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. the visuals are, for the most part, static and unimpressive, and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. i understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual flair would have been appreciated, and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested.granted, there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written, engrossing story and some sharp dialog. steven soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape" comes immediately to mind. this movie, however, has neither. the main story is weak and unfocused. if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father, then i feel this movie misses the point. what i got out of it is that davie's main aspiration is to "change the face of rock 'n' roll." however, we see very little activity on his part to show this. while there is one dream sequence at the beginning, and an impromptu performance of his at the end, all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. we are simply told that davie has played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full rock out mode. next time, show don't tell the audience. anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. also, davie doesn't look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970's; he looks like he'd be more comfortable in the early days of rock 'n' roll, posing as james dean's less talented brother. in the meantime, the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters, and story threads, that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story, are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving terry's father). if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction, i will consider watching "napolean dynamite" again, a film i could barely make it through the first time.as for the above mentioned dialog scenes, i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between. is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? i don't think it is. when the characters do speak, it is in short, choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions, angered grunts or wildly over-the-top outbursts. these characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. working with material like this, it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, al hudson's, and that's just because he's doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen. a good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director, would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. however, with satejowski being so close to the material, he simply doesn't see them, or, if he does, he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it'll hurt his creative vision. being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner, is the mark of a self-indulgent, misguided fool. just ask rob schneider. in the end, we are left with a poor, high-school-set, knock-off of zach braff's amazing "garden state" combined with the equally amazing "velvet goldmine," two films far more worthy of your time.now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review, allow me to offer this. the best i can do is compliment mr. satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. however, the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. this is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. if the movie holds any promise (and let's face it, at this point, it isn't going to come from the acting, writing, or directing), it is this: if, if, the people associated with this film are willing, then, please, learn from this movie, file it away, and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; don't attack your critics, or have friend or family do it for you. if you are able to do this, maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a "film."i am your audience, and i am willing to watch.

any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god-awful college experiment. it was lousy, slow, and painful to watch. running time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and half hours. the only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing on how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots. two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever( or what seems like forever), no close-ups!! no medium shots!!. there are two so-called fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shoot some close-ups or medium shoots for them. they looked very amateurish. the scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if there was a cut away of just the father or just the son acting,or reacting. tri-c must be very mortified to show this any where. i have seen a bunch of bad movies in my time some of them are fun because they so bad, this is not one of them.

first of all, let me underline, that im not a great fan of political correctness. in fact i like satire or dark humor, even if it makes jokes out of minorities. the reason, why im pretty sure, that this racist piece of work is not worth a look, is that it doesn't make fun of minorities to demonstrate their condition of living, their social circumstances or the way they are treated by society. moreover it uses every stupid stereotype and prejudice to strengthen xenophobic feelings and reservations. its really a pity, but not a surprise, that the other comments didn't get that point, cause we all had a cheap laugh. congratulations.

i like dark humor and non-pc stuff, but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself. bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap.there are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny, but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the very easy task of making fun about turks in germany. it is a very easy task, but if your are the germany equivalent of an inbred redneck (=inbred southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you certainly will fail at this and also at life. i have heard and seen so many funny stuff about minorities in germany, but this "movie" (this piece of crap being listed here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like the calf the makers of this movie met some years ago.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i could hardly stay awake. the acting and the plot were horrible. i like b-movies, but this movie has nothing that could make me laugh or think about. ok, there were two or three funny moments at the beginning, so i have to give this movie 2 out of 10. if you really want to watch it, watch the first 10 minutes. after that you will get more and more disappointed while the movie runs.

it seems that all companies that are enjoy with the taxes taken by romania for picture,grant the image that disappear since 1994 .they are hardly try to get the oldest car the had founded, but they never take pictures of the lamorghini,ferrari,aston martin and all new mercedes that are more the you can find in some important countries.a second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in bucharest where they had the possibility of clear the streets and put garbages on dressing people with i don't know maybe '90 clothes a making them seem so stupid that you will realize the script was maybe a second hand bought from ebay or worth.i wist for future to keep making movies in us and to make good money there than to give us a little bit and shame our country.i have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message(beyond my english---:sorry)

yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. and of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously. snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. colloca proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal. the worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are: 1  cheap looking villains. 2  perfectly timed one-liners. 3  intense car chases with massive explosions. 4  the hero hooking up with the hot chick. 5  multitudes of nude or scantily clad women for no reason. ok so i lied, it covers those but does so horribly.

meh, sums it all up for me really. boring story, bland dialogue, dull action scenes (how do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring? do you actually have to try to do that?), no real characters etc. just dull. snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in any of his dtv work, when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action, fights, shootouts, etc. how can it be that hard to handle? my personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care. there is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. look at snipes in the first 2 blades, passenger 57, rising sun, new jack city, demolition man etc? awesome, intense performances complemented by decent (if not always outstanding) scripts, good supporting casts and wicked action.none of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame. the distributors slap wesley's face on the cover, knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years.i'd love to see snipes work with somebody like isaac florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a dtv production, and work with alpha stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there. together they would all make an awesome team and a snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing.detonator sucks. it's not as bad as the marksman, which chews, but it still really sucks.

at first sight, i must say already, watch the contractor, 2007. with wesley snipes too. a better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.the detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.really, what you expect wesley snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? don't blame him, he needs the money.this was the first impression when i saw the movie, 3 years ago. but i won't see it again, no way. screw it. it sucks. there. i said it.ps: i don't think i ever said "this movie sucks" on a imdb review. thank you, detonator!

ok, ill be brief. this film wasn't just bad it was very very bad, with line4s like " if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh*t on your shoes" you know your in hideous film territory. after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family, it gave me such a vast feeling of self-loathing i wanted to do murder. don't watch this film. i will kill again. but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirts.fortunately there is a flipside, its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierra.unfortunately it ends up trashed on its roof :(ps: worse than the marksman

i am from romania ... and for that i apologize if my english is not so good.i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. i always liked wesley snipes's movies but this one is terrible. i regret that i spent over 3 hours downloading this film. there are a lot mistakes in the film. for example, the stadium in the film is not lia manoliu. the name of the stadium is ghencea. the name of the soccer team is called steaua bucuresti, not uli.the scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc. it's a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. the uli(seaua) team's opponents are displayed on the scoreboard as din ( probably from dinamo bucuresti - who are steaua's main rivals in the romanian soccer championship). the images from the soccer match are from a match between steaua bucuresti and poli timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look it up on the internet and you will see why). the police cars in the movie are not properly made. there isn't a single dark-blue police car in romania! they are all white! the "mistake list" can go on and on and on ... but i will stop here! in short terms this movie is horrible. it does not worth renting it, it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it, it does not worth downloading it! i honestly feel sorry that wesley snipes played in this movie. a previous movie of his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in romania ... was ok but this is terrible!

let's get one thing straight: i like much of snipes' work. unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries (seagal and van damme) he can actually act. this film, however, does little to enhance his reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable - but i am not in any hurry to watch it again either. in fact, if i never saw it again it wouldn't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! it's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film. instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much over-the-top violence and very little characterisation.the biggest problem i have is with snipes' co-star, silvia colloca. it baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful (for my money anyway) and talented actress like miss colloca and then give her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play with. if she was hired to simply add a bit of "glamour" to the movie she doesn't even do that very well; there's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning. strange, really. given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity. are we living in 2007 or in 1957? what the producers of this rubbish (and probably the actors as well) have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies. like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring. i would love to be chasing terrorists, be able to handle myself like mr snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like miss colloca. this film satisfies none of those fantasies very well. which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review!

the detonator is set in bucharest where some sort of ex cia government agent named sonni griffith (wesley snipes) has tracked down a arms dealer named dimitru (matthew leitch), things go wrong though & dimitru finds out that sonni is working for the us government. after a big shoot-out most of dimitru's men have been killed by sonni which the local romanian police force are unhappy about, top man flint (michael brandon) decides to send sonni back to the us & at the same time protect a woman named nadia cominski (silvia colloca) who is also being sent back to the us. however it turns out that nadia is wanted by dimitru & his football club owning boss jozef (tim dutton) who need her in order to complete a deal for a nerve gas bomb which they intend to set off in washington killing millions of people...this american & romanian co-production was directed by po-chih leong & the detonator confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that wesely snipes has joined the washed up action film stars club who are relegated to making generic action films in eastern european locations, yep snipes has joined such luminaries as jean-claude van damme, steven seagal, dolph lundgren, rutger hauer & chuck norris. i give snipes a bit of credit since he held on a little longer than the rest with the excellent blade: trinity (2004) still fresh in a lot of cinema goers minds (every film he has made since has gone straight-to-dvd) but it had to happen sooner or later, like a lot of the names i've mentioned snipes has lived off the reputation of a few great films & if you look at his career he's been in more bad films that good ones. like the recent films of jcvd & seagal the detonator is pretty awful. the script by martin wheeler is as predictable, boring & by-the-numbers as anything out there. the detonator is the sort of film you expect to see on an obscure cable tv channel playing at 2 o'clock in the morning. the detonator is chock full of clichés, snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman & at first they dislike each other but by the end they are in love, his closest friend at the cia turns out to be a traitor while the obnoxious by the book boss no-one likes actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy, snipes character is allowed to run around bucharest shooting, killing & blowing people up like it doesn't matter & he never gets arrested, the action is dull & forgettable, the bad guy own a football club so there are lots of annoying football terminology & there aren't even any funny one-liners.director leong doesn't do anything anything to liven things up, the detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to get over the 30mph mark. ok the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few & far between & utterly forgettable in a 'bad guy shoots at snipes & misses, in return snipes shoots at bad guy & kills him' sort of way. there's a half decent car crash & explosion but very little else. it seems some of the detonator was shot in a romanian football stadium, i think i'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes rather than this film.with a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 the detonator is reasonably well made but not that much really happens. set & filmed in bucharest in romania. the acting isn't that great, snipes just doesn't seem interested & feels like he is just there for the money which i don't blame him for at all.the detonator is yet another poor clichéd action film starring a has been actor & set in eastern europe. why do sony keep making these things? not recommend, there are much better action fare out there.

to start off, i'm easily pleased. i'm in no way a real critic, and movies that authentic critics, friends, family, and newspapers may find awful may even be fun for me to watch.not this one however.i got it since it was the newest wesley snipes movie in my dvd-store. i like snipes, but this was a let-down.bad story, bad actors, continuity-glitches, crappy sound, depressing locations, a pseudo- cool snipes, i really had to force myself to finish the movie.they even left some markings in the shots where a car was supposed to come to a stop.and i'm not talking about "small production company/young director/low budget" kind of bad, where you may ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy.a wanna-be block buster action movie that disappoints like no other in a long time.

since wesley snipes descended(or ascended)to the world of dtv action movies the result has been miss,so-so,and miss.unstoppible was weak.7 seconds was entertaining.the marksman was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank.and what of the detonator?we'll anything would be above suffering the marksman again.but the detonator holds a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget.sonny griffith is a not-so-by-the-book covert op who busts illegal arms dealers in poland.when his latest assignment ends up a bullet-buffet leaving a pile of bodies;sonny then is ordered to escort a witness; nadia (the ever-hot silvia colloca) to the us.trouble is; sonny is being duped by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for gangsters with nuclier ambitions.snipes delivers in the action department.he is in half-blade mode here.he actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator,before descending into pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the marksman.colloca does more than look pretty.there is some conviction to her scenes.a lot of the actors look familiar,and have been in the last 3 or 4 seagal/snipes movies.its always good to see michael brandon again.the action is telegraphed here.but never boring.running,car chases,fights.director po-chih leong seems to have gotten better after the seagal farce;out of reach.he does a credible job.but is constantly hampered by the low budget.enough with the eastern euro-locations.its cheapening the movie's look.vancover cannot be that much expensive can it?the detonator ends just average.it does not have the so-bad its fun aspect of seagal' mercenary for justice. but it is nowhere near as entertaining as van damme's second in command.nor as thrilling as dolph's mechanik.perhaps dolph should direct wesley next eh?its high time the producers pump a little more money and thought into these dtv titles with the kind of money they are making from them.its only fair.the result could be a high seller perhaps?snipes would be advised to try making this one his last dtv action flick.its sad to see yet another waste of this gifted actor's talents.

unlike some of the reviews written here, i didn't hate this movie. it is a movie that could have been much better than it was. not oscar material, true, but much better than it was.i thought the plot had a good hook and through line. granted, this movie was badly written. and terribly directed and produced. i mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? why were we there? what exactly is the point of the opening sequence? it seems like the producer(s) watched american beauty a few too many times and thought 'i'll use that in an action movie!' i thought the movie wasn't that badly acted. wesley snipes did a credible job, he just ran afoul of some bad direction. and once this movie hit the production room, things just got worse. the main actress, i think, had the same problems. some of the other acting was suspect, yes, but it was a low-budget flick. again, i would say it is the director's job to pick that up and correct it.as an overall recommendation, i would agree with the first review i read that this movie is not worth seeing. or maybe it is worth seeing, if you are a film student and want to see what not to do.3/10, and that's giving it praise.

after an undercover mission in bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers, the agent sonni griffith (wesley snipes) is assigned to protect the romanian nadia kaminski (silvia colloca), the widow of an accountant of the romanian mafia. however, the cia safe house is broken in by the criminals, and sonni realizes that the information was leaked from inside the agency. alone, trusting only in his friend michael shepard (william hope), sonni fights to survive and protect nadia.the career of wesley snipes is downhill. i have just seen this flick, and it is another disappointing movie of this actor, whose career is presently very similar to steven segal's one. the movie has many explosions, shots and car chase associated to an awful story and horrible acting. first, the afro-american wesley snipes is chased by the police of bucharest, but they never find a black american man. i have never been in romania, but i believe there are not many afro-americans in this country. his character does not like to bath, wearing the same clothes along many days. there is no chemistry between sonni and the sexy silvia colloca, but she freely has sex, falls in love for him and shares her fortune with him. the boy that performs nadia's son is horrible. my vote is four.title (brazil): "o detonador" ("the detonator")

i've seen a few bad action movies in my days, but this one's just plain awful. i feel it's a waste of time to even write this but i'll make it short. why this movie suck? here are 10 reasons: 1. very amateurly directed and cut. 2. bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. silly dialogs and too many clichés. 4. too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. 5. bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). 6. ridiculously bad performance by the lead female actress. 7. unreliable action scenes (and not too good, either). 8. even for a snipes movie, he shows a big lack of acting materials. 9. outrageous accents (of all the cast). 10. last, but not least - too many implausible facts, such as a tournament of soccer in the u.s., cia needing to do background checks to get new information about their employees, a mattress that is explosion proof and so on. in essence - it's a waste of time, it's not funny, not entertaining, not even as a joke - don"t watch it!!! seriously, just don't.

wesley snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of steven seagal's latest works. the script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. sadly too, snipes has fallen into the trap of having an adr voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. it's sad to see a guy of wesley snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. it's become somewhat of a joke with steven seagal, the fact he doesn't perform his own dialogue, but it's not something i'd have expected from snipes. perhaps it's due to the producer, andrew stevens who has worked with seagal previously, or the director po-chi leong, responsible for seagal's epically bad out of reach.the plot involves shady government officials, terrorists who coach soccer teams, disks with incriminating evidence on and a hefty chuck of missing money. oh and biological weapons. now how they are connected i don't know but what i can tell you is the diabolical script is pretty hard to fathom and like many of these dtv movies, this likes to include one twist too many. the plot is also uninterestingly told, playing out it's cards with people having shady one to ones in offices and dark alleys etc. it's all kind of "lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad bastards watching this film!" the pace of the movie as such suffers because despite the dullness of the performances and the storyline, the film does have some nice action scenes. as an example of how a dtv film has successfully put across a storyline of a twisting nature, i give you dolph lundgren's directorial debut, the defender. that movie had it's share of twists and over complexity but the movie has a last hour of almost entirely action, with dolph under siege form terrorists. the plot points are told in the context of action, on the move, while avoiding death. the movie doesn't stop to tell us what's happening, it doesn't break up the pace. as such although the plot was a little convoluted, it was more forgivable cause the action never let up. the detonator like too many of these films, stops everything to give us a convoluted walk through of who's bad, and who isn't, before inevitably shifting that round in the pulled from the rear end twist at the end. these movies can often suffer with pacing issues.snipes himself as i mentioned is pretty bland here. at the beginning he's putting on a camp persona as he's undercover with some arms dealers. initially it seemed as if he was enjoying himself but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double sleepwalking through the role. snipes only comes alive when he's called upon to kick ass. there's some nice action here though, with some swift and crunching martial arts and some nicely punchy shootouts. the film also features a decent car chase. silvia colloca co-star and she's not much of an actress, but she is gorgeous, with a costume that screams "look at my cleavage!" the rest of the cast flit in and out with clichéd and uninteresting roles.snipes thankfully has better projects lined up from now. he has another team up with mario van peebles, called hard luck, then he will do chasing the dragon, from the director chris nahon, who did jet li's kiss of the dragon. finally snipes is apparently doing toussaint, a biographical drama, directed by danny glover. the future is suddenly looking brighter for snipes, but lets remember he was getting extremely well paid for his dtv films, around $7million a movie, possibly more. it's also funny to consider that of all these dtv god's dolph lundgren is doing the better films, directing himself, with the enjoyable defender and the supremely violent and nicely done the russian specialist, and what's more he's doing them on a fraction of the budgets of these diabolical offerings from wesley and steven seagal are producing. *1/2

what can i say about this? such a big prestige-production - but in the end? wasted time, wasted money.this work a disaster is historically seen. only some examples:* augustus often is named 'gaius' - his first name (pronomen). but the old romans don't used this name. correct would be the surname (nomen gentile and cognomen) or the 'octavian', 'caesar', 'augustus'.* livia was shown as tyrannic wife. but this historically wrong.* iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one. adultery and (maybe?) prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her banishing.* she wasn't at the dying bed of her father. she never was allowed to leave her banishing. and she was at this time around 50 years old! not as young as she was shown. in the same year augustus died she committed suicide, because tiberius stopped giving her a pension.* augustus was much more scruplesless then in this movie shown. but author and director seems to believe augustus' own 'res gestae'.what remains? historically extremely doubtful, bad acting, bad built and equipment - 2 points out of 10 - one for peter o'toole.

what a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square feet of rebuilt ancient rome, 2 millions cubic meters of 50 feet tall buildings, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of works, an international ancient history committee (sic!), some first class actors and actresses . the final result? an empty tv-movie for a single-digit iq attendance.

for several reasons, this movie is simply awful. other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors. well, i have a layman's knowledge of roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant. i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate. and shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some, let's say, historical license. but this movie goes well beyond mere rounding.there's worse. to tell a story from a distant period, the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing. unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period, they will quickly be lost. in addition, the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in italian and english with various actors being dubbed later. at times, the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together. in fact, this is not far wrong. the actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient rome.the only reason i give this boring mess any stars is because i always find peter o'toole entertaining. but that is no reason to rent it. if you are curious about roman history, there are much better movies available.

there is nothing like an oscar wilde comedy, and this movie is nothing like a comedy. the melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent. in the original story, the humor comes from the americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of canterville chase. the american father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains. read the book!

the canterville ghost (1996).the director made this too sappy a production. maybe it's the generation, but i really liked the charles laughton version. there is a time and place for "emoting" and this production does not translate very well. patrick stewart, reciting shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. would neither recommend nor watch again. the close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. the screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue. check out the really good version and pass on this one.

this film's premise seems to be that the passing of the world war 2 generation in america, with its apple-pie phoniness and hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. those awful hippies ruined everything apparently.what holds the film together are the excellent performances - particularly lemmon's which is truly remarkable. otherwise we have a boring slice-of-life drama (just over 24 hours of jack's life) with pretensions.i found it a chore to sit through.

jack lemmon was one of our great actors. his performances in days of wine and roses, the apartment, some like it hot, missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of best actor nomination. his only win was for save the tiger, and that's a shame. he gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note glengarry glen ross. as for the movie, wonderful supporting work by jack gilford as lemmon's partner and thayer david as an arsonist, go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes, angst, neurotic nostalgia, and pointless moralizing. worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970's style experimental direction by avildsen.

jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. while his performance in "save the tiger" is oscar-worthy, i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member. it's too bad the screenwriter's output didn't match that of lemmon's. don't waste your time with this one.

catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about an uptight chef played by zeta-jones, who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash. while she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by eckhart.unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and he's okay, but not much of anything). watching this i was wondering why anyone would want to see this since zeta-jones' character is so unlikable. come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food. ugh. i won't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind. i couldn't finish it.

i recall years back, michael douglas wanted his wife, catherine zeta-jones, to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods. no doubt she does, but not in this film. a colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. this was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be, boring and a huge disappointment. didn't even watch the whole film, torture. catherine zeta-jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen, move around, present a dish but this wasn't the food network, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest brewing, where was the chemistry. the poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there. the loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness. the sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in, not. just a waste of movie time. the promoters certainly did their job to put this lack-luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers. sorry to say, don't spend a dime.

yes, i spelled that right. this movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably. it's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few. sure, it's an ok movie if you have nothing to watch, but you won't miss anything by missing this one.

i hesitated seeing this movie, having really enjoyed the original, 'mostly martha'. what a disappointment. catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film. the original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. no reservations felt like it never connected. the food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. in mostly martha, the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. the food in 'no reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. it was hard finishing the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward. see the original - it's a truly enjoyable movie; the soundtrack incredible.

i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (bella martha/mostly martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. i miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. i don't think that the story itself is enough. martha/kate is more secluded, and mario/nick is not a clown. in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here. the small alterations take away the tension. my opinion is that you should go and see the original. it'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles.

there really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef kate armstrong (catherine zeta jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece zoe (abigail breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. and that reason is to watch aaron eckhart (nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. he reminds me of sean bean. the thought that he might take his shirt off really was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. he removed his apron petulantly several times, but to my disappointment, never went further.i can't be too critical because i was watching it on pay per view at home, so it hadn't cost me the price of two movie tickets at least, and i was brought up to be grateful for small mercies. but really, this is rom com at its most formulaic. zeta jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she seemed utterly lacking in passion, (possibly due to the amount of time she apparently spent in the cold store at the restaurant? thirty takes in there can't have been fun) and her face barely changed expression throughout the whole movie. abigail breslin was pretty good as the niece, she's such an appealing little girl that it's quite impossible to criticize her, and anyway i loved her in little miss sunshine. patricia clarkson is always good value and i can't really fault her performance as the restaurant owner, because she seemed very underused, given what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here. but the whole thing is just so clichéd, much of the dialog banal, and the outcome so obvious. this is the cinematic equivalent of paint by numbers, and zeta jones and eckhart generate little heat on screen.nick likes italian food (doubtless indicating his burning inner passion) and cooks to the sound of puccini. his appearance in kate's kitchen at 22 bleecker (the restaurant's name) predictably ruffles her feathers but his uncanny ability to bond with her niece by cooking pizza and building a bedouin tent in the living room, brings kate around and, despite a few stumbles along the way, she ends up giving him her prized possession. no, not her honour. but her recipe for saffron sauce.i'm being very unfair here, aren't i? i mean rom com is rom com, and we all know what we are letting ourselves in for when we sign up. but does it always have to be so mind numbingly dull?

how bad idea was to remake an almost oscar -worthy film?! mosthly martha is much more better, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (martina gedeck). it's a joke and ugliness with the handsome aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from hollywood. there are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures? the films are getting much less interesting nowadays. oh yes: if you want to see a really good movie watch the original one. it's definitely worth.

there is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. how "mostly martha" was remade is awful. the title of the movie is awful. the actors are awful. and the idea of combining good cooking and usa is awful. if you have seen "bella martha", well that is the original title and it means "beautiful martha", this one is a punch in the stomach. the acting of ms.jones is so poor and unnatural that even jessica alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomactr.asp) would have done better. not to mention the cook, who would better play a different role. and the little girl... not worth mentioning. bella martha was a very nice movie, an authentic one... why was it remade? there was a story.... here they took it out. there is no story... what shall it represent? in one way also this movie was perfect. you know when all ingredients fit together? well this is the case here. a perfect crap....

much as i really like catherine zeta-jones, i wondered once again, why remake a good movie? this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly martha. it was a clear rip off. maxime foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. i couldn't believe abigail breslin. martina gedeck owned this role. unfortunately zeta-jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). sergio castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful italian. aaron eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. this version was pleasant but bland.the love between mario and martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. the therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important. i liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned. i have mostly martha at home. every now and then i revisit it.

go to the video store and get the original. i do not understand why hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. "mostly martha" or "bella martha" has a much better cast. beginning with the heroine martina gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous catherine zeta jones, to the italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. in many ways, the american version of the movie is a copy of the german original. they just exchanged the actors. however, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very believable to materialize a father for the little girl in an american context. i was thinking about that. maybe the father could have been puerto rican, or cuban, or mexican. well, there are so many "guest workers" in the u.s. take your pick. but i doubt that any of them would have shown up to shoulder the responsibility as the italian father did in the original. therefore, the american movie leaves that part out but keeps the italian cook. and by doing this the whole story changes. in the original "martha" is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country. the american "martha" is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have that edge the german movie has. in the original the "italian" cook is not so good looking but much more charming , the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and "martha" is more representative of a career woman in today's world than the watered down version we are presented in the american version. and the whole opera music in the american version was very annoying. i loved the italian songs in the original and bought the cd. hollywood recognized that "mostly martha" was a great movie. maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in english without subtitles. in any case, the original is so much better. by the way this reminds me of another remake. "shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original japanese version and totally forgettable in the american version.

well, i must admit, when i saw the trailer for this movie, i was looking forward to it. i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer, thats the impression i got of this movie. however, i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. although there were a couple of amusing scenes, in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing.i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of opera, making the movie feel dragged out and slow.all in all, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy.not fantastic, and as i have said before; bland.

this movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good, great love story...the cast is perfect, the visuals work, the original premise works, the characters work....but the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable way...not one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director. all we know about catherine zeta-jones character is she is obsessed with her world....nobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her world...that much is obvious....but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposed....aaron eckhart's character had so much more to offer to the story but wasn't allowed, abigail breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phony....in the end everything reverts back to the forced turbulent world of catherine zeta-jones which the audience never totally falls for....honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish, self obsessed, spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world. the director needed to make her a hero and never does....in the end, it is eckhart's character that ultimately wins because he wins.not a lousy movie, just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in, explained and exposed.cheers

this is the ultimate kung fu movie! this is the only kung fu movie! this is the only kung fu movie i have ever seen! i am giving this movie way too much credit! my best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it.this movie's story line was onion skin thin. that acting was goofy and stereotypical of any kung fu movie. the dubbing was literally the worst i have ever heard. it seemed if you played a small role in this movie, like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net, it didn't matter who over did your voice. it could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything. but beside all of this, the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes.the fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about. but the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! on most all instances, a guy either pops out of the tall grass, or glances at the main character from a distance, and then attacks him. but once the fighting started, things sort of balanced out. there were only two things that really hampered the fighting, though. those constant "wooshing" sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword, and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting very jumpy and choppy. someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked, and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch. but while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else, it didn't really affect the overall movie.in the end, this was not a great movie, but i wasn't expecting a great movie. a great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie's. all i saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom. i rarely say that, but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for, so you watch it whenever you have some free time. enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! good day gentlemen.-scott-

i have a friend that works at blockbuster, and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week, so one day as we were scouring the aisles for something interesting, i stumbled across 18 weapons of kung fu, and judging by the box alone, this movie seemed pretty wack, but nonetheless we gave into temptation and rented it -- afterall, it was free.....and thank god it was....this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen....the budget must have been a pickle and a piece of string...the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 weapons" is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that some bad guy is after -- and thats it! there isnt even any weapon fighting in this movie...that and the action sequences are just flat-out bad....9 times out of 10 the other guy's punches and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guy's, and there are many times when the the movie will skip frames (a result of ridiculously poor editing)....the dubbing is as well laughable, and it is hardly even understandable....and we wont even get into the acting...the ending will definitely leave you saying "wtf??", however to be fair i must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent, and the old guy is a mad chump....but thats about it...thankfully i didnt have to pay for this movie, but i guess at least now i know exactly how bad a movie can actually be....

firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of kung fu starring gordon liu. i mention this as my kung fu theater presents dvd has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) the young hero starring hwang jang lee. apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style. the hero is lee shao hwa who i have never heard of before or any of the other actors. the film mentions another director wu yuen ling as well as the one imdb lists. the other actors are wang fu quen, wang wing san, chen fei fei, wang ki san, suen king kai and hwa yue suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this film. the fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the 'star' doesn't have much charisma. the twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it. the scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual. unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating (though acrobatic) young boy.

this is an excellent example of an entreatingly bad b-movie. there are worse movies than this one (titanic for example), but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies.ok this was apparently shot in kansas city, which explains why everyone is so lame. the main guy looks like steve guttenberg, and is even more lame than him! i didn't even think that was possible! in fact, him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the worst drama ever! its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over-dramatic, well actually it was, of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one-two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama.the scarecrow, lets talk about him. the whistling you hear every time he's around is stupid, and obviously dubbed in. now his costume, i cannot get over that - its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask! i simply am dumbfounded, maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage you'd be scared of him/it.one of the characters, the token black guy actually, used the line: "this might be a chance to earn my red wings" when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period. wow, um yea, that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to.oh, in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn, why is it roped off? i'm pretty sure its not supposed to be evident, just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'film' another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yup thats right), there all at the beach, and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and its so obviously dubbed its funny. thankfully, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy's chest when he's done singing. overall the gore like that is pretty good, this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer.ok, there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand, then stand up, whip out their peni, and urinate all over the guy in the sand. who does this? really, imagine it "hey, lets bury joe in the sand, then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him" in fact, this brings up the homo-eroticism in this film, what the hell? a good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing. what the hell is with that? traditionally, in film and real life, jocks get the girls and nerds don't. that really doesn't make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex, and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear, i don't get it.lets get to the sex. as someone who watched this movie with me put it: "i've never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life" and its true. if you like hot a cup action, or ugly old woman boobs, then this film is for you. i swear, they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene?? then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times, and man, i just didn't want to see that.now, i have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film, thats what really is just bizarre. it starts in the daytime, then they all head to the cornfield, and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night, when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach - its instantly day again, and apparently they stay at the beach until night again, and until day the next day. so basically these events in the film cover 4 days, without any of the characters needing sleep or anything, its really weird.after the main killings have taken place, it flash forwards to '3 weeks later' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! the surviving people literally pop some champaign! and thats when i realized the budget didn't go to the script, directing or acting, it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign.the ending. stop reading now if you don't want the ending spoiled for you, it truly is enjoyable.ok, so the end takes place in a church, and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body, then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy, and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars! i'm not kidding, its so stupid! so somehow, in the middle of the fight, the scarecrow's soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr. guy, and then with the last amount of will he has of his own, he impales himself on a cross in the church! its awesome! some blood, but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! you can see the bottom move off the ground! wow, yea have fun watching.

this an extremely horrible movie. and if your thinking you've seen another horrible movie, exactly like this one before, you probably have. you probably saw scarecrow 2 made in 2003. yes thats what i said, brian (the director) stole the movie idea. and not only did he steal it, he actually might have been able to make it worse. i bet the even the actors were scared to tell people they were actually in the movie. also i have to mention that the director was trying to make up for the cheesiness by showing as much tits as possible. also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen, and tried to put together a decent movie, which will never work.

another sequel! why on earth do they keep making these? this has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. scarecrow gone wild - which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... that's basically it. the acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think. a couple nice topless girls, but nothing too pants tightening. let me just conclude my continuous insult (or review) on this movie by saying: if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves, i'm going to be in absolute awe...

scarecrow gone wild starts as high school teenager mike (david zelina) & his mates decide to to give a 'hazing' to wimpish diabetic sam (caleb roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. mike & his mate decide to take sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow & leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? well, things backfire when sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo & the vengeful spirit of sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life & starts to hunt down the kids responsible for sam's unfortunate life-threatening predicament. can sam's best mate jack (matthew linhardt) & his girlfriend beth (samantha aisling) save the day & sam's life?written & directed by brian katkin scarecrow gone wild is the third straight-to-video entry in the scarecrow series & while i haven't seen either of the previous two after seeing scarecrow gone wild i'm certainly in no hurry to change that situation that's for sure. the script actually has an almost decent premise as the wronged soul of sam seeks revenge & his friends have to keep the real sam alive somehow but the way it is told is poor & i suppose that basically it's just an irrelevance to the fact that this is a film about a killer scarecrow running around killing people in not very gory or imaginative ways. having said that there are one or two scenes here which save it from a one star rating, the fart gag in the corn field is funny & something a lot of immature blokes might do (like me), the bit when two guys bury their mate in the sand & then stand over him & pee on him is also rather funny in a laddish juvenile way & a cool bit when some guy starts singing an awful song so the scarecrow throws a pole which impales him! however these ok bits are few & far between & as a whole it's a silly, boring, poorly written teen slasher film with highly annoying character's who irritate. it' also very predictable & has a stupid twist ending which doesn't really feature the scarecrow at all which is a problem as when you watch a film called scarecrow gone wild you expect to see a scarecrow go wild & i have to admit he looks quite cool as horror character's go.director katkin does a reasonable job here actually although what on earth is up with that hospital at the end & all that neon lighting everywhere & the fact there is only one patient there & two members of staff? the cinematography is much better than the usual straight-to-video low budget horror film of late & there's some nice, if totally unrealistic, lighting. the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself. there's not much gore here, there's a couple of scenes where some actor has some fake guts placed on their stomach to represent them being gutted but it looks pretty fake, there's also a burned face & a couple of impalement's but little else. there's a fair amount of naked female breasts on show if that's your thing.technically scarecrow gone wild is pretty good considering some of the low budget abominations i've sat through recently, unfortunately it's still a poor film overall. the least said about the acting the better.scarecrow gone wild isn't as bad as some of the straight-to-video horror crap that's been turning up recently but having said that it's not that much better & it's still a bad film when all said & done. not recommended, the two previous entries are scarecrow (2002) & scarecrow slayer (2003) both of which also went straight-to-video.

1. the largest amount of money spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach, the ones that were supposed to be intestines. 2. ken shamrock is in it. 3. ken shamrock gets destroyed. (he doesn't die which is sad.) 4. it leaves you wanting more... aspirin. 5. the makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like. "just give him a $30 mask." "good enough for me." 6. the scarecrow runs a chick over. awesome. 7. the film-makers don't actually make their actors sing or play the guitar. 8. the scarecrow uses a volleyball pole as a javelin and impales the dude who doesn't actually play the guitar or sing. 9. the scarecrow can choke a dude in like 3 seconds. 10. it makes you actually think of all these things and write them down for other people. god what am i doing.

i watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one, though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. the effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie.i borrowed this one with an open mind, i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie.boy was i wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary, the storyline was so predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode, as i already would guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.overall avoid this crappy movie.save some money.

i knew i was in for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice over mispronounced the word 'scarecrow' (it sounded like scare crew). and sure enough 90 minutes later, after witnessing beyond horrid acting, tedious drama, scarecrow's punches going nowhere near their intended target, but "hitting" it anyway, ken shamrock "acting", and the most stupid illogical ending, i've seen in my life (ok, no, i take that last one back, in about a week). after making it through all that, i openly weeped that i couldn't just go to lacuna a la jim carrey and just erase it completely from my mind. any thoughts i might have had that director brian katkin might have made an ok film given the right circumstances that i had after watching "slaughter studios", are totally and completely gone from my mind now.my grade: f eye candy: tara platt and lisa robert get topless where i saw it: starz on demand (available until september 22nd, 2005)

so me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the scarecrow series!?! keep in mind that this is not just scarecrow three; this is, scarecrow: gone wild. now both of us had seen to the first two scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. let's start with the cover of the dvd first. first we notice a picture of ken shamrock ("the world's most dangerous man") on the cover. apparently he was used to market the movie as the "lead actor". by the way, he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class. next we notice a picture of a very attractive and very scantily clad woman in the middle ground of the cover. i can assure you that she is not in the movie....at all. at the time of rental we assumed that this was to reiterate the fact that the scarecrow was "going wild". in the background we noticed a large carnival on an island out in the ocean. i can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the movie...at all. looking back me and my friend should have known something was up. i mean really, who the heck puts a carnival on an island. now on to the actual movie. we start when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field. don't ask me how they were fused but think of when brandon lee waking up from the dead in the crow. it's just that stupid. but in the scarecrow's defense, he has "gone wild". anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives vicariously through the young man, takes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who had done him wrong. because yes, in the world of the scarecrow, beaches are conveniently located in the same general vicinity as cornfields. to make a long story short the scarecrow kills all who stand in his path without any warning except for the scarecrow's trademark whistle that signals a slashing. this is however rather impossible to believe because the scarecrow's costume's mouth is clearly sewn shut. several tracking shots that would make kubrick roll over in his grave later, and we have one of the worst third installments in a series ever. well except for maybe the third matrix. as joel siegel would say, "this scarecrow is wildly bad."

this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. i know, i know...but how good is it? well, let's not be silly. it's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. ****spoiler****when a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. in keeping with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow, which comes to life and wreaks terrible vengeance on, well, pretty much everyone. the co-eds drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the cornfield. on the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow. writer/director brian katkin does a credible job of bringing some much-needed drama to the film. unfortunately, the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese. much of the acting was fair, but there were some really terrible bits, including an awful piece of poorly done lip-synching. some plot points were left mostly unresolved, and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered. again, better than the previous installments, but still lacking.

well first and for most i'd just like to say that i'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. only the movie in titled "scarecrow gone wild" could bring me back, so here i am.with that being said, i like to start off with this comment. ouch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this movie was really horrible, i mean i know it was going to be bad. but i had no idea that i would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what i thought was a horror movie.let's start with the biggest flaw of the film (to me that is). ken shamrock. now if memory serves me correctly, shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. now if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief (or that's how it looked to me). i mean how else do you explain all of his lines. my all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was "it's been a long time coming". ok????????? the funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed. so if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that it). like i said before, he must have been the comic relief, except i don't think his ufc buddies where laughing.now that i've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie.i'll admit that i can't remember a lot of scenes, and that's not good considering that i just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago. so what i'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1. usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music, it's not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself. so why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling. i mean i saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.2. why on earth were there murders on a beach. i'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. but i guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. i mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.3. the girl running in the gray sweat pants. that really bother during the duration of this film. i mean she looks so ridiculous. plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. i mean what was she like twelve or something. there no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. i mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.4. people trying to get record deals on camera. just when i thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be gorth brooks and oh man was he lame. i don't' remember the whole scene, but from what i do remember it was not pretty. this one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and i mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. the funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. i mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the "token black guy". and that's sad because if i'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of american idoal. but here's where it gets funny. while this guy is all into his new song or whatever. in the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. and boy does he look pi**ed off at this. i mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. so what does he do about this jealousy, well i'm glad you ask. he wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. i don't want to give the death scene away, but i can tell you this. if that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.5. this movie was way longer then i expected. and it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. i mean i'll admit, i didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that i was hoping that the film was over and done with. but no they had to do they twist s**t. needless to say that when i say that coming, i just turned off the t.v. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. thanks to my rather fast judgment i can say that i'll never know what was to happen next. but i promise that i do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! all and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.

you know, i really hate imdb's censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing. but here we go. editing time!holy moley is this bad. i thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since yknow i've blindly rented such gems as frailty and american nightmare before. but this is just abominal. it's about a killer who uses edgar allen poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him. can't these blithering hacks make a good movie without defiling the grave of a great horror writer? i mean, the kills in here are completely devoid of thought or originality, and the references to poe are hokey and fake, without enough thought put into them. they're shallow, and they put poe's work to shame. full of holes, with awful sequencing. the acting is bad too, reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as "fear x", what with all the pausing and un-emotional lines.i realize this is an indie movie, but that's no excuse. i've seen high school kids act better then these morons, and i myself could've come up with better kill scenes and a better plot, given ample time.this has no reason to exist. avoid at all costs.

i bought this movie sight unseen at a sci-fi convention and i got what i deserved for doing something so silly. simply put this movie is implausible, boring and unwatchable.i was so bored and disgusted with the lack of plot development that i turned it off to watch a repeat of mythbusters. i understand that this was a very low budget move, or least it looked like a very low budget move, but that does not excuse the horrible acting, terrible plot and even worse camera work. it looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and getting drunk.maybe if the villain wasn't so laughable and the plot was something that actually could happen in real life with respect to law enforcement it might become so bad it's funny. this movie isn't funny, it's just bad.

this was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting was god awful, the story line also was bad. it was however a good idea. if this movie would have had better cinematics, and a lot better actors, i might of had something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going, that was pretty good. the swinging axe was just horrible, there was absolutely no suspense. and also when the killer is chasing everyone around in the end, he was going from one place to another in just seconds, it makes absolutely no sense.

detective burt williams has been on the trail of the infamous poe killer for nearly three years.burt's daughter kris williams,a homicide agent for the fbi along with her partner sean michaels take over.burt reluctantly steps down from the case and retires.for the next seven months the "poe killer" continues his murderous rampage until kris discovers that the killer uses internet chat rooms to seduce his prey.she logs in as annabel lee and is quickly captured by poe killer.it's time for burt to find the sadist and free his daughter before it's too late.amateurish and supremely braindead horror flick with no suspense and a bit of nasty gore.the acting is hilariously terrible,the characters are painfully dumb and the killer is not menacing.still i have seen worse indie horror flicks.3 out of 10.

this homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by edgar allan poe. the local police have bungled the case for a few years, so now the fbi has taken over. they know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house, because that's where he's hanging out, running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals. so fbi-chick gets kidnapped, which involves her father, the former lead investigator from the local police. to top it all off, a pack of wacky college kids have decided to camp out at the house and smoke a bunch of weed.mostly, the fbi agent winds up shrieking and running around like a little girl, and not a single one of the burly college boys thinks to just stop and take a swing at the wimpy poe-boy. mostly overacted and sometimes underacted, dead end road reeks of a low-budget, cast-with-friends production that has silly points too numerous to cover.

if you love movies about fruity dudes who prance around with a top hats and canes while spouting off random line of poetry while stabbing their victims then this is the movie for you!!if you like movies where it looks like the whole thing was shot with a camcorder, and when people get disemboweled their internal organs are made out of baked ziti an marinara sauce this movie is even more for you!! and if you simply love movies where the acting and dialogue sucks so much that it makes you feel dead inside, then for god's sake run to the video store right now and buy this movie right now!!! hurry go before it sells out!

a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. however, it is not an excuse for poor writing. it is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. the dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.i also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. with that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, "that was perfect". i see better character acting on canadian television.this movie had a paper thin plot, bad acting, poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all. this simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason. if your looking for a quick scare, rent anything else. even the "cable guy" was a scarier film. after watching this film, i think i would have been better off watching a re-run on the x-files.

first, let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting: a serial killer copycatting the works of edgar allan poe (who is one of my writers of all time). sounds cool, right? yeah, definitely not. probably the worst film i've ever seen. ever. and that's not an exaggeration. i've seen a lot of very, very bad movies. this one takes the cake. and i was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it.perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the killer, his entire life's history, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place you should look? hmm. . . possibly. . . his house? what?! no! that's a preposterous idea, anthony! how could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley? *spoilers end* honestly, sometimes i can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find.i think my biggest pet peeve was how the police/fbi acted.for example: black fbi agent: "okay, endangered female, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while i go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be. sound good to you?" moronic female fbi agent: "yeah, sounds a-okay to me. go right ahead. i'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter." black fbi agent: "excellent, that's what i would do!" honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you're a human and want to learn the same.0.5/10: a half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores. congrats.-ap3-

i'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. this movie is a debauchery of his work. i agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. i'd give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.the story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when i was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made. it's really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done. if this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn who're struggling! this movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. by all accounts this was seriously not meant to be a comedy. scary movie is a better play on a horror genre-- this movie just sucks.

this movie made me so angry!! here i am thinking that here's a new horror movie, one w/a sense of intelligence & then the movie starts. the scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the fake gore, must i go on? there are porno movies out with better dialog than this. i understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w/a camcorder & the cast are all friends & relatives. this is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning. maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly. but it seems to me that someone hung a rock around this albatross's neck & it was sinking at a constant rate of speed.

this is the first woody allen film i've found not worth watching. i think woody has tried many different genres to interest results but this movie just left me irritated and bored. the music is lovely but don't bother watching this hopeless mock-umentary.

this film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.i was expecting the usual woody allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but "sweet and lowdown" failed to provide any. the main character, emmet ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. he is so unlikeable, that i do not want to now about him, or care about him. i wonder why a film about him has to be made. the pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore. even sean penn's great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level.i like woody allen's films a lot, but "sweet and lowdown" is a major disappointment.

wow, did this episode start on a stooooopid premise! the enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise!!!!!!! is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. it seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy. the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the good side is saddled with surak--a vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo!! despite a totally awful premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match. but, don't mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi. the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first-run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.

believe it or not, this was at one time the worst movie i had ever seen. since that time, i have seen many more movies that are worse (how is it possible??) therefore, to be fair, i had to give this movie a 2 out of 10. but it was a tough call.

pointless movie about making a movie. no where near the flesh shown in the original, which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music. not here.it's always fun seeing the pathmark guy though.

the '80's were the best of times and worst of times for james karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror-comedies with "return of the living dead" and a year later he acts in this piece of.... this bad movie. a sequel to hardbodies (but not really), has a group of fairly unlikeable characters attempting to make a movie in greece. through design or sheer laziness the line between the film and the 'film within a film' is not only blurred, but throughly non-existent from scene to scene (which would be confusing if i were just interested in anything happening in the movie in the first place. unfunny would be too generous a term.eye candy: nana, fabiana udenio, and many numerous extras get topless; brenda bakke shows some t&amy grade: fdvd extras: just trailers for "hardbodies", "american high school", "strike", "virgin territory" (comes in a double-feature dvd with the first film, for the masochistic)

it's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. it's not the same as the classic line up. all new actors playing the main roles of rag, scotty, etc, with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. and he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. the film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon. even for a t&a movie, this one is a turkey. not even die hard low budget 80's films fans would want to sit through this movie, which has no plot, and plenty of bad acting. this film would have been better off never being released. just plain bad.

this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly - although fairly popular - slapstick californian beach comedy called hardbodies, but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right. it is certainly better than hardbodies i, and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands. the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing, but (except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday) even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes. venus was underpinned by the legend of the re-incarnation of the goddess, and summer lovers had the viability of a "menage a trois" as its theme. in my view both these films were much more successful than hardbodies ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious, it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line. mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and hardbodies ii unfortunately does not. there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co-habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set. the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo-comedy. they are also grossly overlong, so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth. this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned. as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3.	there is little memorable in the acting, but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction - it is in these latter areas that the failure arises.

"hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and plot less. i would add "brainless" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. the scenery has changed from the california beaches to the greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are sorrells pickard (the bearded guy) and roberta collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with pam grier in "the big doll house"). all the other actors are new, but apparently brad zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character (scotty) as grant cramer did in "hardbodies". this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and doesn't come close to matching it in the "hotness" department, either. of course brenda bakke and fabiana udenio are both very pretty, but the teal roberts - cindy silver - kristi somers team is unbeatable. "hardbodies 2" is not the worst of its kind by any means, but if you only want to see one of these movies, the original is the one to get. (*1/2)

jane eyre with full frontal nudity! i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful "woman's picture" and i mean that in the worst possible way. the trouble is, it could have been so good if they had only left out the jane eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the spanish/portuguese jews in early 19th century london. when the sound track music is better than the film, you know you are in trouble. when you fast forward the video because you can't stand the film, just to make sure you don't miss anything, you are in even worse trouble. this film will end up on the romance tv channel where it rightly belongs.

this movie had potential. if it had been handled differently. what it needed was a different director. that's certain. and perhaps a different leading lady. i just can't understand the minnie driver character - or at least how she played it. she was completely unbelievable. i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. i am writing this as i am still watching it. i'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to 'act' something i didn't understand. well, we've just proceeded to the affair she begins with the son (i'm still watching). i'm now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise. if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way, then watch this one.

not good. mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. some comments : 1. i am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil, who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds, says something 2. fine, so rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer. but charles is completely different in all aspects from her father - if anything henry is much closer as a sensual, exalted person 3. how could you ever believe that she would be more attracted to tom wilkinson than to rhys meyer. 4. hard to believe, if she had been in fact raised as a deeply religious girl, that she would be so careless about sleeping with a gentile after knowing him for 5 minutes.some good things about the film : at least she didn't end up pregnant, not knowing who the father was... the whole description of life in the jewish community in london is good

the governess is a moody period piece, the meandering story of a jewish woman who, upon the death of her father, sets out to 1830's scotland, posing as a gentile to get work to support her family in london.rosina - or mary, as she calls herself in a none too subtle piece of symbolic writing - is a rudderless child, a socialite with dreams of being an actress. she strikes up an alliance with her employer, and by accident solves a crucial problem in his research with photography. giddy with success, they begin a halting and uncomfortable affair while the eldest son of her paramour falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with her.and like a child, she fails to understand the consequences of her actions - in the end, betraying those she deceived in order to make a life for herself.many claim this is something of a feminist manifesto, but i disagree. whether intended or not, this film only resonates with me if i think of it as a cautionary tale. in the end, rosina's greatest disappointment is the truth - that she lied, happened upon a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover, and in the end contributed nothing but destruction. as such, the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one she used, made her happy - and that is exactly as it should be.did i need a movie this long and langorous to teach me this lesson? not at all. on the contrary, had it not been for excellent cinematography, unique score and my hope that she'd get her come-uppance, i wouldn't have stuck with it to the end of the film.fans of minnie driver will likely be disappointed by her uneven performance but may wish to see it anyway; i doubt young female fans of jonathan rhys-meyers will be able to stay awake for the payoff they expect, and i can't help thinking this holds too little cultural detail to be of interest, even to photography buffs. the 3 points i award the film are solely for its visual style and score. on the strength of their other work, i assume the actors' performances are so disappointing because of a poor script and worse directing, but they are, in the end, unremarkable.

the governess was, by far, a very pitiful film. i do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. i finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  "why"? honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. there were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation. scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending. it was as if i was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution. actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved. this was my biggest issue with this film. the complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine "ripple-effect" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film. i would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it. it made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all. minnie driver was the worst culprit of this deed. her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent. she would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time. she has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement. it nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with rosina and her sister. she is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention? that was confusing and completely random. is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent. anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching cavendish's daughter anything. the sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between driver and jonathan rhys-meyers nearly had me laughing out loud. i thought maybe i had discovered some magic in this film as rhys-meyers literally "poofed" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama. it felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts). well, it didn't fool me, i saw that he was nearly a "cut-and-paste" character used to strengthen an already weakened story. don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story. again using the "cut-and-paste" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to. it is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character  but i guess that is the name of the game in hollywood. fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.the remainder of the story was unexciting dribble. there were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to grandma about. more family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as i stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation. what may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film i felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me. wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (i will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes  eeewwww). also, she wore the same dress everyday. that was disgusting and i could smell her through the television. sex and dirty laundry. now there is a great film for you! there just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish. nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful. i cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation. i don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation. just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that i used. if you were as confused about that as i was, then you will completely understand the film the governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal  then, maybe this film is for you!grade: * out of *****

i'm really amazed that this got an 88% on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars. the 7.3 rating on imdb... that's not so much of a surprise, seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently. i just can't get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted, and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. which, it turns out, actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan. the far-fetched and over-dramatized mongol often echoes the likes of 300, a film that couldn't be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, mongol takes itself seriously. it's stoic seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, is what makes it truly the most boring film i've seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie i've ever seen. the characters were pathetically written. honestly, i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film. which is funny to me, because if there's anything that i'd think should be changed for the sake of theatricality, it's making a boring person into an interesting person. the romance between khan and borte is similarly boring, simple, and stupid. also, without giving anything away, mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time- where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the film just skips forward without any explanation. it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing. (did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself?) meanwhile, it drags like no film i've ever seen before. even now, i could swear it was three hours long. about 45 minutes into it, i checked the time, being pretty certain that it was almost finished. besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano (naturally), mongol is honestly just a disaster. it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway. i would never give this film a second chance. and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day. at least then i know what i'm getting, unlike with mongol, where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeing.the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know, without a doubt, would simply love it.

the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months. the plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. the jokes where really poor. the narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about mongolian history, traditions etc. my co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost. i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all. it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end.

the narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story i think i've seen disguised in a slew of other films. i never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top. the one redeeming quality was the photography- the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film, unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story- i left unmoved, and disappointed..

i was waiting for this movie for a time. in the first day of the air in turkey, i watched it. it was totally a disappointment for me. i was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. first of all, the main character of the movie cengiz han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. you can not feel the power in the movie. historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years. to do that, cengiz first unite the asian tribes. however, in the movie, this loser man is in one scene poor-alone man, and in second scene, he is commanding armies. war scenes were incredibly week. in the final battle, the mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy. : ) as a consequences, me and my friends just laugh at that scenes. mongol army means mongol archery horseman. you can not see that in the movie. another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. i do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed cengiz as a prophet. we can say in the integrity of the movie, it is acceptable. however, the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of cengiz khan after cengiz gave him a mission is really funny. when the monk died in the desert, cengiz's wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent. we are talking about the asia again we laughed. there are a lot of more things to say but, i don't feel that this movie has value to talk more.

i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time i checked ghengis khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! awfully acted - i found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth! a saving grace of the film was the cinematography. that is why i gave this film a 2 star-rating rather than the bare minimum! however, if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead! all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money! please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss!

as a genghis khan "fan" i was looking forward to this movie. after devouring conn igguldens epic novels about genghis and reading up on loads of historic records i feel i know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...that turned out a deception. this movie is practically made up from beginning to end. there are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. that does not have to be a problem, i like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring. nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie.i would not recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject.

have seen this movie today. very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist. the most sad things are:1. it's very slow. 2. how ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. we see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. click! - the very next second he's leading the huge army, without any reasons to be a leader. 4. the magic of ghengis-khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf/god/whoever it was. 5. can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years? 6. is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies? does ridley scott know that way? 7. why after 20-30 years khan's mother doesn't look older? 8. what is the motivation for the main character? (none. literally.)don't waste your time. really. cinematographers's work is good; the nature is outstanding - but the movie cannot be made without director and script. the real ghengis-khan would execute director in a second.kind regards.

i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. two hours and six minutes long, it is. it's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. there's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. however the writers fluffed it completely. we get no real history. we get instead a hollywood version of history.what sustains young temudjin through his long -- almost endless, actually, or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? why, the love of a good woman, of course.how does he get out of prison? well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises temudjin's love for her, dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there, talisman in his hand. and of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, rescues him.how does he escape from the shackles? well, he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god tengri (or some such name) and tengri sets him free by magic. yeah, right.why does he want to become ruler of the mongols? the wolf-god again, apparently. off goes temudjin to ask for guidance, and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. "laws," he says to himself. "what the mongols need are laws. good, simple ones." golly, it was impressive.and then finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? better tactics, certainly, but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. all the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (mongols are scared of thunder, you see) -- but not our temudjin. the troops, completely wowed by his bravery, acclaim him king! i don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. the funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. it's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.there's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings, impalings, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time, actually. despite the realism, it's impossible to take seriously.i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene. how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. they don't. oh, and it's all shot in the standard hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. and the standard dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.tedious.avoid.

first of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of mongolian music. well, the horses looked mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was mongolian in it. oh, borte is played by a mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. but she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.but, i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by mr.bodrov. the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion. there was no logic behind the development of the plot. in fact, there was hardly any story at all, just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in "mongolian" clothes, speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian. most actors were either japanese, russian or chinese, most scenes were shot in china, kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a "mongolian". the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow. the battle scenes are laughable. all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story.the japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. he looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie.and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. to see chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave, to see his two first kids be born from other men, to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant... my blood starts to boil. and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha? one could make a great movie out of it. where is the story of the rise of temujin? of his childhood, of his relationship with his family, with his brothers, of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family? where is van khan, who helped him a lot? where is the depiction of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relations with the other nations around them?where is development of the characters? we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important, how temujin became chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.

first off, i'm a huge bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. i watched every film he made on the big screen since "love and bullets", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, hollywood-blockbuster star.i kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. and i don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio cannon and hack director j. lee thompson for most of his latter films."assasination" gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed. first off, the film looks incredibly cheap, like it was made for about 3 mil, minus bronson's inflated salary (i heard he insisted on 5 mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films). the white house scenes were filmed on the va grounds in west la - i was taking the bus when they were shooting. nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots? guess not.secondly, the supporting cast is really bad. ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she's not bad but the horrible asian woman playing bronson's sidekick was typical of cannon's talent at the time --non-existent. i would be real curious to learn how she got this role. i can't imagine a worse actress for the part, plus she's a good 40 years younger than bronson! the story is not that bad and it's something that bigger and better-budgeted studios did later (eastwood's "in the line of fire" and costner's "bodyguard" film) but the way it's staged here is really sad. i'm wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot. none of it is believable in the slightest. if secret service men really behaved like the keystone cops in this movie we'd have presidents rotating out of office (and out of life) every few months...

i can't believe i sat through this garbage. palm trees in d.c. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that i thought it was supposed to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. i think it's a shame that jill ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. don't waste your time - i wish i hadn't. the only saving grace is that it was on cable, so i didn't waste my money on top of everything.

bronson and ireland, in their last film together, make a likable pair. he is more restrained than usual and she has become a winning actress. but as a thriller the film is totally worthless. its premise is downright silly and its pace is much too rushed.

in the twilight years of his career, charles bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably j. lee thompson and michael winner. he did two films for one-time bond director peter hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner death hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like the wilby conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles). bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian, whose assignment is to protect the american president's wife, lara royce craig (jill ireland, real-life wife of bronson). killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins; she thinks he's an over-protective, paranoid pessimist. turns out - surprise, surprise - that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her. the pair of them go on the run, pursued by the assassins. everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady. for some reason, in this film they have renamed her "one mama"! quite what the point of this is is anybody's guess, but it's indicative of the film's pointlessness as a whole. most of the film's performances are lazy, and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it's going. if i had to label assassination within a specific genre, i'd say it is supposed to be a "thriller". i'd say that with some reservations, however, as to say that it's a thriller it has precious few thrills.

this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband david mccallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with charles bronson. it is a great irony that bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history.'assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into cannon's production schedule for the sake of bronson and ireland. ireland was already suffering from cancer-related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do 'just one more, for old times' sake.' 'assassination' is carelessly done as a whole, showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank cannon by 1990. but there's a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is hollywood.bronson plays jay killian, a high-ranking secret service agent who is assigned to protect the first lady, lara craig (ireland). the president's wife has a reputation for being difficult, bossing service agents around and wanting to do things her own way. that all changes, however, when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with killian by car, train, motorbike, and believe it or not, dune buggy to escape would-be assassins. there is little surprise here, as killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job, perhaps arranged by the president himself. on the way, killian and mrs. craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between bronson and ireland that are actually very funny.what really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it's still made to look as a dvd. the original trailer gives you the feeling that 'assassination' is another cold-hearted bronson shoot-'em-up. but a lot of this movie - which was rated pg-13, by the way - is in a comic vein, putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like bronson and ireland's western 'from noon till three.' even the dvd case shows bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow things up. which he does, but to a lesser degree than his other '80s potboilers.on the whole, 'assassination' is late cannon slop work and doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be. besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again, there are serious mistakes in continuity, property values are bottom-of-the-barrel cheap, and the effects are dreadful; many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location. robert ragland, who had shown good composing skills in earlier films, teamed up with valentine mccallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for television.richard sale's script has real lulus of dialogue, with the conversations between bronson and ireland the only bright spot. there is no explanation as to why the first lady is called 'one momma' all of a sudden, nor as to why ireland is left with her british accent when the character is a wyoming native. jan gan boyd, playing killian's main assistant, has a kitten-like personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent. stephen elliott (a former tony award nominee who died in may 2005), randy brooks, erik stern (as assassin bracken), and michael ansara (senator bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles.incidentally, this was the last film directing gig for peter hunt, who broke onto the scene with 'on her majesty's secret service' in 1969 and collaborated with bronson and lee marvin on 'death hunt' in 1981. 'assassination' is available on dvd through mgm home entertainment; it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three-language subtitles and theatrical trailer.** out of 4

i watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which winona ryder and susan sarandon starred. but this one, it's just awful. oh my god, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister, and making amy the 3rd one. and jo interpretation, terrible, jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl. and what's with the laurie going to war?. i'm ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made, but not re-write the whole story. very very bad done.

after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie. i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not female oriented movies. this probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. i thought the acting was a bit over the top, but that is very common in movies of this era. june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven. there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments. i hate writing negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. it has always been my intention to read the book, but after this that seem unlikely. the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister, that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. again there are others who love this movie, i'm just not one of them.

has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? it makes me think less of a film that does that, showing a definite want of creativity. in all fairness, i tend to be biased in favor of katharine hepburn, but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism. the 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music, and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version. i don't understand the point of making the film again when the method of remaking it was to basically redo george cukor's film with everything the same except the people working on it.

it's a long time ago i saw this movie and still it's one of the worst i've ever seen. i like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. not a combination of two. this could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. i didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. i didn't know it was such a crap. i loved the first part, in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'nightmare on elmsteet'. if you like horror, watch a real horror movie. and when you love bloodstolling thrillers don't watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.

this film is simply appalling, how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief.iguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea,i feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me.harvey kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires.i would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies ,you wont miss a thing.the humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate, movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you.as deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.

warning:i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film. i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. first, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where i just wanted to turn it off. i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on, but i guess i had hopes that it would get better.... then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind, in a very bad way. i thought,"okay this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals, then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning, in like, the last 30 minutes?" to add on to that, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not; a bunny would've been more intimidating than these characters! this movie is a horrible piece of crap!!! from dusk till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, disheartening thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film. i do not understand how george clooney, quentin tarintino, cheech marin and danny trejo, all being the good and honorable actors that they are, could take part in this useless filth. in my opinion, from dusk till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on. do not see it, you'll be doing yourelf a great favor...

i love dissing this movie. my peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. here's some huge reasons why: a: the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. b: that untalented juliette lewis is in it. c: preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars, brothers with the last name "gecko," bad vampire make-up jobs, cheech marin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only fires when "erect" and belongs to a guy who goes by "sex machine." if robert rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence, i might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. the whole project's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother. i swear i think they thought it up right then and there. this movie's out to offend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. horrible movie.

what could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! the last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! the acting talents of the likes of juliette lewis and harvey keitel (not to mention george clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie. the director... robert rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks including el mariachi, desperado, once upon a time in mexico, and the very recent sin city ... really holds your attention with the well executed first half ... which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness starts ... there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy ... truly exasperating!!

just what is the point of this film? it starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. screenplay by tarantino, direction by rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it. but it doesn't quite work that way. you're only good while you continue doing good things. there are so many questions to ask: just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. but, of course, we never do. and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. that's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). on every level  except the technical  this film stinks. avoid.

this was not a good movie!! why do you people keep saying that? there is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then bam vampires!!! why? why are there vampires? where did they come from? also, what the hell?! there are all of these "super human" vampires but george clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them. quickly too. it's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. there was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! the next thing you know, clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of mexico. end of story. literally. oh and the strip club was an aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern mexico not the border. why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie? do not rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. you will wish you had that time of your life back.

i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. i was intrigued for the first whole hour. it was shaping up to be a great thriller. a very talented cast and good dialogue.then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. i couldn't believe my eyes.a great thriller was flushed down the toilet. the rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.i gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. i think that's a little generous, but i was entertained for a while. i'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all.if you are, then you may disagree with my opinion.

it's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not well shot, you don't care about the characters, not one single one of them. there's nothing that engages you in the narrative flow, you really could care less what happens. big, big waste of time and talent.

i saw hurlyburly on broadway and liked it a great deal. i don't know what happened with the film version, because it was dreadful. perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen. anyway, i couldn't wait for this film to be over. the acting is universally over the top. only kevin spacey has it together, and he seems like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.

acting 10, script 1. "hurlyburly" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. while people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. we're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. the only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif anna paquin use the word "ain't."never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme, the camera work is plain sloppy and (for la residents) the attention to geography is laughable. (hint: the view out sean penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window, and you can't drive south through hollywood and wind up in glendale pretending to be burbank.) okay, suspension of disbelief and all that -- and normally i wouldn't pay attention to little things like that, because they are just vagaries of production. but, the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise -- the script.in short, skip this one, even on video. rabe picked the wrong quote from the scottish play for his title; hurlyburly would have been better named "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." a bit long for the marquee, perhaps -- but at least it would be honest advertising.

a complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. the entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. the tagline for this movie should have read "come see how f*cked up our characters are! they're stoned! they're coke addicts! they're a mess! who are these people? do you really care? does it matter? just give us your money please, because we sure don't care about anything else!" an absolutely terrible movie. it never went anywhere, you never got to know the characters (they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke), and it was just downright boring. you might like the movie a little more if you're a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us that aren't, this movie is a waste of film and of time.

i watched hurlyburly as a second choice after affliction was sold out. i have never seen so many people walk out of a movie. sean penn, kevin spacey, and chazz palminteri can do nothing to save this coke-snorting, endlessly pedantic, bad mamet-wannabe.

that's what i felt like yelling as well as stomping out of the theater, but i restrained myself. yes the acting was great, no this wasn't the typical hollywood film, but the dialogue just wouldn't end (or get interesting)! and despite all the gabbing, you never get to really know or care about any of the characters. definitely the most boring film i've seen since sphere, but i was expecting that one to be boring. i had to sit through it, but please, spare yourself

i sat (uncomfortably) through this film becoming more and more staggered at just how it got made at all. the script itself makes the acting look embarrassing, and it fundamentally becomes a waste of time for everybody concerned. if you avoid seeing one film this year, make it this one.

did someone find the plot somewhere in the film?. perhaps it is the thing missing in this pretentious exercise of cinema about cinema. it is quite surprising that gordon says that "a movie without a plot is nothing"... it is possible that characters have more to say that the own wim wenders. was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director?.

this film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.i was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of portugal which i have visited. it is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. that was the only good thing. the story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.a film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. well, a wait is a wait. i can wait for a number 15 bus on princes street in edinburgh, i can spend hours on a remote railway station in the middle of nowhere on cold winter's sunday afternoon. however a wait is boring and yes, this wait was boring too.so the leader goes off to america to remonstrate with the film supplier who castigates him for not making the whole thing in colour. after a number of arguments two blessed bullets ring out from wherever and the eagerly-awaited end finally arrives, and not before time.yes, i would see this film again if someone arms me with a couple of cans of colour film so that i can hurl them at the screen.

director delbert mann was a much better director than this film indicates. he directed all quiet on the western front, that touch of mink, and the last days of patton among others. this mediocre, made for television retelling of dicken's masterpiece is so bad, even those unfamiliar with the often filmed tale, will be unsatisfied.besides the fact that the movie is available from only two known suppliers (brentwood and bci eclipse llc) the poor quality of the transfer, and the scratchy and muddied sound track make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort.i have always believed that if a company is going to put a film on video and charge the public money to buy it, then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer. unfortunately neither of the two suppliers have such a work ethic and the result is only fit for the bargain bin in the local discount store.the story is told mainly through flashbacks, making the film episodic and talky. much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. the characters of martha, traddles and others have been cut and the relationship of young david and steerforth is not explored enough, so we are left wondering why david would hang out with the guy.the relationship between david the boy, and young agnes is never developed and it is hard to understand why she and david eventually marry. since martha is left out, it is a mystery how dan peggoty finds his niece. and the absence of traddles makes david a very lonely fellow.some have credited this film with doing a good job of abridging the lengthy novel. i disagree, this is at best a hatchet job on the book. anyone who has seen the 1935 george cukor version will agree.the performances in that version by fields as micawber and rathbone as murdstone, are definitely worth the trouble of watching it. and the more recent masterpiece theatre version (april 2000) and hallmark (2000) versions are both outstanding achievements in made for television adaptations of classic novels. directors simon curtis and peter medak who are responsible for those films are deserving of the highest praise.my final comment on david copperfield 1969 is don't buy it, there are several much better versions of the film available. if it is on television, turn the channel to something else. it is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life. sorry folks, but i can't praise such an appallingly bad film.

this version of david copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. i knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment attenborough and olivier camp it up as two baddies. it was all downhill after this. aunt betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.the worst of the worst was the producer's choice for uriah. this was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by roland young. and what was all this self-absorbed angst from david. dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer.this was one time when hollywood knew more than jolly old england.

one only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this david copperfield, but, alas, alas! how so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literature's richest tales into such a monumental bore, is totally beyond me. it's pretty to look at with lovely photography, particularly the yarmouth sequences, but, just plain dull!!! no need to go on! skip it and check out the selznick or the marvelous bbc mini-series from the 1980's.

as much as i love the story of david copperfield, i cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen. one problem i see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. it is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. i dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. it was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp. also, i don't think the filmmakers interpreted copperfield's personality correctly. the idea of him strolling around on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive, forward-thinking nature dickens gave him in the novel. agnes also bothered me. she came across as a ditsy household decoration, rather than a strong woman. dora was perfect, however. this movie was fraught with problems, and i wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version.

while killing time on a saturday morning, "looking for lola" came on hbo. i decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. it was even worse than i could imagine. the movie was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no on-screen chemistry between the lead actors that i found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. between mike greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes in which he skips the bill at a fancy restaurant and where lola (lead actress) allows him to use her boss' house to fool his parents into thinking he's rich, it was almost as bad as him "daydreaming" about people around him doing the macarena (it was horrible!) and the two actors ultimately falling in love. i kept wanting to change the channel, but i was trying to give it every chance into becoming a cute love story with a few chuckles. it never did. in fact, it became so bad that i decided to finish it just so i can claim that i watched one of the worst films ever made in it's entirety, instead of being criticized for not "giving it a fair chance". the last scene where lola tries out for a dance part was the culmination of the movie. she comes in late after getting married (even that scene where mike tells the priest to hurry up and then just snatches the papers away claiming that it's done was in tune with the believability of this movie), and then somehow "convinces" the judges to give her a look. the two male judges are already put-off with how late she is. but after watching her waif around the stage (ok, she dances fine, but not overly impressive), everybody joins in including lola and mike's families, other dancers that were there, and *cough* even the judges. bad, horrible, terrible. it was so bad i had to write a review. watch at your own risk.

this movie was so frustrating. everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time. i at least thought i'd be able to stand it. but, i was wrong. first, the weird looping? it was like watching "america's funniest home videos". the damn parents. i hated them so much. the stereo-typical latino family? i need to speak with the person responsible for this. we need to have a talk. that little girl who was always hanging on someone? i just hated her and had to mention it. now, the final scene transcends, i must say. it's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. what crappy dancing. horrible and beautiful at once.

james marsh's the king is a film that mystifies me. i can't think what its meant to be for. it's a story about a young man called elvis played by gael garcia bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years navy service and then goes off to find his biological father and behaves dishonourably with him and his family. it's all rather sick really. elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister malerie (pell james). it's rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in middle england. preacher father and bouncy joyful christian congregation; i couldn't work out whether the film is meant to be deriding them for their mindless beliefs. or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that's unviable. or is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction. it's shallow. we all know that bad things happen; the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever unravelling the thinking that has led to it. "the king" is such a lost opportunity. there are some really interesting questions about honour; the warrior code; the changing concepts of valour; honour killings in indian families and so on. honour is a very varied concept. but this film just adds nothing to the notion. however, paul the projectionist did more than his meagre role suggests. the dvd projector showed all films in a green-only hue and the only way to repair this was to get it sent to belgium. he did this through christmas. i think those postal workers and repairers and paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dismal film. but you might see it differently?

i am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of christian fundamentalism.that said, this movie is reprehensible, vile and transparent. it only works on the level of the currently fashionable (and tired) hatred motif of white american christian fundamentalism. had this movie been made about a fundamentalist jewish or muslim family, or even a black christian family, the outrage would have been palpable, and the movie would have been roundly panned in all circles. as it stands, though, it's "ok" and "artful" because white christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage such as this.and garbage it truly is. if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent, find and watch or review "badlands." nothing good was done in "the king" that wasn't done better decades ago in that masterful film.as other reviewers note, the characters are almost completely undeveloped in "the king," the lines are a snooze, the cinematography is lackluster. we've seen the tale of the sociopath done better 100 times. this movie doesn't cut it for thoughtful viewers.

if you are an insomniac and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie. if you are renting it for whatever other reason....dont!....this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen. the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason. i cant even write about this movie anymore...get it away from me!!!!!!!!

negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. everyone in this movie should attend overactors anonymous. you would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the pearl harbor bombing. it does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. the typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included). i could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and cliché characters. upon the completion of the movie, i had to throw the dvd in the trash. stay far away from this dud! you won't get the 90 minutes of your life back!

i'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. i do not connect with any of the characters. this is a problem for a documentary. that disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. although because of the poor story flow, i'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. the story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on. the 3rd founder that takes them for $700k is introduced so late into the film, khaleil and tom have to backpaddle (fruitlessly) to explain "oh yeah, this guy created the idea too". and just when i thought i had a slight grasp on who all the tertiary characters were, some crazy woman in ranting about getting a puppy? what's up with that? also, did tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff? i can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening. actually i think i feel for them.

i didn't care much for this, it seemed too contrived for a documentary. also, the filmmakers seemed to steer me towards certain characters, and yet i was completely unsympathetic towards the protagonist because of what they chose to show me of him.this movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, yet the movie fell flat because of snappy editing that didn't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene. the developments in the story were glossed over in lieu of showing the men in boxers or other stuff that was incidental to the tale that they were telling.i'd recommned that you skip this one and just read up on this story.

this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen. it looked so amateurish. chris hegedus was one of the directors of the war room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. the quality was so pitiful that i couldn't stand watching it. i saw about 30 minutes or so and i had to take it back to blockbuster and get something else. i can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like chris hegedus. how the hell did this win any awards to begin with??? the war room definitely deserved an award, as did another great documentary called ameragosa (both won awards). this documentary looked like it was done by uncle joe who also does weddings on the weekends. shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, bad sound, a 10 year old could make a better film than that guy did.

the ten steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. the dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in irish short films. really really embarrassingly bad. the girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. she telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. the mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as dad is 'trying to impress his boss'. the actress playing the boss's wife very successfully emulates the mother's poor acting when she tells them that their house is haunted. the rest of the film consists of the father coaxing his daughter down the stairs on the telephone. the ten steps employs the stock techniques in camera movement, lighting and music that one would expect in a below average horror film. poor.

rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (john beal) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. tcm aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of joan fontaine.fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and john beal is okay as her love interest. but it's obvious that philip huston (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine. whatever happened to this handsome actor? why didn't rko promote him, along with fontaine? he showed skill as a light comedian.these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title. the story itself is rather tiresome, only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine's spirited heroine.she photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully, suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date. beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. strictly lackluster.but whatever happened to philip huston? evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career.trivia note: watch for dwight frye (of "dracula") as the out of control patient aboard the airplane.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. if i wasn't watching it for free, i would have never finished it. the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. it seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of scary movie and date movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. the only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. a guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. none of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie ever. the plot (or lack thereof) is completely retarded. the plot seems to center around the coach and his family, however there are so many other things going on in the movie it is completely ridiculous. terrible, terrible movie.

back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick, i also saw drumline that day. drumline wins by default! if the comebcaks had been released in march (as planned) the same time tmnt was released, tmnt would've won by default! granted, matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback. he didn't have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus. but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl's boob, those were the minuses.but the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video, except matthew lawrence (insert the price is right's losing horns)! another blown musical opportunity for him, just because he's shy about doing music.in the past, matt has disappointed me many times (super human samurai syber squad) where he came so close to having a musical moment, but ended up failing.sure, joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and andrew's starting a music career of his own. but it's very rare to find a matt musical moment. the two that stand out would be on brotherly love where he played the guitar and sang "pigeon on your car" (art atrack), which he wrote by the way, and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang "this dame" (as time goes by).matt, you've played jocks too long. why not make a musical comeback. you have a good voice and i miss your musical side.

we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition, which was our intention, and 'the comebacks' was the only film that hadn't already started. i had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter. the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started.the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports cliché at the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the entire movie. think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned. if you add texas to the mix,you ought to come up with the sports version of 'little miss sunshine', not a big yawn.the first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was 'can't stop the music' by comparison, this was 'can't stop the music' without bruce jenner, valerie perrine, or the village people.if the film had a single grace note, it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up.

the worst movie i have ever seen. the sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...i first tought: "oh no, i don't want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer". but this turned out to be even worse. typically in this american film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. the audience isn't involved. and now, when i don't get any hints at all, you can expect a several 's/he-is-the-killer' sweeps in the end. and that is not all. ah... this is hopeless, lets make an end to it...in one word: disgusting..

it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe differed from the one circulating in the us.anyway, this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years. (closely followed by the waterboy...)why: because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it.(examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends. the "grumpy" officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class. there´s a buddy-moment which comes out of nowhere at the end. there´s an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone.)if you want to see a smart movie: see memento. if you want to see a better thriller: see any thriller that comes to mind. if you want to see patrick swayze: see dirty dancing.

this movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script, which was mostly used up in the beginning. after that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through. the movie followed a descending curve from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it concluded. it's not recommended.

we get to see who the good guys are. the union. and who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. the filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. all the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. this is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. the plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. it's boring and pointless. the narration by star keach is really bad. and a good actor, don stroud, overacted to the hilt, playing the guy no one likes, and who we aren't supposed to like. it takes a long time for this bore to take off, and for the title to assert itself; then when it does take off, it crashes a minute later. boring. one of the worst films ever made.

a real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for tv movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. stick to mike hammer. i find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. stacey keach is too soppy as lou ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies tv spin off, of planet of the apes. i thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of jim thompson novels though, actually the grifters isn't done too badly, thats one of his, starring jon cusak.

downhill racer is essentially, a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences. although there is a story here, robert redford's character, a skier trying to make the u.s. olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all. gene hackman, in an early performance, adds nicely, but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off, and it wouldn't make much of a difference.

what this film has is its realism , you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style . however the problem is unless you`re a big fan of the sport there`s not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention .before anyone asks why i watched it , i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but that`s not really a good enough reason for watching

this is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. to borrow from the late douglas adams, "watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick.".what is wrong? everything. british actors posing as americans, there have been many that can pull it off like bob hoskins but he isn't in this one. it wasn't even necessary to choose north america as a location why not say it took place in england or something? the director seemed to like taking shots of girls tits and asses more than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation. so at this point you drunken buddies will be saying, "all right! another t&a shot!". there isn't much dialog so feel free to skip off to the kitchen and make those sandwiches. what did i like about this movie? after my friends passed out, i managed to collect $185 off of them and told them they spent it at the strip bar after we finished watching the awful movie.

the trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised: good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads! if you were expecting a major hollywood movie with major stars, stellar budgets, and mpaa tamed money shots, you will be *very* disappointed.however, if you are a fan of the old "b" movies with unknown, but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well, given the material, some hokey, but surprisingly well done special effects, and very tight naked nubile bodies, this movie is almost heaven!

your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.unlike most hk actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. when they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. the dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of maggie cheung, brigitte lin, and a roll-call of hk's top acting talent chewing up the scenery. as with some of wong kar-wai's early work, the dialog could be more precise. in short, the ashes of time requires a forgiving attitude. released around the same time as wong kar-wai's spectacularly successful chungking express, it's clear that the director isn't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film. anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed. but those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least.

the direction by wong is perhaps the all time worst in film history i've ever seen. this film makes my all time worst film of 2000, dungeons and dragons by courtney soloman looked like an oscar winner. the flaws in this movie is beyond explanation. the biggest one is the lack of depth. every scene does not develop fully as if the editing room doesn't know how to do their job correctly. its a shame that with such an all-star cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of vision.i am so disgusted and hope that some great director like john woo or ang lee, decide to remake this film and do some justice. i'm not even sure if i can rate 0/10??

disclaimer: during my ventures into foreign cinema, i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. thus, i have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films. with a wide array of chinese, japanese, and korean movies under my belt, i am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. unfortunately, ashes of time has nothing to recognize. it is one of the worst chinese movies i have ever seen.to start off, this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous "slideshow" action sequence throughout, which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. one simply needs to show a series of close-up pictures of grimising faces, swords, legs and/or arms, and then a dead body. bravissimo! you now have an action sequence for ashes of time. the problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on.the dramatic element of this film is nonexistent, as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen, which renders all characters generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. in fact, the storyline itself is an absolute disaster, introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices. plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously (i.e., a tale of two sisters), but ashes of time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reason.in fact, this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies. horrible action choreography is covered up by "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movements. non-existent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel. and a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolution.as if this weren't bad enough, this movie was extremely boring, seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95.rating = a rarely given 0/5 stars.

as i sit back after watching wong kar-wai's 1994 movie ashes of time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'redux' slapped on the end of the title  i wonder what went wrong. i wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. in particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?well it's not too hard to figure out really. let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar-wai so abruptly went down this hell-hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express, one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film. so  what went wrong? it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film. our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film-making and places it in an entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out. hence, it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment. bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure nonetheless.let me elaborate. those who have seen the films of mr. kar-wai, a hong kong-born film auteur who's made his mark on the art-house world since his debut in the late-80's, will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together; essentially and frankly speaking, they're all colourful, thought-provoking, amiable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. the same formula is transposed into ashes of time; however, the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of, and in its stead we're placed into the setting of ancient china, and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen.intertwined into this quasi-adventure/historical caper is the typical kar-wai love story, this time involving an elegiac hit-man who has moved to the middle of the desert, and is carrying out contract killings. however, i must stop myself there; description of characters is a useless thing to do. why? because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing. what a bland cast, and what a waste of talent (the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar-wai collaborators).not only that, but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous, almost non-existent narrative structure. one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever, let alone a semblance or an indication of one. you can definitely see what they're getting at, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the film. perhaps it's just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar-wai's typical film-making style. i like to think, however unfortunate it may be, that mr. kar-wai just stuffed up big time here.one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time, albeit said compliment being starkly isolated, is another director trademark  wonderful, colourful and blissful aesthetics. what joyous colour is composed on-screen, what glorious textures are painted for us, and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie. we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar-wai is still there at heart, and it's just the film which is so atypical, and buries his usually commendable nuance. although the visuals aren't enough for us to fully absolve kar-wai for this disastrous venture, they're enough to make the film worthwhile  and at least we don't walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood, now that there's something we can think of nicely.the film is essentially a 'wuxia art' film, following in the style of, say, legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa. however, one thing differentiates kar-wai's film from kurosawa's best, and that's that in the japanese director's films everything gels together and simply works. in ashes of time, nothing seems to work. kar-wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms, is a futile endeavour.kar-wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him, and that he needed time to clear his head. it must've certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf, as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly  i mean, just watching the film is an exhausting effort, and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie-going experience.

"ashes of time" was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie. this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. the plot of "ashes of time" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: "love triangle". because of those "love triangles" crossing stories, jealousy, hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. the narrative part is seen through ou-yang feng's eyes (leslie cheung). ou-yang feng lives in the desert, where he acts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved. unfortunately "ashes of time" fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate. wong kar-wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors (men and women) everything else is a failure in this movie. dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. picture's quality is very much unequal, the editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least by me) in the "swordplay" genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing. even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so call erotic "women on a horse" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. wong kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told. by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective.

recap: a lone swordsman, living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen, recollects how his life turned out to be as it is. it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead, causing him to leave his home town. one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister. but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected, and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person.comments: i've seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994. how the two versions differ i can't say, but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action. that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. a comprehensible story. but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong. therefore there are lots of colorful, very beautiful scenes, that are completely unrelated to the story.the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled. much is left out in the scenes, the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights, only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated. the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie.thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the movie is put into the action genre. the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing. only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action, the other couldn't be farther away from it. the movie in its entirety is very slow, dull and hence very boring. not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie.i might say that i'm not a fan of this chinese style, since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems, most importantly that the visual is more important than the story, but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i've seen.3/10

no that its sick. it's not sick. it made me want to puke because i spent 2 dollars on it. its boring, retarded, and annoying. i didn't see the mst3k version, which sucks because i bet the mst3k version was funny. it's sad that people waste money on these kinds of movies. i'm surprised its not on the "100 worst movies of all time list".tromadude's rating- 0 outta ***** stars

ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and steve a-lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. steve's rendition of a dying cat during his "i love what i know" serenade had me vomiting for hours. bike chick linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying. "you messin' wit private stock." this is scriptwriting folks.i liked the ending. what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! you have to see this to detest it.die jeter, die!!!

not really all that much to this movie...either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady, offer him a job, he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go!!! what plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them. i am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end, but hey it is a bad movie, you always get scenes that make little sense. i am still trying to figure out if i misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver. they may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and i wouldn't think it would be all that uncommon for a stunt car to crash. the actors are bad, and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent...really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the pits.

this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. he meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. the group which is called satan's angels, wants rod, the driver, as their personal driver. he says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. they rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene. the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on. she says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how. she then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him. the other three in the gang (excluding rod) run into the store. they take everything off the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on christmas day.this movie surely wastes no precious screen time with a plot.

wild rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating due to the actual good, or at least workable, elements in the story. it deals with a race car driver (steve alaimo) who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called satan's angels, who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank. meanwhile alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they'll rob next. it's not even that the film is really too 'dated', though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film (from the band on stage in one scene, to alaimo "performing" if you could call that drek that, to the regular generic score). it's just that there's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic, direction, and better actors for the parts. as it is i didn't have a major disliking towards the film, as i did with the hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all, too. what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town ('citrusville' ho-ho). so it's not completely un-worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late. the commentary is good on the movie, even if once or twice i almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth. wild rebels might be more of a good time if you've got a six-pack and low expectations, but as it is i wouldn't watch it again.

legendary pop star steve alaimo ("don't let the sun catch you crying") stars as an unlikable stock car racer whose career has hit the skids (ha ha) because he constantly crashes his car (or as he laments, "i'm tired of being run down by every grease monkey that gets behind the wheel"). he falls into a bad crowd of humorously inept nazi bikers, improbably named jeeter, banjo, fats, and, er, linda. fats is the most likable of the bunch; he took a surfboard to the back of the skull and now only communicates through grunts, sort of a harley davidson leatherface.anyway, steve is fooled by the cops into catching the dastardly crooks in the middle of one of their bank robberies. the gang only robs banks for "kicks, man". i guess they give the money to charity. steve fails constantly, the bikers get greasier, and the whole thing never comes off as daring because it's so dull. this movie looks like it was filmed through a grease-soaked paper towel. not since "necromantic" has a movie so trampled my soul.the guy who played fats went on to direct "deranged", the ed gein biopic starring robert blossom.anyway, in summary: wild rebels: hilarious on mst3k, dreadful everywhere else.

oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!to think that films such as this were made, and probably enjoyed by thousands at drive-ins really boggles the mind. how innocent we were in those days.to put it bluntly, this film is crap. the hero is so wet you can hear his squishy damp footsteps in every scene. my lord, but he's just one of a whole slew of awful, awful actors that appear in this turkey. no wonder mst3k picked it. the story, such as it is, centres around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe it is the actor driving the car) that he gives up and "gets in with the wrong crowd" oooooh! scary stuff. however, the wrong crowd turn out to be the biker equivalent of the three stooges and their "hand-me round" slut of a biker chick. as an example of how lame this whole thing is, the writers obviously wracked their brains to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang - if four people can be called a gang, that is. the result? the gang is called satan's angels! i kid you not.such dire acting and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make for a wonderful beer and chips movie. but otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish.as i said. once, this may have been considered good. but today it just makes you laugh (and cringe) with every minute that goes by. avoid it except for a good laugh. and make sure you're more than half-drunk too!

i completely forgot that i'd seen this within a couple of days, which is pretty revealing in itself. the umpteenth version of gaston 'phantom of the opera' leroux's locked-door country-house mystery, i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update. so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene, but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying.as a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience: like the worst agatha christies, it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to. as a film, be it comedy or thriller, the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non-existent. with the exception of the killer, everyone is a face-value version of the typical suspects in the typical country-house murder story - reporter, endangered heiress, suspicious fiancé, scatterbrained scientist father (a surprisingly poor michel lonsdale), etc. there's no depth and little of interest, and the frequently over-ripe or misjudged performances don't help. you frankly don't care about anyone in it, so there's no jeopardy or suspense. only claude rich and, in the last reel, pierre arditi get anything to work with, and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective.for the rest, we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would-be comic set pieces (a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off), with dennis podalydes reduced to irving the explainer for the last third of the picture. i'm not fond of country-house movies or agatha christie style whodunits, so those who are might cit it a lot more slack, but i found it a poor show. as rich says when the mystery is revealed, "it's all rather something of a disappointment."

a few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the "godzilla" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like "the loch ness horror". and, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! we open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits. this is, of course, to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the scottish highlights and not in director larry buchanan's birthplace texas. for that exact same reason, the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents. the american marine biologist prof. george sanderson arrives in loch ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake. meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, like a group of kids on a science camp (what a boring way to spend your vacation), retired army generals looking for a luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during wwii and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are steeling the monster's egg. you would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot, but unfortunately that's not the case. "loch ness horror" is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements. the monster itself, for example, is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. his teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night. near the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was about time to wrap it up. "loch ness horror" is carefully recommended in case you're a fan of bad b-movies from the 80's, but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget.

what can i say about a movie as bad as this? the people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. you never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over! i couldn't believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in. other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes, there isn't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle. still, it's watchable if you like this sort of trash. i know i do....

i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.i haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so i really can't say that much about it. it still seems to be very hard to find on video. but i remember my brother and i stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night uhf channel television of the mid 1980s when i was about 10 years old. so i've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but i saw most of it. the first thing i remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they're rowing to an island to make out, and then they get attacked by an insane scotsman in a kilt with an axe! they manage to escape from him but get attacked by the loch ness monster, which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body. the eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move, it looks like a piñata.i mean i had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind. i had seen some bad movies on tv in the early 80s but i had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it. i had already seen some of the troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be "campy", but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film-making. this movie was like the last gasp of the drive-in era and i caught a whiff of it just in time. actually when we were watching it, we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s. turns out it came out just a few years before i saw it.later i came into contact with mystery science theater and found out about a lot of the old b movies and serials, but i had already seen it in this movie. the movie is so funny that i had never even laughed that hard at the monty python crew or bill murray or any comedian. after seeing this movie i was always trying to search for the "good bad" movies and i got a lot of my friends into it. but this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find. i never really found out what it even was or who larry buchanan was until the 1990s when imdb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around. but this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. look for it.

omg, another bad film by larry buchanan. that guy did not learn to stop, did he? first, he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people, and now he is exploiting the loch ness monster as being vicious.the "plot" is basically about some southerners of the usa pretending to be scottish camping out at loch ness. alas, out on the fishing hole, oops, i mean lake of loch ness, there is a killer inflatable monster that clams itself to be nessie, going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason.i am surprised that the crew of mst3k never heard of this movie. yes, it is that bad too.

something strange is happening in loch ness. the water is crystal clear, nor cold. a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots! what is this movie?! first, i love reading stories about nessie, sea monsters in general. when i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. no. it was terrible! the story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical nessie they used. it was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything. not worth your while, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) you found it on. on second note, this film was shot in cailifornia, not loch ness, a major diss to nessie fans.

**possible spoilers ahead**whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of larry buchanan. this amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (zontar the thing from venus), cheap-jack crime dramas like a bullet for pretty boy, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like down on us and goodbye norma jean. the loch ness horror is a humdinger to say the least. overlooking the fact that loch ness is extremely long and narrow, larry filmed this howler on a wide and round california lake. early on, the film boasts some dazzling (for the budget) underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself. then it degenerates into windy dialogue uttered by no-name actors with lapsing scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipe. at one point, campers sing "you take the high road, i'll take the low road," just to throw in one more scottish cliche. if scottish people ever decide to jump on the political correctness bandwagon they'll sue larry buchanan over this film, his surname notwithstanding. the monster looks like a giant papier-mache puppet and it makes the dragon in beanie & cecil look terrifying by comparison. in one unforgettable scene nessie takes to land and, to evade some patrolling soldiers, the fifty-foot long critter tries to hide behind a tree-and the soldiers don't see it! the loch ness horror is a true mind-boggler that must be seen-several times--to be believed.

pick a stereotype, any stereotype (whether racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and i bet you'll find it in wassup rockers. do you think that all hispanic teenage boys are stupid, hairy, inarticulate, and dirty troublemakers? are hispanic girls sex-crazed, easy, ass-baring sluts? do black people all want to start fights and carry guns? do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? are all white teenage girls rich, stuck-up princesses who are bored with white teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous? if you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigot, and you will love wassup rockers.director larry clark likes to shock his audiences (i was 15 years old the first time i saw kids and i think that's why i'm still a virgin), but wassup rockers isn't shocking it's just bad. he tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body-hair close-ups, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic.simply put, wassup rockers is a teenage boy's fantasy. what 14-year-old boy doesn't want to be a skater who gets in trouble, crashes parties, drinks 40s, and is told by the hot, rich, white girl that his uncircumcised penis "looks dangerous?" besides that demographic, i really don't know who's going to enjoy this film.

it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids, bully, etc. but then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. who is the main character? is this a serious film or some gregg araki-esquire over the top goofy film? is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? i have no clue. i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. i cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the have's have not's. i got it way back in the beginning. kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends. wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. teenage caveman, which larry didn't write but did direct, was terrible. but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. wassup rockers was just plain bad.

there's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me. i'm not racist against latinos. hell, i'm half brazilian. i loved the movie kids. it doesn't make any sense. these kids just go around and do nothing. they're not even good at skating. the whole time i'm just waiting for something, anything, to happen! but it doesn't. nothing happens the whole movie. did i mention they suck at skating. i might make a movie called beat up rockers, and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids. i'm not even going to get into it, this movie sucks. please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake.

larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. kids, bully, and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. these films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. kids exposed us to the proliferation of a.i.d.s. and sexual promiscuity among the young. bully touched upon similar issues. ken park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. irrefutably, all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.wassup rockers is about a group of poor hispanic skateboarders from south-central las angeles who go to arbitrarily go to beverly hills to skate. that's it.wassup rockers is nothing.it has no substance. it has an essentially nonexistent narrative. and, like kids, it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting. however, unlike kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. there is better acting in porn. this film features, without a doubt, the most terrible performances i've ever seen in a feature film. one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process, but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy, folks. might i add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you'll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater, or you'll regret it afterward.but then again, it's not like they had much of a script to work with. every line that is uttered is a contrived, pathetically-delivered, and irritating beyond all measure. the story itself is ludicrous. it starts out reasonably enough, but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. this begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clichéd national lampoonish encounters, characters being killed off for no reason, and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. shots go on much longer than they need to. be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight, overlong, lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. but then again, with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. perhaps wassup rockers would have worked better as a short film.anyways, i could go on like this. this is the worst film larry clark has made yet. for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. this is by far the tamest film he's made yet, and it's also the worst. it's flat out horrible. like, uwe boll horrible. definitely the worst one i saw at the festival.1/10

i've never been a big larry clark fan, but somehow, i've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. now, i like independent films, and i grew up very much into punk rock, and i'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. not every punk song incorporates "oi!" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.but the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are "how kids really are," and as such, you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere, because that's the cinema verite feel he's going for. however, when he shoots a ridiculous death scene (pick any of them, save for the opening drive-by), the over-stylized attempts at what i assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (in most cases, far worse than a student film) and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story. john cassavettes and "date movie" make poor bedfellows, as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - a really, really bad one at that.

look, don't get me wrong i love independent films but come on! i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f***ing nightmare. i am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.i am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. please don't waste your precious time and money. i am sorry to be so harsh but come on! it dragged on and and on and on. remember when the kids got into that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis? how did they just blend in? it made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with whoever they wanted. i know im blathering but my mind is just buzzing with everything i hated about this film.

i recently had to watch this for a project in a sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie i have ever had to sit through. it was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the "good bits" taken out. bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.the female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. consider this exchange: "he's hot." "he has a girlfriend." "do you have a girlfriend?" "no." *girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes. boy comes out and sits next to other boy, girl saunters off* "did you hit that?" "no, i didn't want to take my pants off." "you're stupid." another girl shows up when the boys are going to beverly hills, gets in the trunk with one of the boys, and when they get pulled over by a cop, you see the car bobbing up and down.a homosexual pervert, a trigger-happy clint eastwood look alike, and what seems to be a luchador mask all add to the inanity. one of the boys gets caught by a cop, no one cares. one of the boys gets shot, no one cares.someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised, and it shows. just awful. i would never recommend this film to anyone.

that's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer's intelligence by losing track of time, plot, and reason for being produced.plus, how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in hollywood is beyond me.

ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist. this is one of them. this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. eddie deezen is just plain annoying as tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, don (william hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. tony, as i said, is an annoying little twit. this makes the whole movie a complete mess. the movie is terribly daffy. it's too cartoonish. the main point i'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness. it doesn't work that way. believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. if you don't take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. the thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody. you have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously. it also feels like they're just mocking woody allen, and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible.

if you liked william hickey in "prizzi's honor", he resurrects his character, as don anthony in "mob boss". this is a very weak "godfather" satire with few laughs. stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he's doing in this schlock-fest? morgan fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. eddie deezen vacillates between "three stooges" slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation. fatally flawed, "mob boss" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom, and numerous other nonsense. - merk

this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. i can't believe people actually a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a film c) actually expect it to be successful. words can't even describe how horrible this film is. i enjoy my fair share of teen movies, but this didn't even come close to being funny. in fact, it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible. i can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the film where i even managed to squeeze out a chuckle (other than the laughs regarding how bad it was).renting this was one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made. its been a day since i've seen the film, and i'm still in shock regarding how horrible it was. avoid at all costs.2/10

i could crap a better movie. this is a waste of time and money. it makes me sick that movies like these are actually getting made and the people making them actually think they're good. i happen to like teen comedies, when they're done well. this movie, however, takes this genre to a new low. with movies like this, people think it's actually okay to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it. it's sadism.

my mom brought me this movie on a dvd. a guy in a rental recommended it. but in fact, this might be the worst movie i've ever seen. you know, i didn't expect much from this film, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was senseless. i was looking forward to see christine lakin in this movie because i loved step by step. even she was a huge disappointment. the story was completely unreal. one of the party guys is dead (he wasn't dead in fact, he woke up later), the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. but then there comes a homosexual, policeman... there is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes??? come on, just be realistic at least. waste of money. really...

everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if i'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. in all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. good: the overall plot was mildly interesting. the music was overall pretty good. several of the songs (when you could hear them) were actually pretty cool. the only musical issues i had were: #1) the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to take away from the suspense), #2) the song being played when the lead characters went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and #3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while danny trejo hung a man (sounded like a pretty cool song, but it should have ripped out across the scene when danny trejo got froggy). now for the completely bad stuff: the script was atrocious. i mean, horrible. i've seen smoother dialogue in a star wars movie. advice to the writer from a part-time writer and full-time movie buff: when you write dialogue, ask yourself, "is this something that people would actually say?" honestly, the script was laughable. i want to slam the acting, but with that kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. the mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue. i know it was low-budget, but words don't cost money - if you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can pull it off. this movie didn't seem to have either, but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film.

this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak, but the acting was unbelievable bad, and at times pathetic. very unrealistic dialogs people in real life don't talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs. even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible. the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations. there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesn't have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to. how did this movie win/ get nominated for awards oh my god!!

wow, this movie really sucked down below the normal scale of dull, boring, and unimaginative films i've seen recently. the acting was poor and robotic. the story was so bland you could have summed it up with a simple 5-minute short. audio was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen to; perhaps it was unedited from the camera it was shot off of? i'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers were commenting on, but it wasn't this one. perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review, at least before the real reviews started to show up.save your time or you'll just be wasting your time and money on this film. absolute suckage!

don't get fooled by the 'awards' and the comment below. this is just 1 poor movie. the way george katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. the conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this. de in the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else. his emotions don't match with the things that happen in the film.the things he says as a voice-over doesn't add anything to the film. it just makes zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the clouds.the story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy. all parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors. let's hope jon rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.

this was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though i was watching a dvd, sometimes i couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). the plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script?), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?), the 'dark suits' gang (how original - couldn't think of a better name i guess), the drug dealer's hot girlfriend (gotta have a hot latina if your going to have la gangs i guess, but really...), etc etc can't believe i watched the whole thing.

return to sender, a.k.a. convicted, is almost imperfect. the one good thing about this particular film was that i was never bored. that being said, the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that i saw.rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work, i will simply comment that nothing works. there are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through. the acting in the film is not very good, although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by george lucas. there was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. did i mention that there were some plot holes? by the end of the movie, you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun, why kelly preston trusts aidan quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed, how aidan quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie, why aidan quinn didn't by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc.with all that being said, this is certainly a b-movie, and a terrible one at that. the unfortunate thing is that it just isn't bad enough to be good. if you value your time, please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one.

slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, timothy dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. i wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! but dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. this movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow. your time would be better spent watching mr. dalton in 1970's "wuthering heights" or the early 1980's bbc version of "jane eyre". poor sela ward, so lovely, but so wooden.... surely she's been better in other movies.

this is an adaptation of an edith wharton work, whose writing is amazing. sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation wharton's work depicts. ward and dalton aren't so bad, but alicia witt's wooden performance made me wince. she was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and i never believed a word out of her mouth. when she asks sela ward "why can't i move you?" near the end of the film, i couldn't help but answer: "that's what i've been wondering for the last hour and a half!!!"

the first shiloh film was enjoyable by adults as well as children. this one starts with about an hour of filler where not much happens, with stilted dialogue; only in the last act is there any significant action that really moves the plot along. the dog is still cute, though, and young kids may enjoy it.

jane russell was an underrated comedienne and singer (see son of paleface and gentlemen prefer blondes), but you'd never guess it from her display here. a real stinker, produced by howard hughes in his all-too-successful effort to kill off rko radio pictures.the movie kills its first opportunity to show off sexy jane when it places her in a bubble bath and then has her chastely singing "i'll be switched (if i ain't gettin' hitched)"--and it's all downhill from there. in her autobiography, russell apologized for the movie's number "lookin' for trouble" because it was supposedly so risque--nowadays you could show it on the disney channel. (by the way, said autobiography has a jaw-dropping photo of russell in a bikini, far sexier than anything

i'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is. bottom line: it was horribly acted, had enormous plot holes and went absolutely nowhere. the only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie: "a married man with a struggling business has a fling with his secretary." huh?? wrong movie apparently, although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true.--shelly

"tart" is a pathetic attempt at film making which wanders around and among a bunch of manhattan teens exploring all the usual teen preppie stuff...sex, drugs, and classical music almost completely without story, focus, or purpose. griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while swain dutifully works her way through another in her long list of dog flicks. nothing in this films works and wayne should consider getting a real job. not recommended for anyone. pu! ugh! (d)

why do people make bad movies? didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? there is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that i found this "movie" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and poorly acted. i admire them for the try, but the "actors" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. this movie deserves zero stars. but i did not have that option, so it gets a 1.

it was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. it was a poor man's (not to mention high school) "less than zero". i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. so many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. the voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst. i'm sure there are plenty of others to watch. don't waste your time on this.

spoilers!i gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that i will never forget.....by the way, my husband rented this surprising non-blow 'em up almost chick looking flick...but i guessed why when i saw the cover....girls in school uniforms....duh....lol....ah well, men if ya can't beat 'em join 'em.....;-)bijou philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen...too cute......not only gets into bestiality (her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character)..that would be the first worthwhile scene..then she enters a restroom in a lovely gown & goes into a stall....after a bit she gets up, goes out to the party she & the pathetically sad 'cat' character are at,& hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party...the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says, "oh my god it's poo."i love bijou phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices, this would definitely be one of them....and um, i would rent it for the poo scene if i were you.....i am not a big poo jokes fan, but it definitely puts the 'party people' in their place (they didn't look like they were having a good time anyway.....lol)...you will never forget these two scenes...hmm, but is that what we want in our databanks?....maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all....loldominique swain is kind of squirrelly & sad in her confusing nonsensical role in 'tart'. i don't know, i can't decide if i like her because she is so into indie films?? indie films are awesome & all but couldn't she pick a few good ones? i am going to check out a few more of her movies and reserve judgment.... but this one was, (pardon the reference to beasts) a dog.....

for the first time in reviewing films, i found myself immediately uninterested in this story. i don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. within the first thirty minutes, i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. i felt as if i had seen this structure before, and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. after thinking that it may just be my mood, i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. i just didn't care. that is not a good sign. the characters were bland. when i say bland, i literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate. the story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism. now, i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective. the casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. you knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces. these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by wayne.what immediately pulled me away from this story? it was mainly the characters. i have seen most of brad renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself. director larry clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character. within the first twenty minutes of renfro's screen time i was bored. i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. it was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive. he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite. without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown. renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film. while i am on the subject  nobody showcased the best of their abilities. what is going on with dominique swain, outside of lolita, i don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as cat storm doesn't help. bijou phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost. rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act. melanie griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in. maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.my biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film. nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together. there were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed. the robberies, the teenage "angst and woe", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random kids in the hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together. with this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape. family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers. wayne did not complete the task at hand.while i hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film i am left with little choice. with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any "good" behind tart. this was a film i had heard nothing about, and after viewing it i can see why. all wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film tart. it is hard for me to say this, but wayne ruined this film. while i don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as wayne took the helm. while most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in tart you can credit nothing. from the opening sequence until the end, i felt like i was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal. no consistency, no strength.overall, this film is a waste of your time. if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film. while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an etch-a-sketch. it was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up. wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life. avoid at all costs! grade: * out of *****

having just finished reading the book "one of a kind" a week ago, i was thinking "this would make a great movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players". i was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night. i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film. i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation. what a major letdown!all of the intriguing things about stu ungar were skimmed over quickly, and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody. ungar may have been a burnt-out jerk, but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively. that is what made him so fascinating. why not focus on that?and talk about watering down the real truth. this guy was excessive about absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep-deprivation. he gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn, he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens, his body was perpetually emaciated, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards. now that's a story!too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his ties with "vincent" and his daughter were hardly touched on) and hardly anything about his drugs use (which was exorbitant), his insane gambling and his incredible card-playing abilities.probably too late now, but i hope someone remakes this film properly. i had no problem with imperioli. he is excellent. the script just left him with nothing interesting to say.

wow, i just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and i'm not talking about the premature death of the great stu ungar. this film i'm sorry to say was terrible. absolutely terrible. a true tragedy in filmaking history. well maybe i'm being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar then don't even consider coming near this one. and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were trivialised and made out to be great novelty scenes. i watched it because of stu ungar but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but unpleasantly painful

well, the movie was no terrible, but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger. this movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born. i suggest reading the book "one of a kind" the real unger story. they left out huge parts of his life. they also at times did not understand the real caractor that he was. the actual facts of his life were at times out of order. and in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have. so please don't watch the movie; read the book. by the way i'm not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100% to the real story, but they did not even come close!!!

an insult to both poker and cinema, this movie manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant, and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore. still a fun film to make jokes about, from the lame gangster movie clichés of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. hilariously, stu ungar wins all three of his world series titles without playing a single hand on screen. his infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. his coke habit? 1 scene. his incredible memory? 0 scenes. they couldn't even get any real poker players. what did they cover? a lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs. oh, and a montage of stu waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense. why do i care so much about this little sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker craze? because i think there's still a great film to be made about stu ungar waiting for someone willing to do it right.

for the most part, "michael" is a disaster  ten minutes of charm and ninety's worth of missteps.travolta and macdowell do their best, frequently rising above nora ephron's numbingly banal script. but the film moves like a snail. and even within its fantasy context, the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis. (reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime  an apparent angel living on earth  out of their sight?) someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro ephron that william hurt, brilliant in so many other films, is no tom hanks. the movie's "climax" redefines the word contrived. ephron may be shooting for heaven here, but unfortunately "michael" is a long, long ride through cinema heck.

my website (theflickguy.org) lists "michael" as one of the worst films of the modern era. the following is an excerpt: "everyone slums some time in their lives, this was travolta's turn. i still don't know what the point of this terrible film was. nora efron has proved to be a competent writer and director, so what the hell happened here? the archangel michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a ham-fisted, chain-smoking sugar addicted fornicating slob whose biggest contribution to humanity (after sending lucifer to hell) was that he invented "standing in line". yes, how funny and charming. i don't find this offensive, i find it stupid. in its defense, i can say that the ending was ever bit unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attempt at story telling."

this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth, although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie.if i took this movie to heart, as someone who knows and believes the bible, i would have canned it pretty quick, but i don't think the general atmosphere was either mean-spirited or blasphemous. it was just ludicrous or just plain stupid.i mean, john travolta as a grubby angel? smoking? scratching his groin? quoting the beatles? a "warring angel" who knows nothing about heaven? an angel who flirts with all the women? yes, it's all absurd and certainly biblically- incorrect. i could tolerate all that but i don't know how many people, whatever beliefs they hold, who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it. it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and andie macdowell. some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it's insulting to any discriminating viewer.this is another nora ephron-directed film. man, i can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed. at least she's consistent.

this movie makes you wish imdb would let you vote a zero. one of the two movies i've ever walked out of. it's very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors. well...armageddon almost takes it, but not quite.

do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made? stop wondering. i'm telling you, michael is it!it is not "heartwarming," "entertaining," or "travolta at his best." it just sucks. if i had kids, i would let them watch deep throat before michael!a sold-out john travolta, a washed-up and balding william hurt, and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film.but wait...you'll get to hear andie mcdowell sing! yeah. hollywood really s**t all over us with this one!

i wanted to like this movie, but there is very little to like about it. it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa (northwest iowa, i guess), reminiscent of norman lear's cold turkey, which was one of the best movies ever made, according to people on imdb. so far, so good. and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy milbank's motel on earth? well, give it a chance, it's supposed to be a comedy. okay, so far, so good. but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do, and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had. the other characters in the movie don't have much appeal, either. michael brings a dog back to life, and we're supposed to be in awe of that. the people make up corny country songs. in the end, stapleton dances with travolta. big deal. if she was smart, she wouldn't even be in this movie. when it was over, i thought, "gee, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, corny, sacrilegious movie!" it's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else.

czech movie goers may have enjoyed and rated this film highly because it was czech, but i found it to be trite, tedious, moronic, boring, and insipid. again, i suspect "ramping" in order to increase sales of this dog of a film. amazon describes this film as being about a couple of fellows that refuse to grow up, but i will go one further--i think it is about two fellows that have entered a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone. i have been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film, and i would believe it. when he saw his performance he probably realized what a gosh awful job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which i am sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in "autumn spring." don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. it's nothing but a dog in a manger.

i happened upon a rare copy of this early almodovar film with high expectations - almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, i enjoyed his 1988 film "women on the verge of a nervous breakdown", and i had read one or two very positive reviews of the film. well, i must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film. i just found it incoherent, tasteless, and boring. yes, there are plenty of innuendos, people in drag, and crude sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 (which was almost certainly almodovar's intention), but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years, leaving a limp storyline. beyond that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - i just didn't find this film funny. i suppose it is possible there is a very select audience for a film like this, but i'm just not part of that audience, and not sure that i want to be.

i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it. even about three-quarters of the way through, i still thought it was jumbled and a bit incoherent, but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion. and then the bottom fell out. not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone, but the conclusion flips everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its headfor no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world, yeah i'm cool, and i know it. i love a good twist, i love a good ah-ha moment, but only when it is relevant to the story at hand. the complete misguidance on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale, timelines didn't need to be parallel and they didn't need to be separated by a week. all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director gavin hood and screenwriter kelley sane, which may be a good thing, because looking back, it wasn't really as solid a movie as i initially was going to blindly give it credit for.it is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the film-going public's consciousness, but it needed a story that delved deeper into the connotations and politics involved, rather than gloss over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husband's disappearance and the angst-filled rebellion of a daughter against her "interrogator" father. i understand that the bottom-line film attendee needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i don't fault it for going that route. my only qualm is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should be getting. instead we are shown numerous plot lines, all confusingly brought to the forefront before being sent back into the nether regions of our consciousness, never to be returned to. so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for, the wife? the interrogator? the cia agent? the victim? the senator? the middle eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend? at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would, which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid out.everything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion. this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so innocuous that you can't believe how huge the waves it spread were. the old butterfly wings flapping quote is in full effect, because one boy's mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many. whether by death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or career suicide; no one really escapes unscathed. however, at the end of the day, only the story about the man who has been excised to egypt for torture is really interesting. we are led to believe he is unequivocally innocent from the start, yet he is waterboarded, electrocuted, etc. in order to extract any information he might have. when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled, (whether true or not), and an observer without the guts to partake or stop it, the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end. the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entirety.i don't want to belittle people like reese witherspoon, (the victim's wife), or her senate employed ex, played by peter sarsgaard, because they actual do a good job with what they are given. even meryl streep, her kooky accent, and alan arkin don't detract too much. however, it is the trio of jake gyllenhaal's cia agent, yigal naor's interrogator, and omar metwally's victim that truly shine. naor is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worry-filled as a father attempting to locate his daughter. this man is brutal, but he is because that is what his occupation calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers. metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him. whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone, we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out. as for gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success, he finds a part that suits him. the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind, causing both ambivalence and a need to intervene. the two feelings wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish demeanor suit that battle perfectly.it is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main focal point, despite being the namesake of the film. with all the clutter around the edges, we as an audience get bounced around too much, lulled into a sense of time and sequence, and then slapped in the face as it all unravels in more of a laugh on us then a, "bet you didn't see that coming." i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie. had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more, but as is, one can still take some positives from the severely flawed whole.

the movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition, torture and the politics of the war on terror. others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie. my review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point.several questions are raised by this movie. first of all, was the protagonist guilty or not? there is no satisfying explanation for why the nsa decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place. is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the nsa thinks is a terrorist? if there is, the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me. it is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step.if the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? perhaps, we was well-trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty. however, there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either.the various other loose ends out there are: 1. so, a rogue cia agent has him released and flown back home. what prevents the nsa from picking him up again? a little publicity in the washington post? please give me a break here... if a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what does corinne whitman have to fear? 2. if the nsa has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom, why couldn't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed? 3. the plot is even more stupid anyways. any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not on one that can be traced back to him and his house.the whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers' heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. but when you think about it with any more depth, there is nothing of substance in this movie, only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what, that is it?!!!" at the end of the movie.

there are many so-called anti-war/anti-govt. policy films around now which start off as a mea culpa and end with 'our poor boys are getting hell out there so let the world sympathise with them, it's not their fault' - kind of stuff. i was half afraid that this would be another in that style even if it treated another subject/aspect of the same subject. i nearly didn't go and see it; for that matter, i almost did not write this review. what did we get here? an egyptian gets taken off to a secret off-shore torture centre, on u.s. orders, but it is another egyptian who has to do the torturing, not an american: 'see, we americans have clean hands,' and the egyptians are a bad lot anyway so let them harm their own. oh, and the goody had to be an american with a conscience: indeed many americans have them, but here the concept was misplaced. yes, we all know it is called extraordinary rendition and it began in clinton's time and it is now used for reasons well beyond control. otherwise it was very hackneyed and nervous about really condemning the u.s. for being party to torture; as if the makers were afraid to go the whole way for fear of being slanged as unpatriotic or whatever (take a look at the message board! anyone apologising gets a faceful of heavy verbal artillery). torture is a terrible thing, whether one is guilty or not; in the 18th century, frederickii, king of prussia, abolished it for convicted murderers - though i must say, a life sentence for a child molester is far less than what i want to see. all right, what about torture? this film did not really bring out its horror and hopelessness enough. when you are under torture,(now come the capitals for emphasis, i am not shouting) you will say anything, even if it is not true, even if you have not done the thing you are accused of, in the vain hope that if you say amen to whatever they are peddling, it will stop. it does not, but you never learn and you keep on saying that you did whatever it is they say you did, tho' you did'nt. another thing the film did not bring out enough was that torture is exceedingly, indescribably humiliating, and that feeling stays with you your whole life. it somehow changes people inside. how do i know all that? don't ask.re-edit: two things: the arabic that was used in the film was not the egyptian dialect. it's sort of worse than setting a film in new zealand with locals as the characters and everyone has american accents. also, the dreadful little preacher who was inciting his ignorant audience to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion, which should have been brought out. nor was it anywhere explained that any nincompoop can become a mullah/imam; he doesn't need any special qualifications, and that is a hiatus which needs to be put right: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and tne u.s.a.'s great ally, saudi arabia, finances so many of them. many thanks for this space.

i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television... and sorely disappointed at the end result.the only "amazing" thing was the wall crawling (despite the visibility of the cable). i didn't think nick hammond was peter parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. you could tell they were two different actors.granted, i can also spot in the modern spider-man movies when i am looking at tobey macguire and when i am looking at cgi. but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi. still, the 70's version could have been better despite lack of special fx.the webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them. and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in. hello? he's the web slinger people.sorry... didn't mean to get so worked up, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.

spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre: in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character, had complex moral issue, round characters and also highlighted social and political issues. in other words: spiderman was the comic book's coming of age. this tv series lacks all of those components. it's just a straightforward good buy / bad guy tv series suffering from obvious budgetary rerstraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. spiderman nylon webbing is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek. nicholas hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time. i think he was well into his thirties wheras spider,man was really teenager at the time. for some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing.

opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by theodor sparkuhl, and a good (not great) performance by jannings as henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera-work. henny porten chews the scenery as anne.it's all very beautiful; but it's all surface and no depth. the melodramatic tale of a woman wronged made it a hit in america where the expressionistic "the cabinet of dr. caligari" flopped in the same year (1920), proving that what is popular is not what endures. lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies, not sterile spectacles like this.

if you're a kid liking fairy tale "real life" adventures, see it. if you're a youth liking kids movies, why not see it? :) if you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids, you're way better of opting for the squirrel!the start of this film was a bit funny, and set some good premises for the happenings to take place. but after the kind of funny introduction of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story turned out kinda dull. when more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a dented lp or those commercials you really hate. and the culmination of the plot... *oh sigh*... poor, poor, poor!

i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change... i don't know...maybe it's because i'm not swedish...or french(the cannes commenter)...or any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth... born and raised in ny. lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century. and now holland. i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast... but this, in a word, isn't funny. see? now that's funny...that you're thinking that i made a mistake. i said, 'in a word' but then said, 'isn't funny'... nope. no mistake. if this is your type of humor, i'd say you haven't really had much of a life... consider your appreciation of this film a symptom... and please don't ever write another review...i have a tendency to believe them when they're unanimous. even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine...i figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredom...the anticipation of laughter that never materializes... i did smile once or twice, though... when i started the movie...and when i stopped it. that should be 10 lines.

my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it. if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie. i've watched many movies with my 4 year old and i can take almost anything. barney is refreshing after a shot of quigley. the plot, dialog, cinematography, & acting were one step above (or equal to) a cheap porn film. i feel cheated out of $3.69 that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life i will never get back. i will say my 4 year old liked it, luckily it was a rental we had to return right away.i just hope that the younger actor's careers are not ruined from being in this movie.

if you ever plan on renting (hopefully not buying) this movie, think again. it was as if gary busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die. i only wonder if busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because i just don't see the guy that acted so much better with keanu reeves in point break play in this disaster. it was a feel-good movie, but there are thousands of other feel-good movies that make you laugh without wanting you to get your money back.the only reason i would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see gary busey jump up and down like a monkey. if you want a good funny movie, pass up quigley and go rent spongebob or something.

while the dog was cute, the film was not. it wasn't the premise, or the theme that was a problem. the premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both. the theme is a worthy one. helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune.sadly, the adorable dog, the unique premise, and the theme were undercut by poor acting, stilted dialogue, and amateurish filming.even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through. how many times can that dog run up and down the same hallway? i can't spoil it for you, as i never saw the end. it just was not worth watching all the way to the end.

i registered at imdb solely for the purpose of warning others about this movie. hwo does anyone ever get funding for projects like this? that's the mystery. farewell to harry might be the worst movie ever, except that i tried to erase the others that rival this blathering idiocy. bad plot, not-credible logic runs throughout. i can't spoil this movie for you by revealing anything that would make your experience less enjoyable. there is nothing enjoyable about this movie. i have the cd and will send it to you for free, it is that bad. first come, only served. if i know you, this offer is void, because i wouldn't inflict this movie on anyone, not on purpose. you have been warned.

i'm sorry, but this movie is just way to shallow for me. in it, perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend keitel trying to make it as an actress. first of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? even after sitting through this, i still don't know. oh yeah, perez also inspires delorenzo to follow her like a lovesick puppy. there's no reason behind the love, it just kind of happens. there are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heartstrings, but it rarely works. the only character you really do feel anything for or with is keitel's character, and that's only because he does such a good job with it. any other actor and the character would have been just like the others.the script is basically an uninspired rehashing about how hard it is to make it as an actor/actress. it's been done and said before, the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp. the ending is...well, i don't want to spoil it. let's just say it feels unsatisfying. i'd be more upset if the story was any good to begin with. the directing is average with nothing truly wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch either. to reiterate the acting, the only one that does anything worth watching is keitel. though i could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear.oh yeah, eddie bunker shows up. as random as that mention is, that's how random it is in the film. and tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds.

the digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences lack suspense. this was essentially made for tv and it shows. david suchet looks bored and nigel planer looks down right embarrassed! and as for robert carlyle's dick van dyke london accent, no comment! if you want to pass away an hour or two when you've nothing on then it will do. if your going to buy the dvd wait a few weeks and pick it up in the bargain bin at asda, cos thats where its heading! if the budget was bigger and richard doyle's book followed more closely, then it could have been something special, but as it stands its a bit poor. watch the trailer instead! or read the book and see what could have been.

this movie follows in the tracks of the riddle for an all star british cast in a downright awful movie! poor cgi effects, poor editing, poor direction, a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin.nigel planer should've donned his neil wig once more & gone out with a laugh at least!it was like a particularly long & drawn out episode of "torchwood" but without the camp fake canadian doctor fella...it had the same overly dramatic music though, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to drum up some tension.oh the humanity!

well as the headline suggests this is not the particularly good movie i was hoping it would be. i thought it would be great with mr fully monty man himself but tragically not. from the beginning i literally lost interest immediately when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out there is random water coming from under the door, then bam a full on flood through the route of the house its hard to believe they didn't notice the rising water level outside or at least heard it. sorry for this to sound like a rant but it really grinds my gears and has affected me. most acting was poor and the story tried to copy nearly every cliché to each disaster movie ever but just failed in that sense. cgi was poor i could do a better job using ms paint, directing poor too, and at the end i didn't care about 1 character at all!!! don't waste your time people no wonder it was released straight to dvd. well thanks for reading xxx

i usually like these dumb/no brain activity movies, but this was just too stupid. there were way too many clichés and the plot didn't really make much sense. there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt. we didn't even get too see if the big master plan worked. we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther, the professor (that died because of stupidity (see below)).one scene annoyed me particularly. why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam? and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen, why didn't he bring two or three of them? then he would have survived that was bloody stupid. the movie is pretty full of such stupid things. i can not recommend it at all.

i don't normally write reviews, but for this film i had to. i'm shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste... the script was appalling... the editing awful... and the plot very thin. you spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what on earth they are doing. the latter half of the movie slows down slightly, but has no depth or feeling. the only saving grace is the nice, but still limited cgi, and the location being london. i gave 3 stars for that, and the fact the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they were given. if you fancy losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment, by all means, this is the movie for you. but i would recommend doing something else with your time instead, like watching the real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp

miscast, badly directed and atrociously written, this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or are suffering from insomnia, but only just. robert carlyle fully realises his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity with only one expression to his repertoire (that of a chronically constipated football hooligan nursing a crippling inferiority complex), which he manages at times to alter slightly by flaring his nostrils and baring a row of skewed yellow teeth (this to indicate anger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.) in his role as "the best marine engineer in the uk" and son of a university professor he is about as convincing as my neighbour's cat. tom courtenay, equally miscast, slurring and mistiming every line, appears permanently soused to the eyeballs, and would seem no more able to tell a flood from a puddle of his own urine if he were standing in it. all in all, another silly attempt on the part of the british to imitate hollywood pulp at its most rubbishy. the dialogue is a series of badly-delivered clichés; the action is disjointed; the plot is pointless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even make it into the basic two-dimensional sphere of their american counterparts.

i really do not joke when i can honestly submit that this film is not suitable for sunday night viewing on itv4.the underground scenes are just awful when london is supposedly under 30ft of water, robert carlyles character is drab. the police commissioners outfit reminds me of something kate moss threw up and nigel planer looks very very old, in fact, i am worried that he may have had suffered a stroke whilst filming.the father of robert carlyle who was 'right all along' has obviously been necking too many ketamin and whilst he has a major part in this awkward journey, he deserved to be killed off way way before he was caught pretending to be kate winslett (titanic) whilst dangling over the thames barrier.i'm sorry film lovers but avoid at all costs.

topical? certainly. entertainment? probably - but only on removal of any shred of the viewer's common sense. reality? only in so much that it was made on this planet.how thousands of people were supposed to have died as a result of a 5-metre wall of water in a city liberally littered with buildings in excess of 25 metres high is quite beyond me. carlyle's line to the effect of "how could anyone survive that?" when the shot shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable. further, if someone commits themselves to an area (under water) where one cylinder of air is not enough (i.e. they are going to die), why not use the simple expedient of taking more than one cylinder? clearly, the writer thinks that people in stressful situations cannot count beyond one (one cylinder, one floor).rather than watching this tripe, you would be more informed and entertained by throwing the dvd away and reading the pricing information on the cellophane outer wrapper.pitiful, truly pitiful, and a terrible waste of the on-screen talent.as for the sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be effected by the expendable men: yet more pc 'tosh'. small wonder that first blood, delta force, navy seals and other such movies of little or no merit will always have a following while this blatantly politically-motivated bilge is peddled.

this awful effort just goes to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects, but also let them devise the plot and write the script. someone somewhere has obviously come up with a new bit of software that asks a few questions then churns out four hours of loosely connected clichés, lousy dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you end up wishing had all drowned in the first five minutes.tom courtney took the prize for worst performance. saying that he was wooden would be an insult to trees. it's hard to fault robert carlyle in almost anything he does, but the odds were stacked against even him in this one, especially since he was for some unaccountable reason required to adopt a gor' blimey london accent.a complete washout.

'flood' is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script. the basic premise is fine: what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the thames flood barriers and engulf london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time? it's basically the new york segment of 'the day after tomorrow', but that shouldn't make it any less of a film. however, the script just isn't there. it's merely functional, flat, and lacking in depth. great british talents like robert carlysle and david suchet to name but two do their level best with what they've got, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something out of an old marvel comic. and it'd be frankly easier to turn back the tide. not that every actor gets let off the hook - tom courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film, but then he wasn't given much of a challenge.i applaud any opportunity to see some non-hollywood disaster flicks for a change, and i don't expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra- realistic graphics. however there's no excuse for shonky writing - especially from a country that has produced some of the best science- fiction ever made on next to no budget at all. this is the kind of half- hearted b-grade fluff the sci-fi channel produces, and that's hardly a target to aim for. if like me you are such a fan of disaster films you're still tempted, do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends. better still; don't bother.

you would have thought, given how much this overblown pile of rubbish must have cost, that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter. instead, they seemed to have opted for a bog standard hollywood 'paint by numbers' disaster movie plot and dialog. the only cliché they seem to have missed was the cute kid. but every other one is there. there's the sullen hero, flung together by fate with both his ex wife and estranged father. there's the doting dad and the rebellious teenager.there's the 'professor that everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he wasn't'(played appallingly by the normally excellent tom courtney seemingly in the grip of some powerful drugs), plus the comic duo wandering about in the deserted underground railway.i sat down to watch this full of anticipation. the cast is, as noted, amazing. yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be. stuff this useless should come with a warning. something along the lines of;'this film may have been made in britain but was aimed at the american market. it therefore contains tired clichés, stock characters, stilted dialogue and a plot so lame brained and simplistic that even george w bush could understand it.'avoid.

the production values for this film make it fall short of hollywood blockbuster status, and the script makes it fall short of cult status. what is left is a tired formulaic attempt at the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the ebb tide.a decent cast, are either miss cast, or cannot be bothered.the beautiful joanne whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of police commissioner nash who wears the most irritating matching waist clincher above her skirt.jessalyn gilseg plays the heavyweight part of director of the thames barrier with all the conviction of a fairground candy floss. her canadian nationality and accent were presumably drafted in to appeal to a transatlantic audience. it, and she, fails.her initial appearance in a tight fitting pink jogging suit as she arrives at work is risible.the part of the "siren old git who was right" is played by tom courtenay as though he is acting in his sleep, and the various plot twists that are designed to energise his son, played by robert carlyle, struggle to get any response from him.nigel planer looks determined to commit ritual hari kari for his failings as met office director, or for his acting, or both, and only david suchet emerges with some credit for his role as deputy pm.there was enough in the story, and the cast and the effects to have produced a decent effort. alas that did not happen.

on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good - it isn't.the cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing. the real disaster in this film is not the flood, but the script. it attempts to include every cliché in the book, all done incredibly poorly. the ending is very abrupt, but this is a blessing in disguise. congragulations if you make it that far.all three main male actors (carlyle, courtney and suchet) would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers. i hope they got paid a lot of cash, because none of their reputations come out in tact.the special effects are quite good, but the same thing was done to much better effect in the day after tomorrow.in short, a pointless exercise. don't waste your time.

this is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen. one has to take anything by truffaut seriously; it's not just some b-movie cranked out by hacks.evidently truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. among other things, how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie/marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's. the cliché ending (which i won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.

i'm bout it(1997)developed & published by no limit films>>pros: absolutely none>>cons: i don't even know where to begin!plot summary: master p plays a drug dealer that looks, talks, and acts more like a live-action cartoon character. that's all the plot i got out of this movie.review: i remember back when i was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called master p. this movie is so bad, it's not even funny. all the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is only audible when music plays, and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel. luckily, i didn't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates.my rating:1 out of 10my verdict: avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease.

where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit? this movie is about a young psychological profiling fbi woman, or something, that for some reason goes to work for the lapd for a wee while. there are some recognisable faces, like the "i love you, man" bloke from wayne's world, playing a cop (nice beard-age too!) and two guys who always seem to play cops playing..... you guessed it, cops. one of them was one of the cops in gross point blank following john cusack about the place, and the other is the fbi guy with specs in final destination, who is also in the fugitive as another cop. i know the fbi, us marshalls, cia, etc aren't cops, but they're all the same. they enforce the law to a certain degree, that makes them cops in my book. feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want, they're still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down. any, i digress. the woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that hasn't been looked at for yonks. she saw the dead body as a kid, so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it! i also like how the person profiling other people's psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child. surely that's the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head?! she starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open, even though he appears to be the same age as the woman, so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote a few school reports on it, and she decided he'd be the best person to ask about it.we then see that as well as reopening homicide cases from 25 years earlier, she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke sprints through a busy street wearing a balaclava. way to blend, moron! anyway, she and the cops she's with eating ice creams in the park give chase after him, and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it, the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river. this, if you haven't already guessed, is the best bit of the movie. i'm not sadistic, and don't have a hatred for babies or anything, but the scene just looks so stupid i promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie. it gets better when the cop from final destination & the fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend "it's a baby!" how did he not know that before he jumped in, is beyond me.anyway, she chases after the thief but loses him. later on she remembers that a random dog didn't bark at the thief, so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog. the dog had no markings or anything on it, so how she knew where to find the dog, and thus find the thief is another question i won't go into. it was shortly after this that i stopped watching. the story was moving really slowly, and after i had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit, i had kind of lost interest and missed what was being said.saying that, i'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty, and she was spending a lot of time with him, and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy. plus, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so i'm sure it was him.so all in all, a pants film, but worth watching just for that one glorious scene.

first of all, season 1 is intolerably bad. the prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two dimensional they're nearly transparent, and the direction is terrible. it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play, characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines, passing off as random prison talk. soon the show gets better, but not by much. the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair-bound augustus hill, who is played impressively by harold perrineau. the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues, most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's taking place in the show.unfortunately, the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes. consider the whole situation, first of all. prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk, doing drugs, and they not only have cd players (cds?? they might as well pass out steak knives), but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners. christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. guards that don't do much. near the end of season two, an older prisoner's grandson is diagnosed with leukemia, and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of $20 and $50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish. these have to be the richest prisoners in the world. every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring, loving guys except kenny wangler, an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing. even adibisi wanted to be nice. but that's okay, because there is no order or sense in the show, so even this is not much of a distraction.later, shockingly, there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an "i love cops" t- shirt. in prison!! can you imagine?? i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school, and in the picture, one of my friends was holding an "i love cops" bumper sticker, and one of "the woods" (guys who have been in prison for years and years) saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds. my cousin got lucky. kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks. one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class. you may lose track of who is in charge, the prisoners or the guards. more than one investigator, for example, goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade. personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators. let's see, what else? shillinger's son od's in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs. he just...got them, i guess. and make sure to pay attention, otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums. i didn't know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options. how about this, when robson asks about dr. faraj's schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given, faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot. do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners? after poet and o'reilly make the announcement to the entire prison, robson asks to see dr. faraj, and is escorted to his office, brought in without knocking, and the guard promptly leaves without a word. they might as well give him a gun.i shouldn't go on about stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, i can't stop it. who thought of the chinese refugees who can't speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they're needed? who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? who though of robson's gum transplant? what's the deal with busmalis and agamemnon? agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson. macbeth, because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end, as it were. but what are the worst ideas? things that go nowhere, which are constant. an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb. he threatens to blow up the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a dud, and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated. nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again. it's like it never happened. in one episode, prisoners are given dogs to train. what the hell?? if that wasn't bad enough, during one training session, a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise. no one seems to mind.i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out, the culprits are pulled aside, they don't say anything, and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says, "i hope you don't think i'm gonna let this go!!" and then they walk away and let it go. the audience won't remember. maybe i'm spoiled by prison break, but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play. a short one. at least a low-budget movie. there is just not enough here to sustain a multi-season tv show. then again, i watched six seasons of it on dvd. sometimes i don't understand myself...

not for the first time, i'm out of kilter with the majority view. oz is a dreadful, pretentious, voyeuristic series. the makers have their cake and eat it. oz, em city, etc are used as ultra- crude signals that the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy. this allows viewers the feeblest of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beings.when you watch an episode, please remember that while the foul-mouthed, violent, absurdly convoluted, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes, several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water.oz is exploitative drama at its worst. it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful. it blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a mahler symphony.dialogue is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian. the liberties taken with realities are stupid. here's a nightclub owning dandy, arriving at oz in his foppish finery, complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye, brandishing a stash of drugs that nobody detected. here's a murderous wimp bleating about the heat death of the universe, begging to be killed, but of course being refused by the brute he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himself.the action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic, dim-witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown. don't worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will be along within a minute or two. finally, oz is obviously pretentious. you don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow. you can watch it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything with a huge wink (or same word but for a change of vowel) to the audience. yes, you can be a nasty-minded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the cleverness, post-modernistic, etc skills of the oz production team. they appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane.truly, a despicable series. and every hour it shows, rewarding its makers and actors, and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary, another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible, successful, widely-praised series.

because it came from hbo and based on the imdb rating, i watched the first season of this series, what a waste. the characters are occasionally interesting but mostly cartoon-like. the acting ranges from good to mediocre talent with a s t r o n g emphasis on the latter. not only prisoners, also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable, it's such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong testicular fortitude to keep watching. the violence, as with most of the developments in the story, is titillating and whatever morality is supposedly served up, it's of the lite variety. if your idea of excellent television includes the the writing, acting and overall production quality seen in the sopranos, deadwood or six feet under, avoid oz. if you want to see a disneyland for illiterate jerks, watch oz. stuff like this gives edgy a bad name.

when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one. now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ), my opinion remains the same. the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak.

people, please don't bother to watch this movie! this movie is bad! it's totally waste of time. i don't see any point here. it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again.

an updated version of a theme which has been done before. while that in and of itself is not bad, this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other "inherent and pure" evil ones do. predictable, ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark. not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending.

this is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. the result is like every single episode of "columbo" or "murder she wrote". the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock! this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. skip this one, you are not missing anything.

this adaption contains two parts: 1. the "now" time, when gulliver is at home in england and soon is put into a mental asylum by the evil dr. bates 2. the "described" time, in which gulliver describes his travels.the times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo, which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part, and followed the book as written. in the book, there is no dr. bates, no asylum, and mrs gulliver gets very little mention. the travels - in plural - are depicted as one in the movie. there are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there, look at them if you want that stuff. the "now" time part adds absolutely nothing to the story's value, is a complete invention by the movie adapters, and takes valuable time from the real story. all the time when this was going on i was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown.so much for the drawbacks. the parts which actually are part of the real story are well done, and the cgi is really well done for its time. many small (and a few medium-sized) parts of the real travels are simply cut out, but that does not make the story halt. this is afaik the only version which depicts all four travels, and for that the movie should get special mention. the two interspersed parts get approximately equal time. i rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. averaging out, i give it a 4/10. if only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99% on the actual travels, since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels. why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon swift's work, i do not know. my best guess is that cgi was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets, gci, etc. in order to keep total costs under some limit, while at the same time producing a mini-series which clocked in at some set number of minutes.

george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit-com man about the house . though i haven't seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish fourmile family , a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags .having seen this " big screen version of the show " i find myself asking what it's a big screen version of ? certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name . for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like: " did he give it to you " " no that's the first time a man has resisted my charms " " i meant the envelope " you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples ( who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com ) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films . in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it

g&m started a the odd couple downstairs in man about the house and went on to amusing the nation in their own sitcom.what was the typical small-scale personal charm of the couples chemistry on the small screen, g&m's transferral to the big screen was as appalling as genuis's morcombe and wise, and countless fine tv shows.unfunny. unsatisfying and featuring an ill yootha joyce who died before the film was released.

miles o'keefe stars as ator, a loin-clothed hero who resembles a chippendale's dancer. the conan-wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a cher wig, and protect the earth from the geometric nucleus, a sort of primitive atomic bomb. watch closely for visible sunglasses and tire-tracks. mystery science theater 3000 made fun of it under the title cave dwellers.

this movie has some of the worst production values and editing i've ever seen. there are several instances of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines, actors walking in front of actors who are talking, and one point where the film skips about seven frames. not to mention the heroine getting shot in the chest, yet she starts limping! oh, and what about the secret passageway that is well lit and right out in the open. awful.the plot is non-existant, something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and some kind of caveman war. ator pulls out a hang-glider at one point in the film's dumbest moment. the dialogue is stupid, containing such gems as "it is everything and nothing." and "i can feel it, here."the movie is a mess, a confusing, insipid mess. ator is a bland hero, the sword fights are absurd, and the plot plods along slowly. all in all, this is a movie to avoid.

cave dwellers, or the blade mater, or whatever it's called, is in one word: vile! i saw this on mst and i laughed not only at the great running commentary, but at the inept film making that was demonstrated. sunglasses, tire tracks and where did ator get a hang glider? then they lift a few shots from another movie, where eagles dare as tom servo points out. to show just how cheap this movie really is, watch the scene where ator and thong have to battle invisible swordsmen. or even better, look for the giant hose dressed up like a snake that ator must wrestle! and what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie?

after i saw this i concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward i found out that keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. however, a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts). one item that i believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene, in the movie, whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w/o anesthesia. though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! women understand this even better. i suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. in fact, a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste. though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really "excels" in that department. this could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of dylan thomas during wwii; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against dylan but really muddles this. instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of. in a way. perhaps. somehow. of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! a lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though i have stated that already i will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess.

this is one of the worst pieces of cinema i have seen in some time. this is also my first review so you can tell i must hate this film at lot.don't get me wrong, i like my serious films. i don't like hollywood too much, i tend to like french, italian, offbeat us or anything that tries to communicate something sensible.but this was awful. why? 1. the plot (such as it was) was entirely unbelievable, even though the director seems to be hinging everything on a feeling of realism.2. the main character has nothing to recommend him. does he smoke for coolness or to show us his angst? for goodness sake this guy is meant to be an ex-dodgy mafia lawyer. are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet? and he smokes...so he must have deep personal issues. pop psychology at it's best. in the final moments, i almost cheered as he gets buried in the cement. best place for him. and i thought that was about the only good scene. or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits.3. the entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl. she was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old, old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as demonstrated by smoking). happens all the time. in really bad films that is.4. the pace was so leaden. i like slow, i like careful. but this was just deathly.5-50 a bunch of other stuff that i really can't be bothered to write.awful.

i was so looking forward to seeing this film that i can't really understand how i got the impression i would enjoy it. i'm afraid it really is a yawn fest - every single patron in the cinema i attended yawned and fidgeted frequently during the whole film. this is a shame because it is a fantastic story - i'm inclined to think that it would make a better read. it is not helped by the principle character only showing his teeth once - and that was as a result of the camera angle. as the story unfolds it becomes easier to understand the main character's dilemmas. however, the suspense and drama that could have made this a really top rated film have been completely spoilt by the dull treatment. dull as a half-baked documentary!

very slow, dull, enigmatic film. maybe the kind of film jean-luc godard would have made had he been italian. certainly conveys how tedious, repetitious, joyless and empty a person's life can be, but i don't usually go to the cinema to find that out! the plot (such as it is) doesn't convince. why a gorgeous hotel receptionist (an exception to the dullness of the film) would be the slightest bit interested in a moody, chain-smoking, silent loner who speaks in 'deep' aphorisms baffles me. very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character. one feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to 'snap out of it!'. his brother is a much more human character. the ending is inconclusive and puzzling. everyone in the cinema (when i saw the film) went out muttering about how they nearly fell asleep. of course, it shouldn't have to be a hollywood bruce willis-style 'shhot-em-up' and 'crash-bang' fiesta, but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling. one of the best italian films ever?! pleease...an art-house, curiosity at best.

aimless teens on summer break in a small ohio town can't find any meaningful ways to fill their time. some consider driving to chicago; others are content to drink and bully their peers. in a random act of alcohol-fueled arrogance, the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book. the handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces. a night or two later, one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed. he turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peers."demon summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. the production values are low, but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious. little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed. the acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay. on the positive side, the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards. despite this, the gore is minimal. makeup effects aside, there is little going for this film, even for die-hard gore-hounds. not recommended.

an odd, willfully skewed biopic of dyan thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (sienna miller) and childhood love (keira knightley). matthew rhys plays thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and cillian murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet.the film never seems to decide on where it's going. there's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. miller is the choice of the two (i found knightley competent at best but then i have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent welsh accents. other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of william (murphy), arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10

this movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being "feel good" and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it. i can't imagine how the inner circle of norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star-packed premiere. its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the norwegian media scene is. had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves.the combination of literally amateur actors, home-made style visual effects, awkward dialogue, painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot, really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality. stay away.

this is one of the most awful movies i've ever seen, probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless blueberry. how can harald zwart even have put his name on this crap. i'm feeling every ounce of respect i had for him waning fast.so what is it about this film that makes it so poor? is it the story? yes. is it the actors? yes. it it the whole "look and feel" of the movie? yes.to start off with the story, my god!it's about as cliché-ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14-year old who is late writing his/her paper on "what i did this summer". the feel-good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the story.the actors are amateurs, i know, and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. but for this to work, the characters have to be charming and/or funny (preferably both), so that the viewers don't mind the cheeky acting, or perhaps it even adds to the characters. in this case, not even close baby! you start off disliking the characters mildly, and by the end of the film (i think it's about 90 minutes long, although it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys! it should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid hickeys. their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes, only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground. even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very, very embarrassing (i'd rather have my sister make a fool of herself on american idol).finally, why cram in a bunch of misplaced norwegian celebrities? they look even more out of place than the actors, if this is possible. these celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see-through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inception.i cannot even begin to stress how much i'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again...

i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as i expected - based on the other reviews that i have heard.other than 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original "emmanuelle" (1974), emmanuelle arsan, 2. the lead character being a sexually free spirit, and 3. being set in the exotic locale of asia, "laure" doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor.i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that i'm really not that interested in, i.e. the voyeuristic, open relationship between laure and nick, "i'm just happy with whatever brings her pleasure"...something along those lines. i cannot relate to this mentality and the film/characters don't really shed any light.the second half about finding the mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film. one that i didn't care for. by that time, i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest.maybe i just didn't get it.i'll leave it at that.

there were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. i never bought into that stuff. the "screwball comedies" were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the fred astaire films.here, barbara stanwyck plays a famous "country" magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years, and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). she even lies to a guy about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in classic films.she's a new york city woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track. i guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. please pass the barf bag.most of this film is not funny. stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. as for dennis morgan, well, pass the bag again.

oh god! it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. i would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote. why? i saw it in a theatre! see this film on dvd or on tv! the shooting is really really poor!!!!! it keeps shaking all the time, in a completely tasteless framing!its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema. you got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat! it's really a shame 'cos, the story is edited in a non-linear way which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. watch this at home!

elderbush gilch was a big disappointment for me. i'd heared how great it was, how important it was. it just didn't strike me. it had a dim-witted story line, plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are thurroughly offensive by today's standards. while most of d.w. griffith's films have depth and intelegence, this one feels more like a formula-baised programme picture.i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in pre-birth of a nation roles, plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good. acording to future griffith cameraman karl brown, audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end. i felt nothing. and beleave me, i lve watching griffith's early work at biograph. this film just isn't what it used to be.the best thing about this film it that, for all of it's flaws, it has many of griffith's touches to it. he handles his principal actors pretty well, plus the scene where the indians are encircling the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation, a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later.

why do i hate this? let me list the ways:i have nothing against mary pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid.there's a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it's considered funny---and it goes on for 15 minutes strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurtthe title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slursfor a "family" film the fights were way too violent (loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid seriously, 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off. the slurs, racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me. also there was no plot that i could see. the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era.just painful. avoid.

oddball black-comedy romance featuring a great cast and a less than stellar script. brenda blethyn ("lovely & amazing") is the title character 'betty', a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful, blonde secretary. guess who's playing this minor role, yup! naomi watts ("mulholland drive") must of sandwiched this project in before her superstar status was insured with the blockbuster thriller "the ring."on the male side of the cast list there's the woefully miscast alfred molina ("frida") an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for 'betty' which have lain dormant for decades. perhaps miramax is hoping molina's turn in the upcoming "spider-man 2" might generate some interest in this little trinket which belongs on the dvd rental shelf.but the award for wildest thankless performance goes to christopher walken ("catch me if you can") who goes completely over the top as 'modern' undertaker with his vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town. his character must have parachuted into the village because there's little reason for him to exist in this script.that said, if you'd like to see some top-notch actors engage in some low-brow humor then this one's for you, and if this isn't your cup-of-tea then try renting "harold and maude," the ultimate funeral movie that's still funny to this day.

russians never dropped children's toys filled with explosives over afghanistan, that never happened!!! who did invention of that?? hollywood portrays russian army as horrible, dreadful troops of evil! that is disgusting!! united states president jimmy carter had accepted the view that "soviet aggression" could not be viewed as an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to the persian gulf region. the uncertain scope of the final objective of moscow in its sudden southward plunge made the american stake in an independent pakistan all the more important. a great deal of damage was done to the civilian children population by land mines.

very curious that nichols and hanks would team up for this, obviously they believe it. strange because it should carry the title "charlie wilson's war the lie.how could the time frame leave out the real history that while ridding afganistan of the russians the cia was providing support for the taliban, and today's world of terrorism. in 1990, bin laden went home to saudi arabia as a hero of jihad, who along with his arab legion, "had brought down the mighty superpower" of the soviet union in afghanistan. to avoid any connection to osama bin laden is to say again, hollywood cares little for historical truth. charlie wilson, a patriot, hardly, more like a congressman gone amok.

this movie has the distinction of being the worst movie i have ever seen, and the only film i have ever given a 1 out of 10 on imdb as of yet. i was fooled into renting it because of the cool h.r. giger cover art on the box. this cover art is the only thing the least bit good about this steaming pile of...it was about frat boys fighting "freaks" in a strange but not the least bit interesting post apocalyptic world where the cities are in ruins/chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to haze other men into braindead frat organizations. the most uninspiring performances by boring characters, not so special effects, dreary, un-original scenery and just generally extremely poor quality in all production aspects make this lemon the all time loser on my list.final rating: 1/10 i wish i could give it a zero.noob aalox

coach preachy or straight sappy. it's bad writing combined w/even worse acting. you can choose to drink the gatorade of this after school special, but i didn't, not even on it's 20th toby robbins/islander philosophy, motivational moment. it's too much posturing to be entertaining and not substantive enough to be informative. i have respect for the coach and the program this movie is inspired by, but the move itself is awful. as someone who has played rugby for nearly 20 years in the states i had hoped for a better rugby movie (even one that has something loosely to do with rugby). and i can tell you that the haka performed by a bunch of haoles and islanders is not intimidating (much like when it's performed today by the all blacks, seriously boys, everyone has seen it,it's time to put it away). if you want real intimidation, line up across from a bunch of south africans (the real eye gouging convicts of rugby). this is a fake and badly done movie about being a genuine and good person.

this movie, like so many others (remember the titans, miracle), follows the basic sports-movie formula: there's a guy, he's a jerk. jerk does bad. jerk must play by someone else's rules. someone else's rules change jerk, jerk becomes good. insert tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). tragedy effects jerk, makes him totally change. jerk must now play championship game. lots of close-ups on the sweating players and the balls. jerk wins. quote from coach or news or something that explains title. credits. weren't you touched? these movies can now be used to sort out the morons of society. anyone who pays to see this in theatres must be slapped.

first off just let me say that i live in south africa where rugby is our biggest sport by far, and our national side, the springboks, have won the rugby world cup twice, so it's quite a big deal over here. i've played all my life and i'm shocked at the poor attention to detail in this movie! at first i thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of neal mcdonough, nick ferris, gary cole and sean astin for goodness sake, but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport. they basically mashed it together with your normal everyday american football movie.my first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values of rugby, but the discipline or should i say the total lack thereof during the games are contradictory to this. in the final it looks more like an nfl game with penning being tackled of the ball numerous times, in front of the referee...that would've immediately led to a couple of red cards, because foul play like that would never go unpunished in by a referee, of that i can assure you! you'd also not be able to find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over his team. any coach would take a dump on a players head if he intentionally stiff arms an opposing player or double teams him like they did in the final...red card and certain suspension, full stop.secondly, it's absurd that a coach would take a brand new player, who has played wing all of his life i gather, move him to hooker which is a highly specialized position and say that it's for the good of the team?! what?! hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to be able to scrum extremely well and preferably be able to throw the ball in at line-out time, which penning never does for some or other reason. by moving a wing to hooker without any extensive long term training it would firstly lead to your team's demise at scrum time & secondly the poor kid would probably break his neck! how is that good for the team i ask you? finally, the overall high emotional pitch of the movie is way too much, because even though rugby is a great sport, and it builds great friendships & team spirit, it rarely gets that out of hand & corny. i've seen true-life football drama's with less emotion than this movie & it turned out great, but in this one sean's (penning) acting skills is dragged way too far and the movie attempts too force an emotional response out of the audience, which ends up being boring and hard to watch at times.hollywood have made some great sports movies over the years, but next time they venture into a sport which has just recently picked up in the states, they should try and do their homework & maybe get some experts into the fray.do it right or don't do it at all!

this movie is horrendous. the acting is cheesy and laughable. if you know anything at all about rugby the match action is boring. in fact any episode of power rangers contains more realism than this movie. the 'action' consists of no more than one pass and a shot of guy landing over the try line or being tackled without the ball and hectic hand held shots of who knows what. it's impossible to tell. there is nothing of the excitement, skill and construction of try scoring that real rugby contains. as for the haka, this is a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, much like the white rasta character that should have been left out of the film. next time there's a rugby movie made we can only hope that people who know rugby make it.

ok from the point of view of an american, who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for them.first of all its got heart, good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy. however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport, it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseball/basketball stars. am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didn't even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie. in summing up to me this movie was terrible. if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google "all blacks" this is new zealand's national team and the ones who made the haka famous. believe me they will make the highlands boys look like school girls.

awful, awful, awful...i loved the original film. it was funny, charming, and had heart... this piece of junk has none of those things.reused jokes from the original film, stupid plots, bad animation, different voices (with the exception of kronk and yzma) that sound nothing like the ones in the original (especially pacha... *shudder*).the characters are off model, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around.and why is kuzco a jerk again? i thought he had reformed... but since when are these tv spin offs loyal to the original *rolls eyes*.i'm sorry, but there is nothing redeemable about this... at all.avoid at all costs.

it pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame, repetitive and lazy series. it is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a bad way. whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research, instead of filling it with one-liners and hollow new characters, and the classic jokes from the first movie over and over and over and over again. sure they get a little creative, but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist. pretty much like listening to creed, or nickleback. kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the bug, bucky appears in the background, kuzco flirts with malina, she disses him without sounding like a bitch, yzma disguises herself as "principal amzy" and she calls kronk, and he forgets that she is yzma. i admit, this show does have it's moments. another problem is the fact that yzma looks younger and pacha looks....weird. also, no one can replace david spade and john goodman! their the ones who made kuzco and pacha kuzco and pacha! sorry, but i give this show two thumbs down.

the most stupid of seagal's movies i've ever seen. the final scene is just crescendo of stupidity. my recommendation - if you really like steeve seagal's movies, never , never rent or buy this one - do not repeat my mistake and keep a good impression of him, which i've lost

wow, i haven't seen a movie this bad since "fire down below". wait, that's a seagal movie too. like "on deadly ground" and "fire down below", seagal centers the movie around his environmental awareness message and how the military, fbi, and cia are incompetent idiots. problem is that both reality and a sensible plot are secondary to whatever gobbleygook social commentary seagal is trying to get across.

in 1932, humphrey bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. and, because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a b-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations. after seeing it, i could see why it would still take bogart many more years and another film studio before he became a household name. while the film isn't terrible, it certainly isn't good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today.bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. however, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his dreams all seem to go on hold. as one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just don't mix.while bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the road to skankville--having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! bogey has no idea his sister isn't the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is....bogart's sister!!! all this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. however, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes i have watched in a very long time! by now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with bogey's sister (whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for bogart, she's about to fly away and kill herself. bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! this is so utterly silly and ridiculous, i found myself laughing out loud. up until then, i might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 (how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me).the bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. on top of that, it's all wrong for bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. manly and solid better suits the man--one of america's great actors but clearly out of his element here.by the way, those who love pre-code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic production code was adopted in 1934.

apart from some quite stunning scenery, this steven seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend any time watching it. for a seagal movie it has very little (almost no) action but he does put in some reasonable (for him) acting in contrived character development scenes. not recommended. to anyone.

steven seagal has made a really dull, bad and boring movie. steven seagal plays a doctor!!!!!!???! this movie has got a few action-scenes but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. a group of american nazis spread a lethal virus, which is able to wipe out the state of montana. wesley(seagal`s character)tries desperately to find a cure, and that is the story of the patriot. the patriot is an extremely boring film, because nothing happens. it is filled with boring dialogue, and illogical gaps between events, and stupid actors. steven seagal has totally scre#¤d up in this movie, and i would not recommend this guff to my worst enemy. 3/10

this film is without a doubt the worst action film i have ever seen. i am sorry, but it is just pathetic. in fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be a serious one) is when a chicken speeds across the road, on foot, at about 100 miles per hour. this pathetic editing mistake makes the film absolutely hilarious for approximately 2 seconds, then it is back to "non stop, on the edge of your seat, as you try to find a comfortable position to sleep in, action!"

since i am not a big steven seagal fan, i thought this was a pretty good movie. it is apparent that his fans are very displeased with this drama that lacks an over abundance of martial arts and brute force.gailard sartain plays a self claimed patriot leader of a militia in a standoff with the atf for weapons violations. he surrenders with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus. seagal is a former cia agent turned country doctor that pressures himself to find the antidote for the lethal bug that has incapacitated a small town. his grandpa's native american herbal remedy figures into the salvation.notable appearances by l.q. jones, camilla belle and silas weir mitchell. my personal favorite in this movie is whitney yellow robe. she is stunning and appears to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role.despite the far fetched ending, this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action.

seagal was way off the mark with this film. i'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this, instead it had injections and cheesy music. even if you're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead.

this is so embarrassing. it's a remake of the wedding singer, which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to disapprove of this film. it has the same plot, same jokes, same characters. jeez, people need to be more original.

as a kid, i never understood why anyone would watch this very crappy show. it was pretty stupid and i always wanted spridle and jim-jim to get in some sort of fatal accident (they were that annoying).now, almost 40 years later, i have a new attitude about the cartoon. while i still think it was complete crap, this is only in regard to the american version of the show. that's because i was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in japan. you see, the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes. that's bad enough, but what else they did is beyond belief--they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were nothing like the originals! for example, one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! as a result, i really don't know if the original show really was bad--it might have been brilliant. but who can tell considering all we have to watch is this americanized mess!?

this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least. you would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released, however retro puppet master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story, lack of any emmontional connection to any characters, and dragged out slowly scene to scene. no build up of strong plot, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie, if you can sit through the whole reel. i never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their "final chapter." i hardly suggest watching this flick, but if you must i wouldn't recommend making anyone else sit through it with you.

this film may have been the first puppet master but this sure bored me to death when i saw this stupid movie,i wanted a refund. this was a bad series to the puppet master and i'm sure that i am not the only one that thinks this was terrible. to some it was great but, to others it was a ticket to snores-ville and boy are they right. the puppets didn't even do anything nor did they kill people. it should't be seen by people so i'm warning you not to see it. you will be disappointed even to the fans who love puppet master, it was a waste of their time and it didn't make so much money.nobody even got kill but one or two,very pointless.1/10

this is officially the terrible, boring, corny, and ridiculous movie ever created. the movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends, and they land a 747. his dreams are very corny and make no sense at all, and is very poorly done. every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology, and might have been created by the kid that plays the "leading role" in the movie. if you watch this movie, it will definitely make you stupider. i advise you to never consider watching this movie, and if you do, good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off. my comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made. the person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that i dreadfully watched, and wish i never watched. peace.

oh, how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their goldenboy paul schrader (author of taxi driver) when this movie came out. i never saw the qualities they were detecting when i watched this movie back in the day, so i re-viewed it, to see if i got it wrong. mishima is extremely uninteresting. this is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture. the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. and the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.it must be a triumph when you learn you've landed philip glass; but then you have to get something out of him. glasses score offers not a whit of distinction from his other work, nor does it provide the film any perceptible value. in 2010 it should be clear to anyone that schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance (cat people, autofocus, light sleeper, patty hearst, american gigolo). he can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else. schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.

ocean's twelve: just plain stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two.an art robbery. 10 known actors, at least. a weak script and very slow developing idea. that's why i characterize a movie i only saw at least 20 minutes of it. don't get me wrong, you may like it. but i only like the ocean's films because of the heist theme. if ocean's 12 it's not about heist then what's the point to see it? glad soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. kudos for that.steven soderberg isn't really a good director. apart from his hit "sex lies and videotapes"... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. shame on him. but his fault only.

i enjoyed oceans 11, i thought it was quite enjoyable, helped by the performances and the direction. however, i was disappointed with this film. don't get me wrong, it is not a complete dud, thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt, catherine zeta-jones, george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh. however, the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist. second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. the camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. the screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. so much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 bethany cox

what can i say about ocean's twelve? who thought that it would ever come to this? a gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't retrace. i found myself amazed at how bad this really was. really! i have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable. i'm a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel. what was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back? the movie is just boring and so drag along that i can't ever sit through this. it really is bad. just stay as far, repeat, far away as possible from this movie. it's worthless.

i am a shakespeare lover since childhood. i am also a jew. merchant of venice is anti-semitic through and through no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to re-interpret it.in the play, shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness, no warmth, no love except for money and cruel revenge, whereas the christians are kind, moral people. his motives in the play revolve around money (he plots revenge from the start based on damage caused to his business as well as blind racial hate), not noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you to believe. and this characterization is given to him by shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. as final proof, the happy ending is where the jew loses his money and is forced to convert to christianity.i acknowledge this and move on. it is part of history and i enjoy shakepeare despite this fact. therefore i expect a movie based on this play to play it straight. i would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any whitewashing.but many of the the bard's artful subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie. for example, in the last scene where the men discover portia's undercover work as a man who also took away their rings, instead of the playful game of words and misunderstandings as the truth reveals itself, it becomes a mean-spirited game where two bitchy women play cruelly with their soon-to-be husbands.so instead, we are only left with lovely detailed sets, fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor casting, one intense courtroom scene, and a controversy.the truth is, i think it would be much easier to identify the anti-semitism in the story and move on if it were left as is. despite all the whitewashing the makers of this movie pulled out of their hats, there is plenty of hatred left, only now people can make excuses and pretend the portrayal of jews isn't so bad anymore.and finally, another problem is with most of the actors being miscast. pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the horribly fake accent. fiennes as bassanio is charmless and awkward with the language. irons is dependable as always but doesn't do much with his role. portia is somewhat ok but unlikeable, and covered in bad makeup, just like the movie.

i saw this film as a sneak preview before the venice opening at the telluride film festival. your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of shakespeare. on the plus side: pacino gives a very good performance indeed as shylock; lynn collins is a fine portia; and the film has a sumptuous look. the negatives are predictable. "the merchant of venice" is arguably the most difficult of all of shakespeare's plays to stage today, largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history. the romantic plot with bassanio and portia presents no problem. the character of shylock does, because we lack the original frame of reference of the elizabethan audience. shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations, and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the old law. when he says "hath not a jew eyes?" he is a character; when he proclaims "i will have my bond!" he is an abstraction. the long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut to ribbons) is the key to the play, in that it re-establishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil (the shylock of the trial scene) forces are ejected. it is possible to make psychological sense of the character of shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls around--the key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic.pacino's performance almost does it, but not quite. the film can't quite make up its mind--on the one hand, there is the right movement in the character of shylock, and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of jews being abused and venetian whores with rouged nipples (no doubt to show the decadence of antonio et al). shakespeare was not writing an ibsen-like social drama; he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love versus law at the center of the shylock plot.in this sense, the film is a travesty--radford's surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means. (taking the beginning of the final scene, cutting most of it, and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example.) there are some other significant difficulties. jeremy irons, a fine actor, plays antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives. joseph fiennes is pretty but shallow as bassanio. most of the actors, with the exceptions of collins, pacino, and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene, mumble their dialogue.final verdict? a pretty film with a few decent performances. it's not shakespeare, it's poor interpretation. not really worth your time or money--although lynn collins as portia almost redeems it.

watching this movie and then listening to the commentary, it's clear that michael radford doesn't understand this play. the first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenth-century venice. which sounds truly odd, yes, that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible. but anyone who's studied shakespeare knows that, while he set most of his plays in exotic locals, the culture and values are always contemporary england. this doesn't hurt the film, but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge.where radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious. he manages to suck every joke out of the script, leaving the whole production flat. every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters. even shylock's 'do we not bleed' speech is a mild, awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he's supposed to. the lovers are solemn and far too restrained (joseph fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper), gratiano (who has to promise to behave at one point) is more sober and collected than bassiano (who makes him promise to behave), jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with lorenzo pouting.in the commentary for the bland and watered-down court scene, the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at portia's 'a pound of flesh, no more, no less' sentence; ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter. 'the merchant of venice' is a comedy and radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative drama.the film has no intelligible focus, yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. the characters are forced into high drama veils, so they come out sounding like ibsen characters reading victorian poetry. and the comedic ending, where all of the good guys go to bed happy, is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like they're finding stiff- upper-lip peace with impending death, rather than reconciling with lovers. even lancelot and antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mourners.the film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don't understand the script. it is stern where it should hysterical. it is reserved where it should be passionate. it is michael radford where it should be william shakespeare.

this is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! the ever-wooden cynthia rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in los angeles. she and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting ring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. about a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. a lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (and counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the fbi? i guess they were too busy.) the fight choreography was done by cynthia rothrock's frequent co-star richard taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. he also tended to make cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in guardian angel when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. the dog almost out-acts her! she also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. the other actors are all over the map. you can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: "hey, me and some other guys i know are going to be in a movie. you wanna be in it too? no, dude, i'm serious!" then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is lydie denier, the stunning french model and veteran of "red shoe diaries," "baywatch," "melrose place," and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy french bombshell; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in baisez-moi or an "alias" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. there's also the tall, dark and handsome daniel mcvicar, now a regular on "the bold and the beautiful," john o'leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here, and aharon ipale, the veteran arab character actor perhaps best known as "pharaoh seti" from the mummy and the mummy returns. for these professionals, guardian angel must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. i gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial-arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. they're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was, and just enjoyed cheering cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged, high-kicking, stick-fighting thing. if you like this kind of flick, you could probably enjoy it on that level.

a female ex-cop who was drummed out of the force for recklessness (and who could probably beat chuck norris in a fight) hires herself out as a private bodyguard; her first client is a worthless playboy type. it takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place. lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers, and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue. give this one a miss.

i went to see "quitting" with high hopes, because the director's "shower" had impressed me so. despite a few lapses into mawkishness, "shower" ranks high on my list of all-time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction. and i've seen it at least three times now.but "quitting" fell flat, in my estimation. it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main character's insufferable personality that i was longing for the movie to end. i admit to falling asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so i think it's still ok to write this comment.i did admire the parents and sister. the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one i've never seen used before.disappointment aside, i will still make an effort to see any film bearing yang zhang's name, simply on the basis of the beautiful "shower."

amnesiac women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat (or a blouse?) are about the only stand-out points in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless. although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities, they are never developed to any satisfying degree, and exposition is almost non-existent. a large proportion of the film is mere wanderings through the corridors of a multi-storied clinic/hospital. the overall effect is bleak and sterile, a la thx-1138.

so far i disliked every single jean rollin movie i've seen, and that always bothered me because he's an acclaimed euro-trash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website; people whose opinions i always value and usually concur with. apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me. rollin's movies are unimaginably boring, they all feature the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogs are incredibly absurd, the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. i had actually given up on rollin's repertoire already (especially after enduring "the iron rose"), until i found out about "night of the hunted". allegedly, this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists. and the verdict is  yes and no! on one hand, this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive rollin film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far (and also the only one that i watching without dozing off). on the other hand, it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness. jean rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all. the unearthly beautiful lead actress brigitte lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen. during a nightly drive back home to paris, a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods. her name is elisabeth but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away. her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up. the next day, she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. elisabeth knows nothing, but she does sense she needs to escape from here. obviously i won't reveal the denouement, but i can assure you it is quite dumb, illogical and far-fetched. apparently rollin realized this as well, because the explanation is kept very brief and quick. there's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences, the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion, the nasty make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose. as said, the score is mesmerizing and brigitte lahaie's perfect body is addictive to glaze at.

as a fan of the old series i must say that this is at best a parody of a much beloved series. first the old series would at least attempt to follow some military structure. i know in this p.c. world it is not the thing to do but hey don't turn it into the care bears. in the old series beachead was a hardspoken soldier, now he is a teenage mutant turtle. another thing is the flying tank, ok it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the copter and they are both ok???? lets face it if the next one is not better this could spell the end of g.i.joe.

as a cartoon, the spytroops movie was pretty bad. it is only 44 minutes long, yet several battles occur culminating with the destruction of the cobra headquarters. one downer was the very beginning of the movie. an animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle simulation. that right there was a major turn-off and made the rest of the movie lack credibility. then there was the issue of shipwreck tied up along with his parrot, and tossed into some room where nobody had checked for several days. whatever happened to surveillance cameras?the cobra base only had a handful of characters, and the rest were bat robots. aside from a lot of corridors the cobra base did not seem to have any weapons, tanks, trucks, or any other equipment. then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. the plot was silly even if this was intended for small children. spongebob, powerpuff girls, and even barney the dinosaur give more attention to their plots.the characters were not bad, except that i could never understand anything destro was saying, and the cobra commander was silly and not much of a villain. in fact, except for storm shadow and xartan, the rest of the cobra characters were comical and hardly impressive. the gi joe characters were pretty good. scarlett, agent faces, road block and snake eyes were my favorites here. shipwreck and beach head were the worst. shipwreck is written as a goof-ball and beach head sounded like some 1990s surfer dude. i guess the writer, larry hama was trying to make a character that appealed to teenagers, but he was a decade off the mark. just listening to beach head's spicoli surfer-talk (fast times at ridgemont high) i was wondering if the new gi joes were going to smoke a dube before the big mission.the cgi was pretty good, except that cobra commander had a jerking spastic walk, and the vehicles did not look very realistic at all. the flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. old style animation would have been much better than this. since hasbro reportedly likes to do things cheap, they got what they paid for. i had trouble watching the whole thing, it was just boring and lacked any soul or gi joe spirit. even the old gi joe commercials would have been better. in fact, the dvd included extras such as four or five current commercials for gi joe spy troops, and those commercials were much more entertaining than the movie. the commercials had more kid-oriented fun and spirit. the commercials were lively, while the movie was dull.

although this movie is inaccurate overall, there are some items that may be true. certainly, he was a wild character in his youth, having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at west point, almost expelled several times, graduating last in his class (of 34), and often reckless in his leadership during the civil war.but history may have made him a scape goat of the indian wars. certainly, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? also, there is evidence that he testified before congress (at great risk to his commission and command) that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation! as a character said in the play 1776 when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war, the character states "history will do what it always does...it will lie." who knows how bad a man custer was. certainly he wasn't the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan. but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed.

i like errol flynn; i like biographies and i like action movies. this featured all three of these....but i didn't like this film. it just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent, especially in the photography with some great low- angle shots. however, i seemed like it took six hour to get to that point, and i really can't say why i feel this way. the action is interesting, errol flynn and olivia de havilland are fine. in fact, it was refreshing to see de havilland actually be supportive of flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him. yet something is lacking in this movie.the film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but i don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same. in fact, its rare when a film is historically accurate. for some reason, this revisionist history offended most critics. if the film had made general custer a lot worse than he really was, they would have probably liked it. well, too bad. in their twisted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. i really wish i could have enjoyed this more but i'll take a lot of other flynn adventures over this one.

the first time i watched this movie i was ten years old. i thought it was bad then, and at that age i had no cinematic taste whatsoever. i watched this movie on cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why i hated the movie in the first place. madonna's character, nikki, is annoying and obnoxious. there's no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her. the jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. soap opera!! i'm glad that i didn't see this movie at the theatre, or rent it. i feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me! madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.

the laughs are few and far between in this dull movie, and i can't help but wonder about how this mess ever got made in the first place. about the only good thing in this movie is the talent of griffin dunne, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by madonna's obnoxious performance. i was able to sit through this without getting too bored, but that's probably the nicest thing i can say about this time-waster.

as joe bob briggs would say, this movie relies a lot on the actresses' talents rather than their talent. this early 1990's show-the-babes-in-bikinis-fest has very little to redeem it, other than showing beautiful women nearly naked. joe estevez, martin sheen's little brother, proves once again that his movie career will be nowhere near what his brother's career is.avoid this one unless you like watching beautiful women in skimpy clothing. it's about the only thing that redeems it.

radio is possibly one of the best films i have ever seen while at the same time one of the worst. it made me laugh in places where you were supposed to cry, and made me cringe at moments you were supposed to laugh. it lacked any kind of character development which is usually crucial to a sentimental flick that this is. some questions, why did ed harris character take radio under his wing, this was not properly explained, and i'm sure their relationship(which is the main aspect of the film) is the most pointless if ever seen.who keeps on giving cuba gooding junior work, he is a crap actor and should be taunted heavily until he takes up another line of work.as true stories go, this is not that interesting. p.s the reason i said it is one of the best films i have ever seen, is because, despite it being complete pap, i still enjoyed it. laughing at the script, and most monologues which are truly the work of either am idiot or someone very clever trying to show how easy it is to release a crappy film about a retard who becomes everyones favourite joke. the fact of the matter is, cuba's character is comedy fodder for the people who watch the football matches.

i appear to be in the minority, but i thought "radio" was pretty awful. it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of "heartwarming" movies.the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained. we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad apples.you could see almost all of th big moments in the story from 100 yards away. when the movie wanted you to go "awww" or pull out your tissue, i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching "rudy" instead.there were some good performances by the cast. too bad they weren't given a better movie in wish to appear.

no offense to anyone who saw this and liked it, but i hated it! it dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot, also, too simple and the acting was so so...i would give this snorefest a 2 at the most

i am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving. not only is it hokey, manipulative, and melodramatic. it's also shamelessly offensive. the character of radio `gooding jr.' is paraded around as a cute little stuff animal, like a puppy that's so cute you just want to take him home.' this mentality is shameless; radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative device to draw sympathies from its audience. even more atrocious are the film's numerous moments, in which radio gets hit in the head/trips/falls over/etc. these moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because, `it's funny because radio is retarded' this is shameless, now i do not feel that the word `retarded' is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled, but this seems to be the stance the film is taking, `radio is retarded, but that's okay, because he's cute and we like him.' gooding's portrayal seems better suited for a john water's film than an inspiring family drama. to add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level, debra winger is uninspired in the role as the `stereotypical housewives' that the very reminder of her heinous monologues insights laughter in all who see the film. the score by john horner is pure sap always overlaying its tear some score over the tired cinematography. ed harris is decent in a role he could have slept through, but manages to retain much of the audience's attention throughout the film. in conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this travesty of a film, read the book, but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from american history.

this could have been a good tv-movie, but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie. as they give the viewer informations on the way (will the movie proceeds) i found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that in the beginning. then the whole trail would probably not have been necessary.when the movie ends you understand why she shot, and of course she is not guilty. too bad that the producer/director used the flashbacks this way, but on the other had the movie would not have been worth while at all.nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the evening.

am i the only one to notice that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is erroneous. actually it's a 15th century, right around 1620 if memory serves me, because the "realistic" ship in the movie is the mayflower, now as far as i know the mayflower never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia. i don't know who handled r&d for this film, but using the mayflower and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed.they even printed it on the cover art and the dvd. i wonder how may other people noticed this little blunder? not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful, i would have expected better from sam neill.

the vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a ripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. this random act violence sold it for me and i'm happy to say the rest of vindicator provided a veritable feast of cheese.the vindicator is about a scientist (david mcilwraith) who is nearly killed an explosion in his lab whose tattered remains are put inside an experimental body suit/armour. for some unfathomable reason he is fitted with a rage response activator, a device wired into his brain that will turn him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with any other person. they give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but i cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine. it is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit. what possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission? he predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit, along with the ninja assassin hunter played by pam grier (no, really).the vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy. it is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit. he also has a perpetually bewildered look in his eyes, that doesn't inspire fear or even compassion. i guess you can't blame him for that, most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces.the acting is of the really bad, stilted, 'i'm not sure what the character's emotions or thoughts are that this point so i'll take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random tone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera' school of acting. the actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part.it is after this initial accidental death that the vindicator goes after the scientists. strangely enough the whole rage response activator 'touch me and i'll kill you' thing doesn't play as big a role as you might expect with carl going after his former colleges in a reasonably detached manner. there was one scene where he rather brutally kills some street punks who push him around. i know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if he does look like c3po's retarded cousin. as it is they don't even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them. the only other time this rage response activator comes up in the movie is when old carl can't give his wife a hug. when hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so he'll be forced to kill her he casually remarks he has reprogrammed himself (off-screen naturally) so this doesn't happen. they could have left out the whole rage response activator thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it wouldn't have made a huge difference to the movie.there is an amusing sequence in the sewers as grier and her cronies track down the vindicator. due to his armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire 'vapourised acid.' for some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala ghostbusters. the vindicator fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of grier's goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out. the resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man hole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are. strangely enough grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the vindicator. this is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie, including the death of funky black scientist when the vindicator sends his van of a cliff. (this is after they capture the vindicator by trapping him in a giant lump of gello- no, seriously). there is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like a poor man's ned beatty, reveals his infatuation with carl's wife and tries to rape her. it goes on for about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wife's face, gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off. it is icky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence.the movies finale involves the vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits. for whatever reason all these other dudes are less kick-arse than carl, some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out. luckily for carl the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw. the only really memorable part toward the end is the death of grier. doing something i've never seen a baddie do in a movie before, in the middle of her confrontation with the vindicator she decides she really doesn't stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with his pistol.

"the vindicator" is a weird little canadian b-movie. at first glance it would appear to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "terminator" knockoff, but strangely enough it also shares some qualities with the original "robocop," which hadn't even been released yet when "vindicator" appeared (1986). coincidence? who knows? anyway, the story is thus: scientist carl lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a super duper secret government high-tech research lab, reporting to a sleazy boss named whyte, whom he butts heads with about project funding early in the movie. carl's got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "lab accident." but wait! carl's not really dead after all! whyte has extracted carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project, some sort of experimental bio-mechanical space suit. when carl wakes up inside his new body, he understandably goes a little nuts, trashes the lab, and escapes. this is a problem because whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with a "rage reaction" program, which will cause carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason. in hindsight, that little addition to carl's psyche was probably not the best idea.so robo-carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while, killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters, till he returns to his home and contacts his wife (this scene is supposed to be heartbreakingly touching, i guess, but turns out comical because carl's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says). he of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because she's in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. eventually whyte hires a gang of commando thugs led by "hunter," an apparent ninja assassin played by pam grier (!)to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation, using carl's wife as bait, and predictable (but laughably cheap looking) mayhem ensues.i'm a b-movie kind of guy but "the vindicator" was so half-assed that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly. i'm assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into stan winston's robo-carl suit design, because that actually looks pretty cool, but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap, made-for-tv kind of look. the script could've used a lot more work, but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of "robocop" going into production and rushed to get "vindicator" out so they couldn't be accused of ripping them off. either way, judging by the other comments here on imdb, i'm not the only one who's noticed the parallels between "vindicator" and "robocop," and obviously "robo" is the superior film, so there's no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described, at best, as a rough draft of "robocop" if it were made by an 8th grader.

it's times like these i truly wish i was a more avid reader of clive barker's literary repertoire, since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a movie of this stunningly 'visual' caliber. based on the novella "cabal", the story of "nightbreed" involves a behemothic amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic ghouls. a normal guy becomes linked to the strange world, called midian, through his dreams and his psychiatrist coerces him into believing he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months... thinking this to be true, he retreats to midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. the shrink, however, is right on homeboy's heals with a diabolical scheme to whip out the community of nightbreeds...wanting so much to love this movie, i was very let down in the long run. i have regretfully not read the story so barker's fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters was horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. i understand how the final cut was diced to hell and even barker show's moderate dislike for the overall product, but i just didn't "get" it. even if it is crucial to read the story, i feel like it should at least be translated to film in a way that it is still comprehensible for those unfamiliar with the literature. if "cabal" is as convoluted as this film than barker really milked a dead concept. couldn't help but feel a bit bored after a while, especially when things started getting increasingly ridiculous (somewhere around the jail scene i realized just how bored i was) - like a police department fearlessly going to war with midian like it happens every week! no one seems to think the idea of immortal monsters is a tad... strange. i did like the visual effects and all that crazy sh*t that went on in midian, especially that porcupine lady and that big headed sob... definitely an epic flick when you consider the massive quantity of effects and convincingly morbid decor. david cronenberg fills his position well as the loony shrink with his cool zipper-head potato sack mask, but we all wish he had done some behind-the-camera work to help save this heap... so, if you have a boner for clive barker material and fully grasp what exactly midian is, why they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (terrible idea!), and why these creatures reside there and how some punk kid shares a telekinetic link to it, you should probably check out "nightbreed". i'll look for "cabal" one of these days and hopefully gain some perspective... or maybe i'll just forget this travesty completely... until then, this is a poorly constructed and fairly tedious mess of a movie... watch "hellraiser" instead.

it's a bit difficult to believe that this came from the same director that gave us hellraiser. where's the style, the foreboding, and the charm? i mean, hellraiser is not a great horror film, but at least it had something. nightbreed is like a large ball of bad ideas poorly executed. from the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! the opening dream sequence shows too much for too long. our hero doesn't display professional acting skills (but no one expected that from this bastard genre). there are killings that one wishes were more interesting. then we have david cronenberg. the man was never really meant to be an actor. he fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist adequately, but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster. then we come to midian, a creepy fake graveyard with an over-creepy fake gate. this thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery in plan 9 from outer space. it gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. there is nothing really wrong with the character design and make-up effects here (well... except for the guy with no scalp, the guy with a pointy chin and forehead, and the fat guy with dark circles around his eyes), the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given them. barker's photography of the subterranean city is tired and this part of the story could have been made much better. some might call what follows spoilers. after our hero dies and becomes "nightbreed" we wait around to see what he'll turn into (there's talk of things that fly and werewolves), but when the time comes for him to change they appearantly thought their hero too pretty to give a decent creature design. with the turn in cronenberg's "character" the story just gets less interesting until the battle of freaks vs. norms (which is just bad). barker's mythology failed him here. there is no genius and little originality behind any of nightbreed. the picture could have used a larger budget, a serious script, and character design that doesn't leave you saying "oh...oh, how lame." what a waste. not scary, not cool, not even very dark, just weak.

you'd have more excitement cutting off your testicles than watching this, clearly a trick to get you to rent "descent" instead of "the descent", which is a much better movie.this is a total rip off of "the core" and much, much worse as regards special effects, i could do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of tinfoil, i mean come on!....that "mole" thing, bore more resemblance to a vibrating dildo than a subterranean vehicle .don't watch it - if you do you'll find the room your in has a funny smell for days after and you'll have this nagging feeling in the back of your head that you should go kill yourself or something.

i got subjected to this pile one wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching it. i can't get over someone basically doing a remake of a crappy high budget hollywood flop ("the core" with washed up actors like luke perry). if the high budget one flopped, what makes people think doing the same movie 2 years later with no budget would go anywhere? i was laughing through most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was (in fact i am shocked it's not held up in legal rather than airing on tv), and how it was basically the script of the core just redone badly, which if you have seen "the core", you know why doing it worse is funny, since the core was already so bad it was funny.if you enjoy getting a laugh out of really bad movies, this one will be right up your alley. the only thing i can say, is that i wish luke perry was able to have a career, because he isn't a horrible actor.. he just lands horrible roles. crappy made for tv movies that will only run on daytime television is pretty much one step closer to the end for him, if it wasn't for 90210 he would have a career.

for sci-fans this will be better than anything likely to be running on tv at any given time; that's about the best you can say of it. good points; repartee and sense of humour is less dull than usual in such movies, the plot is coherent and doesn't use any magical mystical revelations. bad points; the writers try to do good science but it falls down in direction and production (eg, a rock drilling mole using superheated rock drilling equipment breaks surface underwater with nary a bubble or boiling cauldron to be seen), the characters are cliché's and the plot unfolding is pretty stock standard. ok for a too-tired-to-do-anything-else type evening; but don't expect any major edification or even talking points really.

"the core" meets "crack in the world" (1965 made for tv). the acting is stock, the suspense predictable. once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from "the core" - basically the manned drilling machine - you end up with the plot of "crack in the world". "crack" was a truly excellent movie starring dana andrews. his team of scientists, working in south africa, drilled down to the crust and "punched through" with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy. one of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist disagrees. he believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole, but will instead form cracks in the crust. (possible spoiler) he is right. in order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. although i have placed a spoiler warning, i don't know if i really spoiled anything for either movie. and since "crack in the world is only available in very rare vhs format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter-blast works is probably academic.all in all, i rate "descent' just below average.

terry cunningham directs this sci-fi network original. all is not well in washington state and oregon; volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the pacific rim in the ocean. trying to keep the world from plunging in ecological havoc, a crack team of scientists led by dr. jake rollins(luke perry)take a massive earth drilling vehicle called "the mole" to chew its way to the earth's fiery core to avert impending doom. technical dialog doesn't really help or speed this movie along. the acting is lame, but then perry has always been laid back. you can only blame him for taking part. others in the cast: michael dorn, adam frost and michael teigen

the script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) "borrowed" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.but other than that, i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. it's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. far better than "supernova" which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. a note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. it would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.production values: almost passable. i've seen far worse in my time.a new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure. particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, "no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed." which is definitely not the case. a self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of "don't be so damn stupid in the first place." should you watch this movie? if you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. but do avoid "supernova" as i can assure you that you're not that bored. that definitely was not one of luke perry's better movies. this one is better. that's not saying much, but it is better.one dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.

this is a very very very bad movie !the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse.the special effects are unconvincing. the dramatic scenes are a joke. every step of the way you can see coming a mile away. the end is disappointing and there is no suspense. the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack.the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with.i do believe that the young female fans of luke parry will still see this movie however he has done better work. again this is terrible. very very very terrible. if you have a choice, look at something else.

this movie was so awful i don't even know where to begin...the only positive thing i can say about it is that luke perry gave a good performance. the entire movie was all over the place, there was no explanation as to the cause(only theories)of the eruptions, or rationals for their solutions or why it would work. it was ridiculous! all the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy, you just wanna laugh!! there was just no background to any of them. the "love" relationship seemed to have been added on to the script, it was so awkward. there's an army man; big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the "aaarrrgh!i'm the man!" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. the two sidekicks, who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys. and then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebody's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he's coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something...and then plays hero (cheesiest scene of all!!) to help the plan which is to do who knows what... its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene...in a nutshell; don't waste your time!

this movie is a great movie only if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it. as a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields. it is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the earth's surface. it also is funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. they seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage. also it is funny how much they make the coast line of washington state and also oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of southern california. the jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong. the director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2 "supossed" phd's.

this movie's script is indistinguishable from others, most notably the core, another bad movie. it's pretty clear why luke perry doesn't get much work, but to see the beloved lt. commander worf (michael dorn) resigned to something like this is just sad.i really can't think of one plot twist that isn't seen coming a mile away. that's not an exaggeration.special effects are very poor, even by tv standards. the lava flow at the beginning of the movie signaling the coming global disaster, starts things off at a very amateurish level. and it gets no better from that point on.

usual awful movie... i'll not bother you about the synopsis, just put together the core, armageddon, an evil-planner military officer and one or two solve-all nukes and you'll have the movie, if i can call it that way. seriously, nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives: the big one is approaching? nuke some places and it's over... a tornado wants to destroy "insert important city name here"? nuke "insert another important city here"... a volcano is erupting? nuke it! a nuke is near to go off? nuke it! coffee is cold? nuke it! you didn't like transformers? nuke yourself, but i can't assure this will fix things...in the end, how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another? i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke...

i just watched descent. gawds what an awful movie. right off the bat they depict a lava geyser and a note says that it is miles below the the surface of washington state. folks, there are no geysers deep in the earth like that. they thought it looked neat and in typical hollywood style they threw it in. and then there is that well that spewed lava. he dropped a stone and i heard a splash. steam would have erupted out of that well before a blast of lava could, if ever.and the acting was pretty bad as well. micheal dorn has sunk to a new low in jobs.what a dog of a movie. i bet the vote goes no higher than a 3.5it didn't look like scifi channel spent too much other than to have pretty boy perry as an attempt to draw.

i'm a pretty tolerable guy, when it comes to movies, even b movies. i routinely watch some b movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good, to just downright awful. i usually set my expectations really low before watching these types of movies, and even after doing that, descent was just downright awful. i really didn't mind that they were ripping off the core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. some scientists are worried about the earth's seismic activity, and must travel into the depths of the earth in order to stabilize the mantel. so what we get is a monotonously long set-up in which two dueling scientists played by luke perry and rick roberts have to work together on a top secret mission, named project deep. the man in charge, general fielding played by michael dorn, is secretly withholding vital information from assistant marsha crawford, played by mimi kuzyk. rounding out the cast is natalie brown who plays jen, a mission specialist who created the "mole" a drill which is used plunge into the depths of the earth.other than some pretty good special effects, and set designs, nothing about descent is worthwhile. the movie starts out fairly entertaining, but it gets bogged down quickly in a tiresome story about uncontrollable seismic activity, which has been done to death in other movies such as the core. descent also has a poor script, with useless, forgettable dialog between the characters. to make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. the attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny. the plot has gaping holes and some of the subplots are left untied at the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth. in closing this movie was just a cheap way for everyone involved to get a paycheck. there was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. other than some nice looking special effects, and set designs, this movie fails on every other level. the story is from the garbage can of hollywood, and the characters are uninteresting to boot. descent will simply descend you into boredom, and frustration. avoid at all costs.

this was pretty inevitable. this movie borrows from "the core" and from the film it borrowed from, "armageddon", and the films it borrowed from and so on. except this time there's luke perry too. this films version of the familiar save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes beginning in the pacific northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire. its soon determined that everybody on earth just might be doomed. so the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the earth and fix things (it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). there's even a line the tries to make the journey into the earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in "armageddon"). it's a sci-fi network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. there is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak cgi) special effects. not original and not all that entertaining. this is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, particularly if you've got beer.

on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic ,concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood, george lucas' american graffiti, we have cooley high. an adaptation of sorts by one eric monte, co creator of the popular 1970's cbs sitcom good times.cooley high was, and is, viewed as a black version of american graffiti.instead of central california ,as in american graffiti, we have the black slum of chicago's cabrini green as the backdrop for the story here. instead of america in 1962 cooley high is situated in 1964.the movie stars welcome back kotter's ,lawrence hilton jacobs and glynn turman as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters. it has garrett morris playing the principal who tries to keep jacobs' and turman's characters,named coceise and preach, out of trouble a great deal of the time.you know, i would like to say that cooley high is a worthy comparison piece to american graffiti or that it is a great film on its' own but i can't. the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad underside of black life in america.having the film in the cabrini green part of chicago doesn't help things.neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here. when coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet. when the gang visits the chicago zoo, one of the gang named pooter, has manure thrown on him by an ape. when the turman's character,preach, is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout(a dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at), he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! the high school, the homes of the characters, the bathrooms, just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty.if that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film. the use of violence and profanity in the film. cooley high may be an coming of age film ,but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american graffiti so much.motown records had a hand in making the film. the company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. but even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over. not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music,of that time period was more than just motown.especially in chicago. the song nearing the end of the movie, by the spinners' g.c. cameron, was not all that impressive. there have been better motown ballads that have been done, by better motown artists than cameron without question.the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film cooley high aimed to be ,american graffiti. it shows that preach,an intelligent but underachieving student went to hollywood and became a successful television writer. eric monte may have patterned himself as turman's character. the last shot of film show's preach running away from coceise's funeral ,held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the bleakness that cooley high came to represent. eric monte ,through preach and that final scene, had one little lesson for all of us when watching cooley high and for the love of the past. don't look back.

i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era - but i'd be lying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if i pretended that this big-screen spin-off is anything other than an abomination. the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there. by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father, moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant rage, most discerning viewers will have switched off. take that as a warning, unless you're keen on cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage.

-spoilers------------ i am a fan of 60's-70's french cinema but not necessarily of the more modern,so to be honest i watched this because of bellucci.she is very young here,extremely beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met with cassel,so it gives it some extra importance.the movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of depalma.then suddenly we are thrown to flashback,and the back and forth goes on which gets tiring.i don't mind one flash back,but do it and get it over with man!!!anyway,the movie is still interesting to me until a point when the first and definite hole in the plot,that allows for the rest of the story,never lets me enjoy the rest.i can allow for little holes here and there,but not to base an entire plot on hot air.this is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame.this is the main plot.i will go along,when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on,but in this story there's nothing really mysterious.bellucci-cassel are a couple ,then bellucci urgently has to leave for some job in italy(not the farthest place on earth from paris)and she leaves him a message,which for reasons later explained he doesn't get.ok,so what?don't these people have phones?supposedly she was away for 2months(not a century exactly) and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in paris to see how he's doing? of course not.instead,even after she gets back she forgets all about him.and thats fine,but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life.yet she failed to give him a call for 2months and then never tried to get back with him.and what about cassel's character?he was supposedly unable to locate her in italy,really hard to find someone in italy,its probably like siberia,especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts papers.and after 2months when she would be back,really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. one thinks she wanted to avoid him,but no,we find out they simply couldn't meet.so hard to meet in paris. ok,i don't need to go further,because this is the incident where the entire movie is based. what is even worse,bellucci is not really the star of this movie but this other girl bohringer is.

i love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie. however, in the first ten minutes of the movie i knew that it was going to be lousy. it was poorly acted and much too slow. on top of that it was very, very racist, sexist, antisemitic and homophobic. sometimes putting in racial, ethnic and other types of slurs has a point, illustrating the bigotry that exists. in this movie there was no point to the horrible bigotry and no one learned from what was being said. part of the problem is that it was an adaption of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950's. having this movie take place earlier in time would have made a little bit more sense. it didn't translate well to modern times and the writing was horrible. i don't know how the play was originally written but i can't believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one has made it to television and video in 1999. it was disgusting. don't waste your precious time on this one.

`afterlife' is about a somewhat arrogant, reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying, and finds himself looking after his sister, who has down's syndrome. he can't be bothered with her, and basically just wants to get her off his hands; he has better things to do. at one point he finds that he has to take her, by car (she doesn't like flying) across the country.if that all sounds familiar to you, it is probably because you have seen `rainman,' a film far superior to its imitator, `afterlife.' that it copies the basic premise (heck, it nicks a few characters and even scenes too) is not the fundamental problem with the film. the fundamental problem is that i did not care about these characters.the brother, kenny (kevin mckidd), is a bit of a womaniser. he has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story, and who learns to like the down's syndrome sister (again, this is taken from `rainman'). he is a journalist, trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal. when he ends up looking after roberta, the sister, he doesn't have much time for her, and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long. when she wanders off, he becomes even angrier towards her. am i spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a nicer, loving person by the end of the film?roberta is not determined to be 'normal'; she is 'normal,' and wishes people would stop treating her differently. she is played by paula sage, an actress who does have down's syndrome, and her performance is easily the best thing about the film; why did the screenwriter not explore her character more? well, probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story. when we surely already know the story anyway, didn't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating?for a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter (the father is absent; i think he is dead, but i'm not sure), it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer. the scenes are performed in such a standard, dull way, with such standard, predictable dialogue, that i found myself rolling my eyes.i have nothing against sentimentality in films, but it only really works if you care about the characters. here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that i didn't really think there was much to care about. `rain man' has an emotional climax, but that moved me, because i cared about the characters.talking of climaxes, this film has a stinker. there is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory; an unforgivably cruel trick is played on the audience. the sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the viewer. audiences aren't stupid, and they know when the film is cheating. what a cheap shot.there is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should. there are a few sequences that are funny, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, i can practically see the screenplay in front of me, moving predictably and uninterestingly, never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart. there are those phoney arguments that are reserved especially for the movies, where the other character knows exactly what the reply is. why don't supposedly 'realistic' films not realise that, in real life, anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can't express their emotions, and they might say things that don't make sense, or not be able to say anything at all? all of the actors in this film deserve better material. this film is not based on fact, but i think a documentary on a family with a down's syndrome member would be much more interesting. that way, we might have had truth and emotion. for some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something loudly and making a suitable facial expression.** (out of 5)

well, it wasn't a complete waste. armand was as usual very good in the movie,,,the whole turks vs german thing was kind of strange because i remember seeing bulgaria at the beginning of the movie...dint' bother to go back and check...the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in. never saw a movie where the characters looked italian, supposed to be turk, taking english(american accent and euphemisms) with german words. the climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me. in any case, if you have nothing else better to do, you can watch this movie..

first i have to say that i really love udo kier and have always had respect for armand assante but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie. udo does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible. the script is all over the place, the dialog is wooden, the "action" is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin. i really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself, "oh udo.....why???....why?????..". if you are a fan of udo or armand, please don't watch this movie. it will only make you sad for them.

this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen.the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenes.despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspect,her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell.anyway about the movie,well nothing really interesting to say,a neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol.while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town.armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes.the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie.the killing of the children,the involvement of the underworld,the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the "trial" of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie.the acting is terrible,the script just stupid,the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money.don't even bother renting this one.

i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made. a bulgarian-italian co-production set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all turks speak english with some turkish words in between, is hardly credible. the english vocabulary is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. apart from this, racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. and if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white. in order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face. i don't even believe they actually shot it in germany. there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shot. it's probably bulgaria with some german signs added here and there.

before watching this film (at a screening attended by the director herself) we were informed this had won the short film prize at the galway film fleadh. surely this result will give filmmakers hope, anyone can do better than this!how anyone cannot notice the flagrant rip-off of donnie darko in this i'll never know. the film is pure drivel, the acting cardboard, the dialogue ridiculous & the ending just flat! the only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how dreadful it was, in front of the director! yes that was mean, but liberating!at least irish film-making can't sink any lower!

this movie is just plain dumb. don't bother watching it; believe me, you're better off.long and short of the plot: a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children. in defending him, she comes across a wooden doll of pinnochio. she takes the doll home. pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people.this movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending. the plot is very bad and the dennis michael tenney's musical score is pitiful. the story, written by kevin s. tenney, is just pointless and evokes no horror or fear. this is a far cry from his work on night of the demons and witchboard, which are decent outings but nothing to write home about. his directing is ok, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good.in conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the blandest, most boring movie i've seen all year.

....you get this stupid excuse of a child's play rip-off! man, what were they thinking? first they mess with a rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make crap like this. fariy tale haters! well to be honest, i've seen this as a kid, and it scared me a bit a lot, simply because i was under aged with the assumption that pinocchio wouldn't do that, wah wah wah. but i've grown and come to think of this as child's play rip, a fairy tale bashing nonsense, and a lame tales from the crypt episode, or trying to be one at least, with a lame ending that was stupid, and it had many plot holes, and i still can't understand how it came to life. was it the work of an evil geppetto? then what, after a few evil deeds, he becomes a real boy who becomes america's most wanted? personally, i think the concept of an evil geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden killers, and starts a crime wave, funny. but this is awful, awful, awful, awful, awful! awful! stinky like a shoe, and awful! it sucked it sucked! if you want killer puppets, settle for the killer doll, specifically child's play, instead, no strings attached. or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down, watch leprechaun, or if you want pinocchio, watch the animated disnet version or live version with jonathan taylor thomas and martin landau instead. >>>>> -10/10(negative 10)

"ninja iii" is not quite as bad as "enter the ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. it will hardly please the fans of martial-arts movies, because there isn't enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence. as if the film wasn't already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic "the exorcist" rip-off. the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, which the director doesn't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher. i don't mind a little soft-core exploitation, but it must not pretend to be something else.

wow, this movie is bad. think "flashdance" with ninjas. the worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in midair, but you can see the strings. or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye patch (that looks like a coaster) that the good ninja wears. actually, there are so many bad parts, i can't make up my mind which is the worst. i can't believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made. the only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh at.

i saw this movie a few years ago, and man i never want to golf again. i mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved. and i'm not talking about "victimless" stuff like forging a scorecard. no no- based on what i've seen here, they shamelessly massacre policemen and golfers alike on hallowed country club grounds. judge smailes would be spinning in his grave. and do they repent for said sins? no no, based on what i have seen here, the typical response by a slain ninja is to take over the body of a buxom female telephone repairwoman and seek revenge. i find this morally reprehensible, and needless to say, after viewing this nonsense, i not only stopped golfing and talking on the telephone, but also decided to stop feeding the homeless.

following the movie that represents the pinnacle of the 1980's ninja genre namely, 'the revenge of the ninja' salivating fans were 'treated' to this bizarre offering that mixes ninja shenanigans with spiritual possession....the end result being not dissimilar in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a nugget of human poop floating menacingly towards oneself in a public swimming pool.take for instance the supposed 'action packed' introduction which is set of all places on a golf course(!) here we witness an evil green clad ninja slaying a group of golfers for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever (although i must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does irk me somewhat though...hmmmm perhaps that's why he murdered them?.....yep i can relate to that after all). actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist but this story line is never elaborated upon nor alluded to ever again!!!anyway back to the intro, the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin....and they have to keep on shooting him because he just won't stay down!!! yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and still he gets up to slay evermore of the law enforcement numbers.finally (after what seems like an eternity) our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappears.....or so it seems, for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the soil and upon our decidedly gormless officers leaving the scene to search for his body, he crawls out from hiding and staggers away.we next see the lovely lucinda dickey, a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition, here playing a telephone repair worker. from her high vantage point she happens to spot the dying (at last!!!!!) ninja. however, upon closer investigation the man, supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and grapples her to the ground. after a bit of a struggle our feisty heroine manages to break free luckily but doesn't count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them. it is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! his intention is to use her corporeal form to slay those officers who killed him (the few he didn't actually manage to wipe out initially!)from this point on, throughout the film, whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some overwhelmingly awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed unto her levitating towards her in a most wobbly manner!to make matters more complex, a particularly irritating police officer (who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average yak to shame!) persists in trying to win her affections (in a most bloody annoying manner!!!)......well of course it doesn't take the gift of preconception to work out that in a rather feeble 'shock' (less) twist towards the end of the film, he is revealed to be one of the officers she must slay!but wait there's some hope yet! step forward the one and only sho kosugi!yes, the ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever! golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that transpired there, he flies all the way from japan to sort the situation out (suspecting the worst!) in a brief sub story (that amounts to all of a few seconds!) sho's interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered sho's father/teacher(?) and blinded one of sho's eyes (thus necessitating sho to wear a really decorative looking sword guard eye patch!)after stealing his dead nemesis's body from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an unwitting abode for the evil soul, matters climax at an oriental temple (seemingly in the middle of nowhere) where our man sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects.now reanimated from the dead, the evil ninja and sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being........well yes you can probably guess.really this movie has only two things going for it, namely the always excellent kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always) and the lovely miss dickey. what a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a rancid pile of ordure.oh well, to be fair, i've seen a lot worse than this in my time although i certainly still can't recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their sho kosugi/ninja movie collections.

...and boy is the collision deafening. a female telephone lineman is taken over by the spirit of a recently-deceased ninja, strips down to her undies, pours tomato juice on her body so her boyfriend can lick it off, performs a seductive dance, then goes off to kill the policemen who killed the ninja she's possessed by. only to be hunted down by a one-eyed ninja master. just like in real life, eh? enlivened only by sho kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his declining to put his obnoxious kids in this one), you really have to see this to believe it. it's the ultimate mix of totally at-odds genres.

you can only describe this with one word and that would be wow!!! wow, i really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released. if you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists, right? however, none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that's the level of their martial arts skills! the actors are way overacting, the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense. this is the worst martial arts movie i've ever seen and i have seen plenty!

i remember catching this movie on one of the showtime channels. what stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in phoenix, arizona. i'm from there so i spot the locales easily.regardless, a ninja kills a scientist, because they wear yellow sweaters and golf, who is pursued by the police. it takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him, there are no discernible bullet wounds. his spirit lives on however when a woman finds her and touches his katana.from then on, she periodically gets possessed and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja. then another ninja from japan comes to kill the evil ninja. this might be a plot device from the previous two films, or perhaps a plot hole. all i know is that this movie is very campy, bad and entertaining. this is something to watch with a tub of popcorn, and several friends and give it the mst3k treatment.

you know, after the first few chuck norris movies, i got so i could tell that a movie was produced by golan-globus even if i tuned in in the middle, without ever looking at the credits or the title. what's more i could tell it was golan-globus within a minute of screen time. something about the story structure, the goofy relationships between the characters, the mannered dialog, the wooden acting (spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance), the scene tempos and rhythms that made albert pyun look like john mctiernan, the paper-thin plots and not-ready-for-prime-time fight choreography...golan-globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject matter and point-of-view.what can you say, it must work for them, since they've produced literally dozens of movies. you go to one of their productions, and you know exactly what you're getting. and it ain't brain food, folks."ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a long line of products from the g-g sausage factory, and offers the typical limited pleasures to the movie-goers' palate. you've got a bad ninja, slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. you've got a good ninja, pledged to stop him. you've got a westerner thrown into the mix so we americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured that "we can still beat those pesky orientals at their own game." you've got a love interest (who is usually also the worst actor/ress in the film) fencing with the hero. you've got your endless string of assaults, assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an arrow or throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye, neck, or chest. you've got your beefy white guy/bodyguards in suits calling a ninja a 'son of a b*tch' and throwing a roundhouse punch, only to get his *ss handed to him. you've got a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy which goes on for 20 minutes and just sort of stops like a roadrunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolution.ninja 3 is a little different, in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the bad ninja, so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and beefy white bodyguards in suits while under his spell. but all the other elements are there, as formal in their way as a kabuki play or a noh drama.i actually thought lucinda dickey was pretty likable in this film. she's nicely muscled and curvy, has great cheekbones and some athletic 'ooomph' to her movements, and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie. she can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. one extra start for her participation and good energy.naturally, sho kusugi is in here, and he pretty much dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. and just to show you how 3rd-rate and uninspired g-g movies are, the director and editor inter-cut the last climactic fight between kosugi and the bad ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement. i'm serious...for all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings, they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at marineland. i can only imagine how dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katana for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot. an enjoyable waste of time...but it definitely is a waste of time. maybe if you are a sho kusugi fan, or even a linda dickey fan you'd find it worth your while.

this is by far the worst movie ever made. i have no doubt. i have seen such crap as manos, space mutiny, and whatnot, and i can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle to science crazed.science crazed has no discirnable plot. something about a guy making a woman pregnant via turkey baster, and the child born *hours* later is fully grown, and ready to kill. of course, being a newborn, it takes him about an hour to kill people. the director loops footage constantly, and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death. there is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie, however the dialogue arrives about a minute after it is spoken.sample scene: the monster is walking down a hall. we know this because there is about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet. in between loops, we are treated to two women working out. repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. when the monster does show up, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in headlights as the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them. by the level of the acting, you would guess that the people are already dead.i know my description doesn't seem too bad, but trust me, i can not fully describe the pain that is science crazed.stay away, and boycott all video stores that carry it. :)

this is just what we need, a show about the people nobody likes in high school or in university. man or woman. people objectifying others and congratulating themselves for doing so is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. and this show is just disgusting for doing exactly that.so four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys try and pick up women to have sex with them. and in the end one of the two wins, great...just f-n great. i'm also supposed to accept these four douche bags as being "judges" of people's "game". the term "game" has got to be the most moronic thing to come out of modern english since the term "bling bling", added to the fact that these men are called the "experts" just makes me want to throw up whats left of my respect for modern culture. these are not god damn role models, they are the result of mtv culture coming to bite us in the ass. if you enjoy the bullshit spilling out the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think paris hilton and britany spears have talent. its not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking so.and for all those people who will say that i would like this better if i got laid, or that i'm just jealous. go screw yourself, because its obvious that a real girl certainly won't.

one of the many silent comedies stan laurel featured in before he teamed with oliver hardy, 'mud and sand' is a ho-hum hokum. the story is badly disjointed - though this could be because of the modern-day edit - and the humor itself is not at all inventive.potential plotlines are started and ignored; for instance, stan's promise to make fillet de sole pay for what she's done to him never comes to fruition. stan's character doesn't seem very centered, either, but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed 'stanley' of laurel & hardy fame, so it might be that i was just expecting to see this shortcoming.i strongly believe that all the silent films should be preserved and viewed, and i'm glad this one is still available. it's just not a great film.

worst movie i have ever seen! 90 minutes of excruciating film-making. all the ingredients to make this movie a true work of crap. bad acting, bad directing, bad storytelling, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects, and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. it also threw in a terrible naked shot of a dumb blond, and a breast shot of a stupid asian girl, and both attempts were just scary, since these girls are ugly. some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but this could never be considered one of them. kevin tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling: he introduced characters at the end of the movie (an old man and old woman). i would vote for it below a 1 out of 10 but the voting system doesn't work that way apparently. right from the title sequence i knew it would suck and i would return my dvd but best buy doesn't refund dvds, or consumable products as they call it, or so my receipt says. i have "the dunwich horror" and that was truly god-awful, but i still feel that "night of the demons" (an obvious evil dead rip-off) was far worse than "dunwich horror." this is just like "the howling," how in the hell could sequels get milked out of this anorexic cow??? save your money and get the "texas chainsaw massacre" (just don't get any of its sequels though) or "the evil dead" or "dawn of the dead." "night of the demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. every second of it was just maddening, excruciating pain for the audience, because the whole movie all-around was horrible! do yourself a favor, don't see it! you'll be saving some brain cells.

and you know why? because they thought (or at least made horror fans think) that a bunch of obnoxious, foul-mouthed, screaming teenagers, some stupid demons (where do they come from? what is their purpose? who knows?) and a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie. needless to say, they were wrong. you also need a script, some logic, some rules, and some invention. this flick does have one scene that lives up to its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course), and a couple of funny moments (the kid brother's description of his mother's cookies, linnea quigley's "don't look at me" scene). it also has more profanity than any movie i've watched since i last saw "reservoir dogs". literally every fourth or fifth word is a "f***" or a "b****". then again, when a movie begins with four false scares in its first 5 minutes, you know not to expect anything resembling good filmmaking. (*1/2)

dear friends, i've never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons (1988). it seems that the director kevin tenney had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam raimi (1978) or george a. romero's return of the living dead from the same year. the cinematography was lousy, the movie was very dark, so i had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. indeed, horror pictures have to be dark, but not the way like night of the demons. the entire movie was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except alvin alexis in the role of rodger, and horrible make-up effects. an average vote of 5 stars for that movie? i can't believe this. perhaps the users were pleased about the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were indeed worth 5 stars. regards, hans-dieter

when i first saw this i thought bits of it were fairly scary. but the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them. there are some genuinely good moments such as angela's speech about demons, and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective. but this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis. it's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly, pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror. the music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is certainly amusing, but this film doesnt have much to recommend it, just comes across as another jason-type stalk-and-slash fare.

it's difficult to decide whether this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if it's just made to appear so by crap actors. in any case it suffers from storywriting which is mediocre at best.although made in the late '80's, the first part of the movie plays like a 60's teenage screwball comedy (barring the absence of any actual humour), especially the part of the 'good girl', which is as annoying a doris day figure as you could hope/fear for, including the slightly whiny opposition to anything 'fun' her friends want to do. the net effect is, after a while you start to hope she'll bite it so you don't have to listen to her voice anymore.some profanity and gratuitous nudity, plus some really 80's style clothing is your only clue that this movie was made in the 80's. oh, and some pretty passable music, too.storywise, it's pretty formulaic stuff. a bunch of horny (apart, obviously , from 'miss nice girl') teenagers decide to celebrate halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house. partying and fornication ensues, along with an ill-advised 'seance' which kicks off the demonic possession spree which is the subject of the movie. after this, the only suspenseful part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will expire. you're sure not to care whether or not they will. the actors are so bad that becoming demons/zombies/dinner actually improves their performance somewhat, and the ridiculously cliché dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in your seat.gorewise, this flick ain't nuthin' special, unless you think cheesy is kind of 'special'. for example, the demon head which occasionally appears is so screamingly fake that you wonder if it's a 5-year old trick-or-treating.this is not to say there's nothing enjoyable in the flick. some of the music isn't half bad, and the first of our insipid scooby gang to get possessed performs a marvelous and really sexy dance routine at one point, before she turns nasty.also, and i don't know why, towards the very end of the flick, i actually managed to get somewhat involved. the suspense lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance, and i started to squirm out of unease instead of annoyance. which is what a horror movie is supposed to do.concequently, i cannot bring myself to give this movie a rock-bottom rating, since by some inexplicable miracle (i don't rule out being possessed by demons) i was actually a little creeped.don't pay money to see it, though. it's hardly worth your time, yet alone hard cash. watch it on youtube while it's there.

this film is about a party put together by the high school "scary girl." per the illogic of these sorts of films, she gets permission to hold the party at a house which used to be a crematorium, a dubious place long shut down and locked up. apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left unspoken of among proper folk though the legend does get whispered about among the young.why was this crematorium really shut down? what actually happened there in the past?i like these kill-kill-kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films. the highlights of this film are a petty theft "7-11" robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view, the changing clothes scene by the "good girl" witnessed by her jerk younger brother, the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural; the best part of this film is when the possessed party sponsor dances to bauhaus in front of the fireplace; that scene rocks.

this film contain far too much meaningless violence. too much shooting and blood. the acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor. the only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars.

by the time this movie came out in 1996, director mark lester had been making tight, sharp little b action pictures for more than 20 years. he was responsible for the great "truck stop women" from the '70s and several other little gems; unfortunately, he's also responsible for this dud. it's a shame to see the talented--and still smoking hot--theresa russell wasted yet again, but she's still the best actor in this picture. eric roberts shows up for a while, does his eric roberts thing, then goes away, a not altogether unwelcome occurrence in a picture with eric roberts in it. frank stallone actually isn't bad, which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is. as has been mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes--which is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first place--are almost completely illogical and unrealistic, in addition to being somewhat inept. other than some "vintage" clothes and a few old cars, there's no feel whatever for the 1930s, the era in which this film is set. a by-the-numbers script with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracy--this isn't a documentary, of course, but the filmmakers could have at least tried for a little authenticity--and performances that range from grade b to grade school relegate this cheap little quickie to the 4:00 a.m. sunday slot on hbo, which is just where i saw it.

it's too kind to call this a "fictionalized" account of the barker gang. they got the names right, but that's about it.russell is still hot, i'll grant you that, but this is not the real ma barker, who basically took care of the boys by cooking and assisting when they moved around the country, not by planning or participating in the crimes. i think it would have been far more interesting to present the real story of a middle-aged woman caught up in the criminal activities of her children and their cronies.i also have to agree with those reviewers who found the shoot-out scenes to be totally unbelievable. the barker/karpis victims were a combination of the innocent and of the law-enforcement agents who pursued them, but they definitely did not mow down half-a-dozen fbi agents every time they were cornered. (on the other hand, as several recent books have related, the fbi of that era emphasized the idea of agents coming only from legal or accounting backgrounds to the extent that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearms experience. they were not the well-trained agents that we picture today.) but the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore. nobody changes, nobody grows. we know the end of the road is ahead, we just don't know which shoot-out it will be.only for die-hard russell fans.

is this movie as bad as some claim? in my opinion, yes it is. i wasn't going to comment, noting that quite a few comments have already been made, ranging from 'awful' to -not nearly so bad...'. however, i can't resist.what do you make of a movie that has, on the dvd cover. the phrase "the real story of "ma barker and her boys...", and the standard "any similarity to actual persons..." disclaimer in the credits? i'm not naive, but in this case, it's a pretty relevant observation regarding this movie.several comments knock the performances. they are pretty awful, roberts, russell, milano and stallone have something like 315 movies and tv shows listed between them. they can act, or at least perform.however...the dialog is not to my taste, and quite unintentionally funny at times. the story arcs didn't seem to be anything but the barest minimum required to string specific scenes of violence and melodrama together.direction and screen writing has to be faulted: amyrillis giggles after seeing ma barker's violent temper and finishes with "take the girl!"?????. what ever you think of alyssa's acting abilities...some screenwriter wrote that line or reaction, and/or some director shot it, and said, 'ok, that's good enough, no need to retake that, that's credible...' one footnote: i did pick up my copy for $1.99 or $2.99 in a grocery story discount bin; the running time is shown as 91 mins, and i note that the running time is listed on imdb as 95 mins. i don't know what 4 minutes i'm missing, but i acknowledge that if those 4 minutes were of the right sort of person in the right sort of situation, my rating might soar to 3 or 4 out of 10. as i saw it, 1 / 10 is what i must vote.

wow, pretty amazing that something this bad could actually be made. i am giving this movie a 2 because it is so bad it has a certain "car wreck" kind of appeal. its so bad its comical and that does have a certain entertainment value. plus there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and that is always appreciated.so where do i begin. the acting is beyond awful, its like you are watching a high school play being filmed. theresa russell must have done something really bad to have been forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess.the rest of the cast is simply silly with the casting of dan cortese as an fbi agent the cherry on the top of this piece of crap. his acting actually had me laughing at loud.as for the screenplay and the directing c. courtney joyner and mark l. lester should simply be taken out back and shot.

some people may remember ms. russell from films such as "black widow", which had some appeal and critical acclaim. boy, she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this dog.yes, there will be those who like the gratuitous violence and nudity. but one must sit back and wonder, in retrospect, what possessed anyone to spend money and time to make this in the first place. i just saw this movie on one of the "hbo's", and i can't believe they picked it up.in 1996 ms. russel didn't have the physical attractiveness she did earlier in her career. but, come on! having her play ma barker??? her "sons" all look like they could be her brothers. it's also creepy in that you think there are going to be incestuous relationships occurring (thank goodness there aren't, hope that doesn't count as a spoiler). with eric roberts and alyssa milano added into the cast, this one is b-movie 'straight to video' all the way.the scenes between purvis and ma barker, either in person or on the phone, are a primer in terrible, terrible acting. oh, wait, i forgot terrible, terrible writing as well. chalk this one up to experience. a bad experience.

as a michigander, i got the michigan jokes. very funny - make fun of pontiac, ann arbor, all those lame suburbs of detroit. yes, yes, i've heard these jokes a million times. i'll give them credit for accurately depicting the lameness of grosse pointe. it couldn't get more white. did you hear those lovely michigan nasal accents? where the girls talk so fast you can't understand one word that comes out of their mouth (nose)...? as much as i love michigan, i hated this movie. i have never met one person from grosse pointe that i liked. listen to that awful live band and that annoying and horrid background music! what is that? one of your gross pointe homeboy's band? probably. wow, what a great "detroit scene" you guys have over there. funny how people from grosse pointe always say they're from detroit. they're so white and rich, they wish they had something to complain about.anyway, this movie blows. all the way from the lame jokes about girls in thongs to the terrible character development. oh wait a minute, you mean the entire basis for a character is that he says the f-word a lot? what a deep personality. great job, grosse pointers! and i love all the sexist lingo, like how the narrator calls the first girl who gets killed that we never even hear speak a "naive b*tch". that's really lovely.and those homemade masks with the marilyn manson contact lenses are really great. and i love how it made perfect sense as to why the bikers came by and killed people. and how their narrating master had such a obvious role in the movie... ?? the main boyfriend dude was so boring i fell asleep looking at him. the three idiot guys (or was it two or four? how can i tell, they all look and act the same!) were so desperately trying to make me laugh, but beavis and butthead already got out my butt humor laughs back in 1994. and what's with the gay jokes? no wonder this movie sucked - everyone involved must have some minor problems with their masculinity, eh boys?the only saving grace to this film was the main girl. despite what the other people on here have said, she actually was a good actress. teenage girls talk the way she talked. they really act the way she acted. her acting was very natural and believable. i really thought she was a grosse pointe convenience store employee. .. maybe she is! and yeah she had big boobs, most the women here do. michigan is the fattest state in the union, you know. in all aspects.so, those of you who think this is a representation of detroit, it's not. it's the suburbs of detroit. they are very white and full of aimless teen angst. limp bizkut, icp (yes, icp is from one of our suburbs) and $75 baggy khaki pants all the way! lame rich kids who are mad because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about. and they make bad movies, too.

evil never looked so bad. they meant it.when a buddy of mine picked this dvd up at a half-priced book store, i didn't know what to expect. i mean, based on the title, i knew it would be worth a laugh, but i didn't realize how laughable it would really be.the first time through, i missed some of the dialogue (if you could call it that) because we were all too busy poking fun at the plot of the movie. it seemed like it was written in filmed in less than a week, and they hadn't the budget to go back and fix some of the minor flaws. wait, did i say "minor"? i meant the exact opposite. for instance, the main character is credited as 'ken', but several times throughout the film he is referred to as 'john'. if the plot holes aren't enough fun for you, take a look at the acting. nobody seems overly concerned about the zombie raids in their state, including the mother of the main character, who is missing for days while she sits in front of a fireplace reading a book.the constraints that the budget puts on the movie are equally as hilarious. maybe they didn't have a permit to film wherever they were, because during the big motorcycle chase scene, the characters are obeying all traffic regulations. the zombies, who had just killed twenty or so people, actually stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot. i don't even do that, but then again, i'm not a biker zombie. the ending of the movie looks like they just ran out of money. it ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more... on second thought, it ends just soon enough.so if you're looking for a good time with your friends, seek out this movie. it's a great unintentional comedy.

i rented this pile of sewer waste hoping for a few good laughs. with a title like `zombie bikers from detroit' and with dead alive productions stamped on the front cover, you would think that this could be a funny/gruesome film, but no. this is the worst movie i have ever seen (and yes, i have seen all of the police academy movies). the story (this is a joke within itself) and the dialogue are atrocious. the make up of the so-called zombies looks like they used one of those two dollar `make yourself look like a zombie' kits that you buy at k-mart.i would rather watch beverly hills 90210 while listening to the backstreet boys and be whipped by a 400lb novelty birthday card model than to sit through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a dvd. honestly, i could make a better movie with $3, some popsicle sticks and a slinky. i feel as if 90 minutes of my life were stripped away from me and taken to the land of suckdom. i know that tagging on the dead alive production doesn't guarantee a great flick, but you do expect to get your moneys worth.the only thing that made me happy (save, returning the horrid mass of elephant feces) was that it wasn't titled `biker zombies from pittsburgh'. i feel for detroit folks that wasted their hard-earned money on this one. unless you have been lobotomized . do not buy, rent if you must  but . you will regret it.

ouch, no real need to say anything else. this movie actually had me contemplating suicide. as a huge fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies i found this to quite possibly be the worst attempt i have ever been privy too. the film never actually seemed to go anywhere! what was the point to it all, i am left feeling hopeless and lost. hell this was so bad i cant even justify bashing it anymore. i'm just gonna go hang myself in the closet. ok now i tried to submit my comment but the server will only accept comments that are ten lines or more. so here it goes... bad, horrible, no where near enough gore. no tits!!!!!!how can you have a zombie movie without tits. as a matter of fact the female lead had one hell of a rack and the only reason i watched the film to completion was in order to maybe by chance get a glimpse. nope! of course there was one line that does deserve mentioning, a line i am looking forward to using myself someday (when i just feel the need to get my face smacked) "this hog isn't going to smoke itself" this movie is bad, so bad.

recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the dvd made me realize that this was a local movie. the word detroit in the title furthered my suspecions and i did some looking up of things and yes, a local movie it was.so i picked it up. someone i knew actually knew some of the producers/director (dont remember which) and said the producers/directors got people to pay to be in this movie.brilliant! what a great idea. the movie makers get some capital to do the movie with, thanks to their cast and crew. then the investors (cast, crew, others) get some of the profits, i'm imagining.profits!um anyways. this film totally underwhelmed me. the special effects were special as in special children who ride the small buses to school. the acting was very amusing, not intentionally however. there's a great line where a guy says "well? this bone aint gonna smoke itself!" as a pickup line. unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film. the story? well, i sort of followed it about 3/5 of the way in, then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it, it suddenly ended. i mean as in,..no resolution of anything..like they ran out of time. "sorry folks, out of time, goodnight!"we sat there baffled and booing, and threw in another film. then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine showed up..with one of the guys from the movie! we threw it back in and he (the actor) gave us a running commentary, which was awesome because he totally ripped on the movie!what more could you ask for??the most absurd scene for me was a motorbike chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all. that and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl. in pain! the zombies looked less like zombies than my coworkers do. and i dont work at the morgue either.so, i recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the fun.otherwise, give this one a pass. rent something like feeders if you want a jaw droppingly bad in a funny way movie...

i'm big into acting, writing, and directing, but not famous yet. my friends and i frequently rent bad movies, just for fun and a good laugh, but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called biker zombies from detroit, we knew it was gonna be the worst movie of all time and it was! biker zombies from detroit has no script! they can say they do have one, but they're liars! there was a 4 minute scene of just two guys riffing about women and sexuality, and you could tell it was improvised. and if they're going to improv, it should be at least decent, but it wasn't, and you could tell by the two actors screwing up lines and saying stuff that didn't even make sense.to give you an idea of how terrible and retarded this movie is, here's the beginning: a girl flicks a guy off, he punches her in the face and beats her up, then rapes her. then we see zombies who attack and they both turn into zombies.this is the beginning of the movie! not to mention the lead zombie voice over that carries through the whole movie, trying to be sinister and thought provoking, but sounding like marylin manson having a conniption fit.worst movie ever. bottom line, folks. but watch it if you like movies with no script, no plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music, and over 100 f words used in the movie.if this can hit video stores, my future films are gonna win oscars.

any movie should have an idea; simple or more complex, it needs one... the problem with fragata,..it's once more, that when he decides to make a movie, he so anxious to do "whatsoever" that he forgets this main detail, and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification, behaving without justified reasons...they are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind. it's boring and sad to see them appearing and vanishing like cards being discarded in a game. fragata always seem to have talent in advertising is own work...and that leads you to see what he did...but in the end there's always a big disappointment. it's not enough having a movie full of the "hot portuguese's pink magazine stars"...especially when half of them can't act...they only pretend to be funny. here my only good point goes to the actor helder mendes...one of the few non stars': he makes the effort to establish some credibility, and in such a messy movie without any direction (of any kind) i give him the credit for trying hard. but this movie its worth to check out as a manual of "how to not do a movie"...and if fragata's previous works where bad...this one it's a "masterpiece" in achieving the title of awful. in few words,..just check it out! it will make you good,...and if you homemade your family movies,...and always feel bad with your work...so just spend 30 minutes looking to this so "called" professional work...your home made stuff will look like powerful hollywood flicks compare to sorte nula.

who reads these comments may think we may have in hand a great movie. i am portuguese and i'm ashamed that this film became a blockbuster in portugal. it can't really call this cinema. the direction and "mise-en-scene" is basic (even ron howard does better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a really bad tarantino); the cast is covered in tv stars, models and reality show stars that don't no nothing about acting. when you put in a movie this ingredients of course that the fans of this kind of tv shows will all go see. i am also surprised that people who make comments here in imdb say that this movie is a masterpiece. i thought that this site was only for people who truly like cinema and understand a little bit of it. all the movies made to be blockbusters in portgal always use the same ingredients and are always awful. if you think this movie is reasonable, please don't say your love movies and cinema.

terrible. there's no way to get around it. a script at the level of one from some mexican soap opera, a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time, repetitive and monotonous, with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast. the references to tarantino's work, so poorly made, are more an insult than anything else. i suspect that was not for the shameless and plot-unrelated exploitation of matadinho's generous curves , nobody would take the effort to go watch this film to any theater.these are the kind of films that make me have no desire to watch portuguese cinema.

some films are so badly made they are watchable purely for the cringe factor. disciples made me cringe so much it was uncomfortable. i watched it all disbelieving what i was watching, wasn't anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming? mix the most hammed performances from the most wooden actors, an abysmal script were every comment from all of the 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried (and failed bigtime) to give the film a forced pace. all these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return. avoid at every cost.

this tvm seems to have polarised opinions amongst the commentators on this page so perhaps i can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie . how bad is it ? it's a teleplay that can't even decide what its name is because while everyone in america calls it linda it's known in britain as lust for murder and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name . and can i also point out that it's not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed i will be honest and say the plot is rather sound . linda and paul cowley meet another couple called the jeffries who they get on very well with . they get on so well that they go on holiday together ( make up your own mind if there's some wife swapping going on ) and paul sees his wife kill the jeffries . after that the plot takes a shock twist writing the above paragraph i have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and i won't say anything to put you off the premise . it's just that when the story continues after the events i've described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre . not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing paul cowley doing a very wooden voice over that irritates while most of the scenes - exterior and interior - look like they've been filmed on a foggy day

years ago, i caught a fairly well made tv movie entitled "linda". it was made in 1973, and starred stella stevens in the femme fatale title roll. imagine my surprise when, over ten years later, i once again saw the same story unfold on late night tv. however, it was this 1993 version, starring virginia madsen. don't get me wrong, i can handle remakes, even obscure ones. but this badly written and poorly filmed retread made me feel sorry for both madsen and co-star richard thomas. unlike the original, the dialogue here is cliched, making me wonder, "why did they bother to re-write it?" second, the camera work is very heavy-handed, and the the film stock is poor. at times i felt reminded of the student film competition at the beginning of christopher guest's "the big picture". finally, the cast looks either bored (madsen) or suffering (thomas). in fact, the only one who seems like he's really enjoying the work is ted mcginley. of course, with his perfectly coifed hair and capped teeth, he's really stretching himself from his previous work on "the love boat". bottom line, to borrow a critique from opus the penguin in bloom county:"this movie does for film what jonestown did for kool-aid."thomkat

what an uninteresting hodge-podge. it could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or the direction. a man is framed for murder by his wife and her lover. the conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty. but the man (richard thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "unimaginative", manages to escape from jail, beat it to the conspirator's beach house, and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it. he shows a heck of a lot of creativity and improvisational skill for an unimaginative guy, if you ask me.the tape is now damaged goods but it's enough to break down the wife's lover and he sobs out his confession. bad people are punished. good people are saved.the location shooting is impressive. the beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of fort fisher battlefield on the cape fear peninsula. the house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped.it's a pretty place. unfortunately it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. it's all very fuzzy. and for all the natural splendor of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place, of what the sand feels like, of the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens.the acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with. the best performance, as is often the case, is given by dick olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer. virginia madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. ted mcginley is within his range as an immoral weakling.the musical score neatly blends the ominous with the mysterious and is effective. if you want to hear the original, from which this was ripped off, rent hitchcock's "vertigo" and listen to bernard hermann's suspenseful theme.i can't think of any particular reason to catch this one except utter boredom.

based on the excellent novel, watchers by dean koontz, is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone. not since "the running man" have i seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition. the difference, however, is that "the running man" film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases. this film nope, nothing remotely amusing. in fact, if you love the book, as i do, you'll hate this bastardization even more.**warning**contains spoilers** rightio, i'm basically going to tell you the story here, almost in it's entirety. why? because you, dear reader, do not also need to suffer through this abominationit's okay for me, because i enjoy watching crap. because i like complaining about sh*tty things. now, on to the nasty: this film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature-soldier which escaped from a destroyed government genetics lab with a super-smart golden retriever which the "hero" calls "furface." groan trust me, in the novel, this story rocked. i'll get to that later. anyway, the hero is none other that dreamy boy-child corey haim. oh, i'm not kidding. our hero runs around, crackly voice and all, trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the "evil government" which birthed him and made him genetically ultra-smart. the monkey-creature, retardedly referred to as an "oxcom" (god help us) is also a genetic-stew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future. michael ironside (total recall, starship troopersalways plays a badass) is also in this film, and no, i couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea. he plays a government agent with the nso hunting the dog and creature. oh yeah, here's some spoilerama: he's also a creation from the government, and the same lab, and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing peopleand all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey-soldier. instead of a rockin' kick-ass, creepy horror film, we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick. the dog's intelligence is discovered all-too-conveniently, and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. breakdown!!change from book to film:--lead character (travis) turned from man to boy-child.--man's love interest in book (nora), is now his motherand all her depth and character growth is completely gone.--lem johnson, black man, is now white mr. ironside. this matters as the character's strength was built on his heritage in the book.--relationship between two authority figures completely ignored, lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend.--one principle character in the book is now totally absent, the "immortal" that hunted the heroes--maybe this is supposed to be ironside, but then why is he someone else?--dog never receives deserving name of "einstein" in the movie.--no part of the book took place in a high schoolat least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot.--takes place over a matter of days, rather months like the bookunrealistic pacing.--corey haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book--and they never met in the book.--character of lem johnson is no longer cool-headed; instead, he's a total asshole that bullies his way through people.--hero travis was part of delta force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead, his dad, who is never seen in the film, was part of that group.--perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent.--subplots involving soviets and the mob completely gutted out of the story.--these are just the most obnoxious changes, and the one's i could remember off hand (and a day later).the good:--eventually, after 90-odd minutes of pain and mental anguish, the movie ended.didn't hurt it, didn't help it:--michael ironsideusually, i like him.--the dog is still fairly likable.--wacky "totally 80's" title screen.the bad:--okay, the writing for one is extremely awful.--the direction is so half-assed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it.--the acting is crappy and weak, especially from corey haim.--loose, weak, watered down story.--the monster looks just pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. its head is gigantically over-sized, the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds. instead of a lean, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we have some jackass in a puke-ugly monkey suit forced upon us.--absolutely no character development.--even the violence and gore are done poorly, for f*ck sakes, this is supposed to be a horror film!! usually violence is at least done well!the ugly:--the idea that dean koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f*cking piece of sh*t brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me. there are movies worse than this (headache-inducing as that idea may seem), but so far, only "alien vs predator," at least to me, is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. memorable scene: watching the end credits start.acting: 3/10 story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is just terrible) atmosphere: 5/10 cinematography: 4/10 character development: 1/10 special effects/make-up: 4/10 nudity/sexuality: 0/10 violence/gore: 4/10 music: 5/10 direction: 3/10cheesiness: 7/10 crappiness: 9/10overall: 3/10i would recommend that no one watch this movie ever, except for a few extreme die-hard horror fansand only if you haven't read the novel. instead, i would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy/check/borrow the book.www.residenthazard.com

so many bad reviewers, it made me wonder, what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director??? did you all expected a super-hit flawless movie?? no way, you already can see, raj kumar kohli loves multi-starrer movies... all of his earlier works where multi-starrers, but no one was flawless. take the first jaani dushman for instance, so many flaws, but still good fun. anyways sticking to the movie, the movie jaani dushman is a hindi fantasy film about a snake, who can take any form (armaan (munish) kohli) which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover (manisha koirala) on the people who caused it. its quite good, with a great star-cast. but i think it could have been much much better. for instance, take the script, can't say its flawless. for example take the ages:do 40-48 yrs old still study in university??there are many many more, i won't list more, but there are dozen more. a solid 5.5 is good for this one.**.75

no words can describe how awful this film is. its like the director literally took a s*** in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public.the acting in this movie is horrendous, the plot is so dumb, and the deaths of each character is laughably bad. some stupid scenes include akshay kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), akshay kumar carrying a bazooka around the town, rajat bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton, rajat bedi and siddharth double penetrating monisha korella (how did they think this was straight?). also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. the scene that supports this statement is when kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses. the shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint.the best parts in this movie are with sunny deol. this man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared. in one scene, he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it. chuck norris' round-house has nothing on that! he is even so powerful, that he can fly from london to india in a matter of 10 minutes! overall, this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe. if you were to watch it, watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout (btw this movie is supposed to be serious)

oh if any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this moviethis film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in?the handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes infrontokay reasons to laugh at the film: 1) akshay, suneil, aditya panscholi, sharad kapoor, arshad warsi as college students 2)akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and sfxthere are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late? also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only?but afterall they have to make a 2 hrs + film so hence you have a tortorius moviethe movie is painful to watch the film was directed by rajkumar kohli who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like jaani dushman(1979) and nagin rajkumar kohli wants to help his son's non existent career right from virodhi(1992),aulad ke dushman (1993) and qahar(1996) all flops he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed, sadly nothing could help his son's careerthe film has several comical scenes like the death scenes, how the actors after being bashed by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climaxdirection by rajkumar kohli is bad music is badthat brings us to the cast akshay kumar - ordinary stuff, he has nothing much to do rather then stunts suneil shetty- awful sonu nigam- the worst debutante award goes to him, he gives cartoon acting a new meaning aftab- terrible arshad warsi- nothing to do sharad kapoor- bad aditya panscholi- irritates sunny deol- is comical in the scene when he comes to save sonu lol manisha koirala- ordinary rambha- akshay's pair kiran kumar, raza murad are as usual raj babbar- hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful which brings us to munish kohli this guy has a huge physique, he is even more stronger and taller then akshay kumar sadly he comes across as poor man's akshay his voice is awful, his expressions are painful the only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face rajat bedi is awful

friday the 13th meets the matrix. as with all of these stupid horror movies, everyone knows who has been killed and who will be killed next, but do nothing to prevent anything, all with the added cgi action effects from the matrix. hasn't the world seen enough matrix reproductions?

i am ashamed to admit in public that i even held the cover of this movie once! this is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it! the 'makers' of this movie have called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands.based on the mythical indian shape-shifting powerful cobras and rebirth, the story takes us for a painful ride. college going 40+ actors (now really?) are the target of their former friend manisha koirala (who was in her former life a cobra, but is now a ghost!) and her pathetic, eternal, powerful boyfriend cobra/killing machine boyfriend munish kohli (who thankfully hasn't been seen since). now do you need to know more?i vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie! give it a pass if you are sane. if not... then you'll probably enjoy it.

if you have seen this movie, then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made. bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies. who would of known that they will copy terminator 2. the difference between both film industries are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends 100 thousands (average). thats the problem with this film, if you want to make a t2 style movie, then do it properly. the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl (in the previous birth) dead by 2 guys, but the blame goes to 10 people. she suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death. not to mention, the reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers. he can transform into anything, he can fly, disappear, fire power, wind power, you name it, he has it. he even gets bazookered and survives the t1000 style. you are probably wondering how he survives. its best not to ask, and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. its best just to forget this film even came out. i think its a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline.

hi, this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. the day when i watched this movie, i was having high fever. but still i watched the movie with lots of patience. and after watching the movie, i felt like repenting. because, i wasted 3 hrs for this stupid movie. i could have taken rest rather then watching this movie. and i was really surprised that how come actors like sunny deol, akshay kumar aftab etc acted in this movie.i don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a film then why do they remain as directors? why can't they sit at home and spent their time at home? i request to all directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences, either by mail or by media, newspapers, radios etc... to send them a nice story if they don't find any good story for to make a film . i request again to all directors please don't make such films.

an insane assault on viewers senses. this is a mish-mash of assorted hindi and english movies - poorly done. the name carries over from a 70s' multi star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts of. the story is taken from the 70s' sunil dutt/reena roy starrer - "nagin" and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) from the matrix, terminator 2 and mission impossible ii.set in a college environment (sunil shetty, akshaye kumar, manisha - college kids!!!???!!), manisha koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros. as it turns out manisha is a cobra (nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming (ichadhari nag) - munish kohli, is out looking for her in this life. manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder.so begins the mad killing spree, where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. the effects are extremely cheap, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce.carry over from nagin includes raj babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more "religiously correct" multi-religion locket (the original nagin only had an "om") . sunny deol plays manisha's love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful munish kohli.music and songs are below average.avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills.

ok, i would give this a 1, but i'm gonna give it a two because i laughed while watching this film...first of all, i can make a much better movie than this one...in a week...the special effects made this film look like a joke. one shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously. the acting and direction was also horrible. the screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all. this has to be the worst indian film ever. the songs were also bad. the acting was bad and artificial. need i say more. don't watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is. that's why i watched it. i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get. trust me, i watched one of the worst films in history if not the worst film.

this movie made me laugh so much. it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. so unbelievable and the worst plot ever. the acting as well was bad. i don't how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie. the script must have been somewhat of a joke. the visual effects in this movie was excrutiatingly painful to watch. i believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot.the plot has numerous attempts at copying major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably. i laughed my head off seeing this movie. a total disaster in indian cinema history!

this movie beats everything out there. well, depends on what you are looking for... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. this movie is in a complete league of its own.. i don't think any movie could possibly come close to it. i am not sure what the director intended to make it as.. a thriller or a comedy. if he did think he was making a thriller, then he has by a stroke of luck, created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time. you have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's hindi movies, with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human).its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side, planning to laugh at the movie! i am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10.. on the basis of flipping a coin, i have decided to give it a 1!

i usually give sequels the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them. but thisis very poor. the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again. the exact same. only they wanted younger kids to be able see it (this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one 'f*ck' is beyond me).they didn't even bother to change jackie mason's character from dangerfield's. let me explain, in caddyshack rodney dangerfield played a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club. in this movie jackie mason plays a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club. a big effort they made to change the content of the script huh? no, i don't think so. a very unfunny dan aykroyd shamefully copies bill murray's character. he even goes after the gopher (now more like a gremlin) in much the same fashion as murray did. there is not a laugh to be had. a sample of the 'comedy' in this film: jackie mason is getting ready for a hot date with dyan cannon. he is in the bathroom is his robe. he moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom whenthe door handle breaks off. wow!?! that's the best they can do. eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we get!?! i could have pulled a better script out of my ass.see it only if you're a die-hard fan of the original. it's the only way you'll find any kind of laughs in it. everyone else steer clear.

this film should never have been made! it stinks, it's awful, it's no good, it's bad, it's terrible. starting to see a pattern here? jackie mason is certainly no rodney dangerfield. gone were ted knight and bill murray, who, along with dangerfield, were essential to the first film. it seems that the three of them (the stars) all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one. the one who didn't have the good sense to bow out of this was chevy chase, who stuck around but was extraneous to both films in my opinion. this film is quite simply not funny. nor does it have any other endearing qualities. this thing relies heavily on anti-semitism to work and it works to it's detriment. i hated this thing. a waste of everybody's time.

jack frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie. the original, was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. and the snowman went around murdering people, and avoiding blow dryers like the plague. this, however, was a far cry from the quality of the original. it seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason, after an hour into this film, i still hadn't seen the snowman. some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character. disappointing to no belief, even for a fan of bad cinema.

-may contain spoilers-clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. i just can't see it any other way. what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.anyhow, where to begin. the bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than george w. bush's college career. i don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts' were getting killed. also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. "how do we know it's him?" like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! a great camp film, but a very bad film overall.

this movie sucks. did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms. there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else. this movie blows hard, painful to sit through too. stay far away.

yes, in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make. it has its funny moments, but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me. you can not come up with a good story, your effects are going to really be bad, hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie. the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort. it also had better effects too, this one is just a step or two ahead of "hobgoblins" as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets. still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. actually, i am just kidding, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.

ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept).i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists, but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..i mean seriously, why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).the "snow anvil" murder scene takes the cake. ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. jack frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. one sequence has jack freezing pool water, encasing a swimming model under the sheet, result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.oh, there's also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from the christmas story("cowatonga dude!").i gotta hand it to the cast, though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. christopher allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as sam, to face his old nemesis, as does eileen seeley, as his wife. the attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me, at least) fell flat, but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze, and, even worse, he now can reproduce..through indigestion, jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans, but i personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it, i suppose, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. the weapon against them..bananas! it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film, both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed, and i guess in their being "being linked" by the icicle, jack inherited sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both "merged" in a sense.phew, such a film as this defies simple explanation. it's a film with effects and plot so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.

having already seen the original "jack frost", i never thought that "jack frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. boy was i wrong! then again, a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. i believe this is the first a-pix sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more a-pix sequels.it's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. they are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which i have to say looks very cheesy. the computer animation surprised me, as the first "jack frost" had no such effects.i'd strongly recommend that you see the original "jack frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).now only if there was "uncle sam 2"...

the poet carne disappears (didn´t he disappeared with prévert?) and is followed by the judge carne. the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesn´t understand and he doesn´t want to. it´s a long way from the wonderful "les enfants du paradis"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this episode had potential. the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. and when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.first of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. "it's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;" "this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago;" "the door opened by itself, without me touching it;" etc.). given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? maybe she could investigate in the day time. or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. or maybe she could turn on the lights!!! also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. just unplug the phone! the phone company doesn't need to be involved. walk up to the phone and unplug it. case closed.finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical. if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony. brave little toaster anyone?

although i could sum this pathetic episode of night gallery in two words, those two words being "horse manure," i am obligated to write a minimum of ten lines. this is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of rod serling, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. the premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless orb to be sure, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. i suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. i can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes first aired on that date. all in all, a waste of film, actors and air time.

this "space snippet" was kind of dumb. i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending, but imho it was just a huge letdown. joseph campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one; their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though. how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me. the other comment on here is not correct, the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously! the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice.

okay, so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct mm2 and mm3, i thought, heck, i got to check out monster man and see what its like, maybe i can get a part in it, but when i popped it into my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad i mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny, not to mention how looooong the director spent on the pointless desert road trip, i cam to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot. the story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual bs you see on the blockbuster/hollywood video shelf put out by lions gate these days, but they surely messed this one up. why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie. myabe the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to find filler to make the usual 84 minutes???? all in all, and i'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street, i will give it at least 1 star for trying, and the gore/kill scenes weren't that bad, again, they tried. too bad, lions gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea, but failed. i don't recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene. crap!

what an absolute joke of a movie. the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre. three good films in their own right and you would think, using their blueprint, mm couldn't go far wrong. well that's what i thought, and i was very, very mistaken! we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding. they pick up a girl (no she doesn't get her clothes off), then they get chased by a leatherface rip-off in a monster truck, whom they aptly name f**kface (aka monster man).the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle, but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it's potential.so mm decides he's got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit, they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitch-hiker sarah (though they both wear underwear!). then they are caught by mm, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm, but fail, hence the set-up for the sequel. apart from a minor 'twist', that's it.if you can get past the first 2 minutes  where adam's friend harley pops up from hiding in the back of adam's car to try to scare him, with no explanation as to how harley even got there, how long ago or how adam even failed to realise  without thinking you hate it already, then you may just enjoy this film.monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately off-putting. this is the kind of movie that you'll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of 20 horror movies that you've never heard of.what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students, and that's exactly what mm is (though imdb states this particular director was born in 1961).the acting throughout this film is atrocious. the script, which the writer obviously considered to be funny, is irritating and childish. you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting. in fact, the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised, full of those boring, un-entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved. imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation, sure, points are funny  to you, but mostly it's trash. that's what the script for mm is like.don't watch it for the gore either  it's fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there (bad taste, evil dead et al) jeepers creepers 1 & 2, even with their cheesiness and plot holes, are far superior to this film. compare the intro of jeepers creepers to the intro of monster man and you'll see what i mean.

now don't get me wrong i love bad movies... no i adore bad movies, troll 2.... ouch painful, manos the hands of fate... just watch torgo go, guru the mad monk.. is that traffic noise in the medieval background? ok so that's clear, but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better, but didn't make it. why not? well it would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we've seen worse, there weren't too many holes and heh i know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that needn't kill a film. the effects aren't bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is ok, the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong? well i'd love to blame it on the 'chris moyles' look-a-like harley... so i will! comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem. i loathed this guy from the moment he stuck his head up (literally), the continual bating of the overly meek adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose belief that the mildest of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door... and i thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of. why are bad movies fun? well you have great fun poking holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howlers etc. this film doesn't make the coveted category of 'worst movies' because its just bad due to being annoying nuff said. don't bother, go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it... i promise! (fade to chants of torgo torgo torgo)

wow, where do i begin? after suffering through this wretched $1.00 rental (thanks a lot, family video) i just had to make a few comments. i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film, but hopefully you will know who i am talking about.a monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two college-aged buddies to their doom. they encounter a hot girl wearing slutty clothes. i mean, this just sounds fantastic in theory. i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video store.acting: the hot girl, played by aimee whatever, is visibly laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared. the other two major actors in the film, the fat prankster and the vanilla straight-guy are both terrible. the fat guy thinks he's jack black. he's not. the other actor, our hero, over-emotes and misses all his cues and comes across as some generic character you might see in a made-for-nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90's. look: i don't expect great performances in movies like these, but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying. you can be an incompetent actor but still be agreeable (i.e. john wayne). at least that aimee gal is attractive.script: holy ****, who thought this dialogue was funny? i wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class, much less pitch it as a film script. unfathomably bad. more on this later.production: ok, this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds. production quality is amazingly high. the look of the film is very good. apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photography.ok, here are my biggest gripes: 1) the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hour.2) the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat. he is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition but he does not notice a 300lb jack black impersonator in the back? come on.4) characters never change their clothes. there are two hotel scenes. presumably, showers are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place, none of the characters bothers to change their clothes.5) comedy. lighthearted, slapstick comedy does not mix with horror. period. you can't have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them verbally jousting one another with some dopey light/comedy music playing. this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie. movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened yet never completely eliminated with humor. monster man doesn't get it.i'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was. oh well.

heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and frightning, but it's neither. obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience. scares and comedy seldomly result in good films, the same goes for monster man.not really funny, nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other level.aproaching 39 years of age i've seen my share of horror movies. i have seen good ones and terrible ones, but the crop of films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre it bores me to watch 'em. the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really annoys me. let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70's, 80's and 90's but they were regarded as such then as well. today they're regarded as "good entertainment". - bollocks!

last night, i am sitting in my tv room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the tv tray & i decide to put the movie "monster man" into my trusty vcr. expecting a fun-filled, gory, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. what do i get instead? one of the most silly, stupid, unfrightening & predictable films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. and what's even worse, all during the(& i use this next phrase loosely) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes on! i'll make this summary short & sweet: mix "dude where's my car" (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a very watered down "hitcher", add a redneck version of the antagonist from "i madman" as the primary villain & finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo & you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is. it's also utterly predictable throughout. the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a "horror film" is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (even though the "hero" is one major annoying geek & the other is a jack black clone) are kind of funny (just mediocre funny i.e..like most of snl skits). other than that, "monster man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (this one i'll be handing out at halloween time-just hope after the person views it i don't get my house egged or worse)

i would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production - that persion is a genius of sorts. this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast. i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on, but nothing really was. it was not scary. the dialog was poorly written. the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode.at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time. that's a couple hours that i will never get back.i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening. take a nap or hit the gym instead. or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel.

i completely disagree with the previous reviewer: this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot. (unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot) in fact, the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a.) two of the actors are decent b.)the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and c.)the monster truck is pretty terrifying.other than that, this is a movie with some intermittent, creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness, crudity and vileness. the former best friend character is one of the most annoying i've ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all.a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character...

fans of horror comedy will like this one. others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off. it's sort of a buddy film, with over-the-top violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters, and a lot of craziness.it looks to have been made on a budget of about $100, by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. there's a lead who's a frustrated nerd, and his loudmouth prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second. there's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the film. whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver appear, it's a great scene. there's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars. the nerd's friend never shuts his yap, and gets them in one mess after another. their arguing got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film make up for it.sight gags poking fun at several "psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody" films are everywhere. take your pick which one is riffed the most: hills have eyes, saw, and jeepers creepers were some that i recognized.it's enjoyable insanity, if you're in the right frame of mind. sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun; it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together.

some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour, but when a film comes along that isn't as original as the "classics" but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po-faced, wanna-be critics completely slag it off. this film made me laugh aloud several times, this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows. the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film. you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them, everyone has friends like both of these guys. another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's awesome, intimidating and really well shot. taking inspiration (completely stealing) from loads of films, the most obvious being duel, jeepers creepers and probably in reference to the jack black alike co-star orange county. but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here. but so what, it's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it's a 10! obviously it's not getting a 10, i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99% of the people on imdb. there is no-way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ain't getting a 10 either. it's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares. you really can't get anymore simple than that.

this dvd is barely 30 minutes long, and has dull interviews that reveal that the average slipknotian has an iq of around 30. but these aspects are the least problematic here.the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100,000 units of their crap. (the only reason i say "one of the" instead of "the" is because system of a down are even worse.) much like ed gein's girlfriends, this band's music is pieced together from age-old metal clichés, which are to be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. in fact, their image is kind of fun; their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment.their music, however, consists of nothing of quality - whatsoever: just a bunch of gimmicky, heard-them-a-million-times-before played-solely-at-the-guitar-neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlights, no nothing. but if the riffs are truly bad, then the vocals are even worse: slipknot's singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting "evil" growl - the kind 90% of all metal bands today have - but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing! still, what could one expect? rule no.39 of the "nu metal" handbook says quite clearly: "you will alternately growl and sing. ignore the fact that the two styles don't mix well, because most of your fans are so tone-deaf they will love you even if you **** into the microphone." slipknot are at their absolute worst when their "singer" starts belching out "melodies".but back to their image. it's stolen, copied, ripped off, nicked, borrowed, taken without asking from none other than mr.bungle. you've never heard of them? of course you haven't. you only listen to nu-metal, and mr.bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. they too wore masks - grotesque, horror ones, similar to those of slipknot, i might add - in the late 80s and early 90s. this band, whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more, never hit it big because their music wasn't directed toward the average music fans (to put it mildly).so, basically slipknot aren't even original in the image department. they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit-faced fans, which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music.speaking of mike patton, it's interesting that a number of nu-metal bands often site his singing as a major influence. predictably - and thankfully - patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub-genres ever...having said that, enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye... and then polish those slipknot posters, because in a few years no-one will be taking care of them, the poor dears.having seen corey in the documentary "get thrashed", i finally understand why he wears a mask: he is a blue-eyed baby-faced ginger, looking like dave mustaine's younger brother! not exactly scary.for more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/1please punish me hard, very hard, by clicking "no" below. that'll teach me...

here's why this movie fell very short of its potential(i don't read much, so i don't care what the novel was like). 1. i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan. it was stiff, and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. they screwed with the story. maybe that's how the book goes, but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were "me tarzan, you jane". jane is the first human tarzan encounters. i did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. tarzan is primarily a love story. i'm sorry, but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture. that qualifies her for a supporting role at best. supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other, not enough screen time, sorry. not only was andie mcdowell's vioce over pathetic(most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked) the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0. i never believed they loved each other, which made the belgian dudes closing voice over, quite frankly, silly. when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you will, a feeling he's never felt before. jane brings out the humanity in him, and he brings out the untamed side of her. its this chemistry that compells the story of tarzan. not that lord greystoke's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him. even a good face lift couldn't help this movie. it needs massive internal reconstruction. oh, and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place. final judgement, 4 out of 10. sorry tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio.

a female friend invited me to see this in the theaters.after half an hour we walked out, and went into the next multiplex (yeah, we broke the rules) in time to catch the beginning of against all odds.i remember too many apes dancing around saying, "oog, oog." very little about the characters or introduction to the story captured either one of us or was even memorable. it just dragged to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend).the production values were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. it seemed like ralph richardson and andie mcdowell were going to be wasted in such a poorly written film.perhaps if you make into the second hour, there is something worth seeing. i do not have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.

i am very interested in animal children and i have read many edger rice burroughs novels -- but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested, nor could i stomach all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. i only managed to sit through the africa part and john's first few days in scotland. let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! the actors in ape suits looked like extra large chimps, rather than great apes (there is a difference). they did not move with the grace that a wild animal would. (for comparison, see some of the better planet of the apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion). the apes eat large haunches of meat -- not a common ape practice as far as i know. i am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes. the great white hunters of the expedition that finds john clayton are charicaturish entirely. the parents of clayton were shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast -- give me a break! let's talk about 'slow'. even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. far from it. it tries to be a character study -- unfortunately the downright silly part predominates! i did not read burroughs' tarzan books, but many of his other series -- they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose! this film just isn't there.

this is my opinion of this movie, expressed in its dialogs.to be more serious, i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either. first, i was simply indifferent & couldn't get my mind into the apes world. even though the make-up are very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. may the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter.the second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of then newcomers (macdowell & lambert), but i felt alienated: all the story is located in a big british mansion: no matter how luxurious is it, it was like a prison for me.at last, it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs' story of tarzan ? i don't know, having never read the book (or seen the disney): .in conclusion, i don't have any good moments to remember, so one viewing would be enough for me. i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "overture" at the beginning... what's the meaning? only the director knows it.

i've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book.. i don't think any of them have actually read it. edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters. we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view. i've never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgar's vision. maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story. so, if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals, maybe a good cry, see the movie. i hope john carter of mars get's more respect than tarzan has. we miss ya, edgar!

the incomparable paul naschy, horror film icon of spain, lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film. what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story. all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride.paul naschy plays a cold-hearted hit-man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters (one of which is his flame who is carrying his child) to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman. when the deed is done, the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts. his girlfriend, whose brother paul killed, vows revenge and chases paul through the forest, shooting him up and leaving him for dead. however, paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate.at the estate, the two daughters, silvia aguilar and azucena hernandez, fight for paul in his weakened state, with the busty silvia aguilar determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim azucena. but things get hairy for mr. naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate grounds. couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides.story: $$ (the story goes a number of ways and doesn't fully satisfy. the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia, whose character seems assertive and volatile, simply lets azucena win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight. personally, i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman)violence: $$$ (you get gunplay, a blown-up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive. gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick).acting: $$$ (paul naschy, as always, is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds. starring with him again are the luscious silvia aguilar and the beautiful azucena hernandez, who teamed with mr. naschy in the little gem "the craving." both girls do a fine job).nudity: $$$ (you get very brief glimpses of both aguilar and hernandez but they are strategically placed, keeping the naught bits covered. full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses: the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and azucena).

this is just a long advertisement for the movie "the death tunnel". although it is an interesting history of the waverly hills sanatorium, the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation. more "ghost orbs" which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and the "ectoplasmic mist" is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash. i couldn't see any "shadow people" until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image. no scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe, so be sure to make plans to visit the sanatorium on your next vacation in louisville, kentucky.

being a science fiction fan from my early childhood (long time since) i always hated implausible plots. it's a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. i always suspected them of thinking: "children are to dumb to realise, so we don't have to strive". the writer of "science fiction (2002)" is no exception. the story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents, because they think that the parents are aliens. as intriguing the idea sounded to me, as much was i bored by its realisation. it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark, stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere. the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish"? and then - bang - they did not even try. so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, go and watch "klatretøsen (2002)" instead.

first of three aztec mummies film is the only one that to the best of my knowledge was never completely dubbed into english. the film was chopped up and used in pieces by people like jerry warren in other films (he combined it with another mexican horror comedy with lon chaney to make face of the screaming werewolf. and it showed up in attack of the mayan mummy and elsewhere.) the longest of the three films, a good chunk of this film makes up the two later films which use this as a basis of flash backs. the plot of this film has a scientist conducting a past life regression experiment which causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden chambers in an aztec pyramid. the group, as well as a sinister figure known as the bat, hope to use the information to discover hidden treasure. instead they discover a living mummy who has other plans. long and long winded this film has way too little action to sustain its 80 minute running time (worse the mummy doesn't even show up until an hour has passed). probably the least of the three films, its easy to see why this film was cut apart, it's the only way to fashion a non-sleep inducing film. watching the film late last night i found myself fighting to stay awake. it was a tough haul and i found that i ended up scanning to the point where the mummy showed up. given the choice i'd take a pass and watch the second two films.

after watching the first movie in bci's new aztec mummy collection, it's difficult to believe how excited i was about the set and how upset i was when the release date was pushed back. i've watched a lot of mexican horror in recent months. some great  the curse of the crying woman. some entertaining despite obvious flaws  night of the bloody apes. and some cheesy  pick any santo movie. one thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called "dull". well, that's not the case with the aztec mummy. it's been awhile since i last watched something so sleep inducing. i wasn't hoping for or expecting a great movie, but at least entertain me! the aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity. i guess that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material. padding extraordinaire! for example, for anyone who has seen the movie, what purpose does the bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes? i can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more entertaining than this one.

this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered. the cinematography was dull, with long tedious shots (like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made little sense to the content on screen. the editing was terrible, scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher. the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien. the acting was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).

i managed to see this at what i think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the dublin international film festival. while i was attending another film two nights later at the same theater, i saw brendan gleeson, paul mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another promotional screening of studs.i have to say that i was bitterly disappointed with the film, i was by no means expecting a masterpiece, but what was presented to me, i believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into. before i continue, two things, i accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here this is simply not the case. secondly, i know that it was based on a play (which i haven't read but have been informed that it isn't a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film.my main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it simply doesn't work, the down and out team are trying to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. having read so far, you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a "charlatan" of a manager and his hopeless team. it certainly does not achieve this, i'm not even sure if it was aiming to. any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. overall, i found the script lacking in many respects.i do think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well made. but aside from those points, which should be expected from any irish film at this stage, i left the theater feeling very disappointed.my judgment may seem harsh but i do think there is some hope for a strong national irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument. as studs has become a recommended dublin cineworld film (i was part of the audience at that screening), most people would seem to be disagreeing with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film.

this is a poor film. it certainly belongs in the how not to make a feature film category. story, direction, acting and style are all flat as a pancake. story consists of five  yes five  football matches spread out over the film's duration, each one more boringly filmed than the last, as a dysfunctional amateur football team go from strength to strength. that's it, that's the plot. it's hard to know who this film is aimed at. it's too banal for football fans and there's nothing in it for teens nor grown-ups. there's nothing in it for women either, there isn't even a single female character. it's dreariness wears you down as the team play game after game after game after game after game. the story, such as it is, dialogue and mannerisms seem lifted from a bygone ireland, with all the actors spouting cod theatrical dublin accents. it doesn't have to be seen to be believed. avoid at all costs. can someone give me back my 90 minutes. high point the credits at the end, low point too numerous to mention. brendan gleeson is in this film.

making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn't do anything for the audience. the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor.what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed.i don't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show.the deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written. what i would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. the film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social/political commentary.my overall impression was that the film was rushed, thematically under developed and visually not up to standard. on a positive note the performances and music were very good.

having watched the first scene, i realized the acting was so bad that it couldn't possibly pick up later. superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five year-old tries to make it sound as if he knows what he's talking about. the second-to-second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did, was the kind you expect from a below-average grade school student. the overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. the few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent, was limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. a ten year-old might like it. but it would take a five year-old to accept the lack of realism; how does advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if with a magic wand, pick out one out of 100s of voices through a ventilation system (thereby ripping off superman), and repair a home computer by just sensing whats wrong instead of looking for faults? actually, that scene is a neat example: the fault was that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum ribbons) on the cpu was broken, the way it would look if a exhaust pipe on a v8 engine is ripped off by an explosion. this is something that can't happen, and if it did, it wouldn't prevent the computer from working. there is no electrical current passing through this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, his arms worked by autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient) put a push-pin into the rip, a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting.and so it goes all the way. like when he escaped an interrogation room in the nsa headquarters by lighting a lighter below a fire sensor, resulting in open doors throughout the building. naturally, nsa didn't predict this sharp witted approach to escaping, nor did they put any guards outside his room (or anywhere else) to guard a living, walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology. so he walked out and got a cab. examples like this one are not only numerous, there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense. also, the so-called great effects were terrible. he threw a basketball back to a kid in the park, and the kid was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. no acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized trolley. i'm sure if i paused and looked for the cables that kept the posture of this kid the way only cables can, they probably didn't know how to or bother to erase them completely. if someone is thrown that far into a tree, they would at least say ouch (or rather be hospitalized with broken bones), but the kid was just just confused and amazed.moronic. that's the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production. i'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist, someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve. i feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it, and the time it took to write this. although it felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved. the only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily, would be imprisonment or lobotomy.

(caution: several spoilers)someday, somewhere, there's going to be a post-apocalyptic movie made that doesn't stink. unfortunately, the postman is not that movie, though i have to give it credit for trying.kevin costner plays somebody credited only as "the postman." he's not actually a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western america devastated by some unspecified catastrophe. he trades with isolated villages by performing shakespeare. suddenly a pack of bandits called the holnists, the self-declared warlords of the west, descend upon a village that costner's visiting, and their evil leader gen. bethlehem (will patton) drafts costner. after much misery and numerous efforts to break costner's spirit, he escapes, thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three-minute flashback.we now finally get to the major premise: the escaped costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman. a number of the village people led by young ford (larenz tate) want to get in on this postman act, which does not sit well with bethlehem and his bandits, and costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the holnists.the idea of the postmen versus the bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. the holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another; the holnists can destroy any one village, but could not stand against all their victims united. to unite, the villages must communicate with one another, and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the holnists out of business. so it really makes a lot of sense that bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers. unfortunately, bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him, but instead your old standby cliche, the one-on-one brawl between him and costner. nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard "hi, aunt debbie" stuff played for maximum sentimental value.the postman is one of the most predictable movies, shot for shot, that i have ever seen. now, i don't purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out what's going to happen next. but here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; i just knew what was going to happen next whether or not i wanted to know. after a lion is prominently showcased eating people, a holnist bandit seeking the escaped costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are then "shocked" when the lion eats him. a bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings out some famous last words right before being shot, to my immense lack of surprise. a covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there: costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie. a man tells bethlehem that no sir, you can't just take my wife; bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through, though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting.but it is rank, cloying sentimentality that really undoes the postman. olivia williams, playing costner's lover abby, is worst served. she pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere. she tries so hard, it's heart-breaking. but nobody could ever have made the lines "i have a gift for you, postman . . . you give out hope like it's candy in your pocket" sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are. another example is the scene where a mounted costner thunders past a little boy, ignoring his proffered letter, only to turn around, stare at him for what seems like five minutes, and then thunder back to pick up the letter. why didn't costner just pick it up the first time? no real reason; it's just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kid's hopes and then restoring them.schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the postman is revealed. i sat thinking, "please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid. surely that is too saccharine, too obvious for even this movie." then, alas, the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away, and i held my head in my hands and thought, "somebody shoot me." it felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throat.gen. bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal. your standard-issue post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest, toughest s.o.b. in the valley. bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside, who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others. although some menace is thereby sacrificed, bethlehem is credible in a way most villains aren't. unfortunately, will patton overacts. and although we are told early on that bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, bethlehem's actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous.the acting is otherwise pretty good. costner has done better, but his razzie was an overreaction. as mentioned, olivia williams is very impressive. larenz tate as ford does a sincere and credible job. james newton howard's score is competent, though short of the epic standards the movie was going for. but it's not enough to save this film.rating: *1/2 out of ****.

its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by walt disney in the 1940s, but its true. here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge. one can either completely rewrite the story a la tim burton which is a discussion for another time, or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail. the latter is what is attempted here, and if i may say, pitifully so. unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in crane or wanderlust in good old bram bones ruin the story's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers. by the time the tale's famous climax approached, i had completely lost interest. its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background.

the depiction of ichabod crane's character was so terrifically unlikable, my wife and i were hoping that the horseman (or some other character) would not only cut off crane's head, but do it slowly and painfully.i mean, this brent carver guy played it over the top---like he was on broadway. and he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him whatsoever.i could go on with specific critiques of how this movie failed, but i prefer to not devote the energy.just skip it and go for the johnny depp version. either that, or rent the haunted pumpkin of sleepy hollow (animated). it is quite good--entertaining for kids and adults.better yet, read washington irving's original story.

crap! i accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the swimming upstream that was released in 2003. i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it. shame on whoever gave this junk an award. i thoroughly loathed this film-in fact i didn't see it through to the end. after an hour i could no longer stand it. i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such ba-ad acting. painful. i rate it 1 star out of 10. an amateur could make a much, much greater movie.

i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the 2003 swimming upstream with geoffry rush. this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen. the script was forced, the acting was subpar and the editing annoying. it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying. but i always give a movie a chance, so i suffered until the very end. apparently there was a memo out about this movie, because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater. why didn't somebody send me this memo?!?! that is why i'm posting, as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this. i just hope that you actually got to this page, and didn't get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong "swimming upstream." p.s. sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this. i know that you worked hard to make this. i know what goes into making a movie... keep trying!

let me preface this by going on record, i am a huge george clooney fan, and i love john krasinski in 'the office'. well, i was and i did.this was the world's worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to rip it off. the stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over.every funny scene was in the previews. all three of them. there was no real story, no character development, and the script was just plain bad. i've had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable.the title should have been superduper bad. this movie is a lock for a razzie. it should get a whole slough of razzies. i want my money back.

this is defiantly a dvd rental movie. i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me. don't expect "oh brother where art thou" in any way shape or form. funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the argon. seems like they were trying to copy some of clooney's funny facial expressions from "oh brother where art thou" but you could kind of tell they were trying for that. john krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout. renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story. overall it's a movie worth watching at home.

ok where do i start? i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is. sure if you just love beverly hillbillies and green acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie. me, personally, i really like george's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great & funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen. it was a cute movie but would i pay $12.00 to see it? h&ll no !!!! now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money. george, buddy, i love you but please don't do any more comedies? this script is lacking a lot, great concept but just didn't do it.

the `plot' of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through, but i reckon that isn't always top priority in horror. two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years. now, he escaped and started a killing spree, focusing on militaries that are homed nearby. `we only did we thought was best for him' they keep on repeating and  strangely  all the army officers love these women and don't doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of their men died. i don't know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful  or tedious! in a way, this film reminded me about `arsenic and old lace'. in that black-comedy classic, two half-insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well, yet they do the killing there. the old ladies in `the beast in the cellar' are by no means less crazy, though. the `horror' in this early 70's film is very amateurish and cheap, but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension. too many `old-ladies' talk about the good ol' days, though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title. flora robson, who may be recognized by classic film buffs, plays one of the sisters. she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film, the sea hawk.

i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid. i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years. i spent a couple of years trying to find it online...didn't remember the title, only the storyline. after searching and searching, i came across a vhs that was being sold on e-bay. i was excited and when it finally arrived, i jammed it into the vcr and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. needless to say, i was slightly disappointed. this wasn't the movie i remember watching as a kid. it was boring at times and i found beryl reid's incessant whinning extremely annoying. both performances by reid and flora robson were good overall but the movie wasn't scary. i think any movie is worth viewing to form you're own opinion but sometimes, well......

crash is supposed to be a film about racism in los angeles. but in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. who the hell is going to believe that? there are unrealistic situations, one after the other. on the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between asians, iranians, latinos, blacks, and whites. but the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. iranians are poor, just like the asians. and latinos, as always, are portrait as housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. jesus!!! don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a black tv director, who was the only fresh character for me. this movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from hollywood these days. always with stereotype characters. no realism whatsoever. nothing to identify with. it's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show latinos, koreans, iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.

given this film's incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional. it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. a series of robert altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. a series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until i'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. paul haggis has tackled the subject of race in la, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. let's hope it is the latter, because brokeback mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.

i must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films i have seen in my entire life! annoying factor number one: never seeing the "son's" face (for the entire movie). and the infinitely more annoying factor: that incessantly ringing phone..nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...you get my point. the old man was being harassed but the viewer was too! at first the film was interesting to me but it deteriorated very quickly. the film may possibly have been good as a short but was definitely not enough to maintain anything approaching feature film length. i guess what i am trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally put in an appearance during the last two scenes of the movie) is secondary to this old mans being harassed. who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man spouting obscenities at someone prank calling him?? if you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy...check this one out!

i recently watched this film on the sundance channel and it kept me interested from the start. however, it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end, i felt somewhat cheated. in a nutshell, noble willingham (of walker, texas ranger fame) plays a boat salesman who starts getting harassed by telephone from a man claiming to be his son. according to the mysterious caller, willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects the son and he (the son) is enjoying reminding him of it. i won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this movie a great deal. one, the movie has more foul language than goodfellas, scarface, casino, and glengarry glen ross combined. 99% of it is spewed from willingham himself. it didn't take long to wear me out with constant four-letter words. two, i simply could not believe that anyone would answer the telephone that many times, especially when one knows that a crank caller is on the other end of the line. no matter where willingham is in the movie whether it be at work, home, a diner, etc., the phone rings and he always answers it spewing venom at the "son", and then hanging up only to answer it again when the caller calls back in about ten seconds! how many of us would do that? now i realize that we probably do not have a movie if he doesn't keep answering, but i just could not suspend disbelief on that particular matter. three, and this is the most minor of the criticisms, why is the director so opposed to showing us the "corndog man" (a.k.a. the caller/son)? most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone. i could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place, but since they didn't it's just one more to tack on. i do give the movie credit for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it. do see it, if only one time. however, if you're like me, you'll be saying "triple k marine!" in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it.

no way this overly simplistic script, with basically one character, should be interpreted as feature entertainment. in reality it has about enough material for an eighteen minute short, and even that would seriously tax your attention span. zero characters beyond noble willingham are developed. the never ending closeups of lips and telephones are sleep inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. in fact this whole sad thing shouldn't have even been put on film. a tape recording would have been more than sufficient to put you to sleep. definitely not recommended. - merk

this film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling, which tries to hide behind an "artfilm" facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover up for it's lack of psychological depth of the characters & internal conflicts. everything in this movie is pretentious, from the thank you's to bela tarr at the beginning, to the photography, the acting, music, the story & editing. when suddenly, without reason, you are forced to watch close ups of "charismatic" looking hungarian country people in their boats, while the soundtrack is trying to persuade you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment, although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic, thats one thing. putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing, for which i absolutely have no comprehension. this movie is trying really hard to enter a certain genre of artistic (east european drama kind of) films but lacks the subtlety, observational skills and "soul" that other directors have.

hungary can't make any good movies. fact. this is a great example of that.first of all the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. it's seriously weak. even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that. sure, it's about a taboo, but that's about it. there are endless possibilities, which could have been really great, if used, but they nearly skipped everything. i think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulness.the acting is just plain shitty. there aren't many lines, so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimicking abilities, but no. in fact, 86% of the time, they suck. and that's when they don't say anything. if they say even a single word, you'll start tilting your head, saying: "that's damn unrealistic". but than again, this is partly the fault of the writing. there's also no emotion in most of the dialogs.the editing is sometimes ok, but most of the time illogical and just worsens the whole picture. it could have given an emotional push, yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each other.someone please explain it to me, why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. calling this an "art" isn't gonna make it better. sorry mundruczo, but you failed. live with it. even tho you probably won't care about my or any other guys opinion scarifying your "child".

i recently watched this movie because i'm a big kinski fan. but, oh my god. don't get me wrong. i love this guy. but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work! but fortunately he isn't the only one to blame. first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit. that's all. all the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream. but maybe that's the fun of it all. if you know the kinski-biography it's obvious that kinski didn't care about those movies at all. especially all his italo-western roles. he just took the money and that was it. again, this whole movie is totally weird. only for hardcore-fans of the genre.

"cleo's second husband" is an amateurish attempt at psychodrama with more to fault than to praise. the plot is hacked, the story monotonous, the acting poor, the execution second rate, etc. not worth the time unless maybe your a relative of one of the actors. pu! (d)

usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a monotonically descending pattern. this bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive. the acting, save for the male antagonist, was awful. the plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene, which is probably good as performance art, but it was wasted in this movie. not sure why this movie was made.

this movie is so mild! i tried not to expect anything greater from this film, but still it was a big disappointment. the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential. this could have been so much better. the characters are really simple, no depth at all. it's a shame that previously talented performers tiina lymi and petteri summanen didn't make the already poor characters any better. the director just don't get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr*p.and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie. that's hideous!!!why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation?it's too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it. oh no!

hitting the ground running, the film begins with three murders in a row. no plot, no characters, no motivation; the second murder happens off screen, and that victim's severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death! this is a high point. but the lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with strength; soon they're covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot. by now this betacam production's horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe, with the monumental (and rather endearing) plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction. shlub cop investigates, meat cleaver guy slaughters, repeat, climaxing early with a memorable severed-finger-in-the-salad gag. only, how the hell did the fingers get in the salad? and wasn't the blood cult's purpose to collect the appendages they severed? when the gore stops making sense, you know you're in trouble. and without spoiling the big, nonsensical twist ending, just take my word for it: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode-tube-smashing impulse. the basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life.

what can i say? this was hands-down the worst movie i have ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are admittedly horrible). the acting was amateurish, the sets were boring, and the camerawork was shoddy and sophomoric. this whole movie seemed like a college final project. i had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a teenager to make it seem somewhat good. the most disturbing factor of the "film" is that it's not even film at all-- it 's shot on video. that was extremely distracting. on top of all that, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot line is so basic it makes my eyes water. not to mention they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. if there were such a thing as zero stars, this movie would get it.the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is.

let me see...i've seen every film lou ferrigno has made. i've seen batman & robin...twice. i've memorized the dances in breakin' 2: electric boogaloo...i've watched unfinished blade runner rip-off student films...yet this film is the most painful thing i've ever seen.this was the first movie for the "straight to video market." so you can thank blood cult for all of those mysterious michael dudikoff films at your local blockbuster. you should know that this isn't even high quality video. this is consumer grade. this is you father's video camera he never uses. this is what you have to look at for 90 minutes.i won't bore you with plot details since i'm getting sleepy just thinking about it, but i will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. i only watch this movie when i am angry at myself. so i recommend this film if you are suicidal, or if you are up for a mighty challenge.if you happen to rent this film (god have mercy) you will know what you are in for from the first 10 minutes. this is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro. you know the drill. there's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies. yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. this is the most boring intro i've ever seen. i honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars, grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy, and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. it bored me to tears. i cried like a baby.another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its actors. yes, i've seen bad acting. trust me. i've seen 4th grade productions of oliver twist with more realistic dialog. the lead actor makes me ill. the "supporting" actress is a train-wreck of a human.i will not even comment on the boyfriend. true horror.so, rent this movie if you can find it. you'll never be more depressed that you spent 3 dollars on anything else.

**spoilers** the killer in the movie doesn't wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied arm as he makes his getaway. we then get this official looking prologue, as if were watching a true story, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid-western collage.grandfatherly looking, and hearing impaired, sheriff ron delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students, all women, continues his run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn. there's at least two times when delboys says that they'll never be another murder as long as he's on the case and within minutes another murder happens.finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff's daughter, the collage librarian, tina finds this reference book about withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witches cult that originated in the early 1700 just after the salem witch trials. this cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local townspeople back in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part. when the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual.you never get a handle to what's exactly happening in the movie "blood cult" not just because it's totally disjointed story but it's ever more outrageous and grad-school level acing especially by charles ellis playing the butterfingered sheriff ron delboys. getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into. the bumbling sheriff delboys ends up with his head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive, after being dismembered. the only reason he wasn't is because he seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug.there's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the witches cult that's responsible for the sorority murders. the movie doesn't bother to explain at all if the dream, that the drugged sheriff delboys had, was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie!getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house, while munching down a bag full of mcdonald cheeseburgers, sheriff delboys finally comes face to face with the killer. shefiff delboys find out to his shock and amazement that not only does he know who he, or she, is but he's also willing to let the killer escape!the very first straight to video motion picture and it shows. not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission, at least with the video you can tape over it thank god, to see this disaster but no movie-house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the outraged patrons, in a justifiable show of righteous indignation, tear the place apart!

"nuts in may" may be one of the worst films i have ever seen. if ed wood was still alive this would be the type of movie he would be doing.to say this movie is bad would be the understatement of the century. but how bad is it really? well, here are two levels of bad i go by; "it's so bad it's good" or "it's so bad it's god awful". this film falls into the latter section. what little unintentional humor it has does not make up for the slow, hard to understand, boring majority of the film.summary: spoilers**two middle-aged anglos take a trip to the countryside for some r&r and camping, there they met ray soon-to-be jim (i'll explain later), who's tent is next to our main couple. throughout most of the movie the two leads go sight seeing on the beach, at a rock quarry and other exciting locations. in between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism,fossil collecting, the duty of a proper citizen and proper diet, all thing i want to see in a comedy. they bore anyone who will listen to them. the dialogue is not only bad, but the pacing in some scenes is so slow i sometimes felt like dosing off. scenes would go on forever and just when it begins to build up and something is about to happen the scene ends. half way through the movie i thought to myself, "nothing is going to happen in this thing, it is truly a movie about nothing".the characters are annoying and constantly repeat things. at one part i felt the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience. the scene i am referring to is the "sing along" scene. in it our two boresome brits play some of there music for us, actually it was the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over. the idea was to get ray to sing along with them, but ray knew, as well as us, that they are the worst songwriters known to man. this scene was beyond tedious, by the fifth time the song was played i started to question the existance of a merciful god.words can not describe the awfulness of this film. the first thing that strikes you is the indecipherable british accents that most of the cast has. remember the thick scottish accents in trainspotting? times that by 10.towards the end our tree hugging, incoherent, couple get into a fight with some of ray's friends that have complete disrespect for the rules of camping. our hero becomes so incensed that a climatic battle ensues between our hero and the head hellraiser. to settle their dispute the two men engage in a stick fight. that's right a stick fight! now this is where the unintensional humor starts. i laughed so hard at the ineptitude of it all that i thought, "this may make up for the other 80 minutes." after this histerical battle our hero runs behind some bushes to cry his eyes out and the other man calls ray over by calling him jim for some unknown reason.a stick fight, a crying nature loving 40 year old and a character name change 3/4 into the movie, ed wood would be proud.though, i was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes which to sum up ends with a long take of a pig. why? who the hell knows. at one moment we see a pig grazing and the next the credits start to role over the screen. one of the worst endings to a one of the worst films of all time.

i don't know who financed it, or why, but this "want to be" vampire flick is really awful. it tries to be hip, and appeal to the young mtv-generation audience, but it is just downright laughable. the acting is horrible, and the directing is horrendous. i heard the budget was $600,000. i want to know where all the money went?

hi y'all,i bought this on dvd from england. you see, i have one of those multi-region players. i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends. well, surprise to amy-jo johnson, she's barely in the movie. although she is on the cover. it's really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place. perhaps someone has a trust fund.oh... it's about vampires who live at the beach

ok, let's see... a handsome young stranger is new in town, and walks around on the local boardwalk. he meets a pretty girl, meets up with the obnoxious leader of the local hip young vampires club, is dared by them to follow them into this cave, gets into a conflict over the pretty girl, an epic fight ensues...no, it's not lost boys, although you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference, since i think even some of the carnival music is the same. (do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie?) even the ending of this stinkbomb is ripped off from lost boys. the make-up is below par, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and just exactly how many "oh, i had this horrible experience" scenes of teen angst does one movie need? the humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is sadly predictable. yawn.the only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that hopefully every distributor in the country will drive a stake through.

i saw this film at temple university. i cannot imaging that anyone will ever see this film in a theater (projected on film). the acting is similar to saved by the bell (the tv show). the plot is simple and unimaginative. the sound recordist likes the sound of wind and the dp needs a light meter. vampires, vampires, vampires.don't waste your money.

sighthe stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments went terribly wrong, burdening us with a half man-half mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he's upset. lance henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project, but he returns (bringing the whole family with him) when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree. "mind ripper" certainly is a watchable horror movie, but it's very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame cliché you can think off (including the estranged father/rebellious teenage son sub plot...yawn). the characters are like wooden puppets, the dumbest things are being said and done and there's a completely pointless dream-sequence...coming from the monster!!! there's a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert-locations are effectively eerie. lance henriksen is adequate as always, even though this is yet another inferior production he stars, and giovanni ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in. for some reason, this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as "the hills have eyes part 3". is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert? is it because wes craven was once again involved, as a producer this time? or maybe it's because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael berryman in the 1977 original? who knows...who cares? wes craven probably financed this project because his son co-wrote the script and it's always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are. not recommended!

a scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong.the creators become trapped in a remote desert outpost,pursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation.james stockton,the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster,is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark halls.james,together with his son and daughter,soon find themselves trapped inside with the others,trying desperately to survive.and with the outpost sealed from within,there is no way out..."the outpost"/"mind ripper" is highly unoriginal.the sets are pretty claustrophobic and there's a bit of gore.however as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels.there's zero suspense,the script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictable.so-called master wes craven produced this one-i wonder if he is happy with this trash.joe gayton directs without any style.the acting is horrible,only lance henriksen can act at all.ok,i'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed.avoid it like the plague-it's just the same old boring crap again!

this is wes craven at his worst! this is the very worst horror, if you can call it horror, you will ever watch, esp from one of the masters of horror wes craven, poor direction, poor acting, poor set, poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever! the bad guy is totally unconvincing, you couldn't even feel sorry for the guy! the gore, and horror involved in the film is laughable, it's just plain rubbish! the only good points i can think of is, it stars natasha gregson wagner, giovanni ribisi, and lance henriksen, but not even that cast, could stop this from spiralling out of control, and into one of the worst horrors ever. if you still ain't watch it yet, don't bother, you'll only hate it.

think you've seen the worst movie in the world? think again. the person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. the cover makes it look like a good, scary horror suspense thriller. but, no. what we have instead is nightscream. a movie that makes a "sweeeoooowww!!" noise every time a credit flashes across the screen. the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van dien who hardly has a part.i voted a one for this one only because i couldn't vote any lower. if i could vote something like negative five-thousand, trust me, i would have. so, for now, i'm going to give nightscream 1/2* out of 5 just because it ended.

this is horrible even for a tv movie. i can't believe it took three people to write this movie. i am not familiar with the novel on which this film was based, but it has got to be better than this. i'd rather watch a "full house" marathon than this stupid movie. i gave it 2 out of 10 stars only because it was made better by commercials.

nightscream is a tv movie so it's bound to be pretty dire especially as it's a supposed horror film. this young girl is haunted by dreams as she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman one year before. she is amazed when everyone in the town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. the townsfolk are amazed when she keeps entering dream like trances where she reveals accurate details about the murder and murderer because the police got it all wrong apparently. thinking that they are in danger of being found out, the murderers (there are two of them) start to hatch a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth. by this time you will have probably fallen asleep and why do the makers of the film have the 'mist-making' machine on full throttle in the dream sequences.

while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie... though through out the picture the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot) are by the book and unoriginal... and with every one the movie kept getting worse!candace cameron bure, famous for her role as dj tanner on the hit tv show full house, is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something.. trying to avenge the possesers death. i believe she is fine actress.... just not in the thriller range.the filming was trashy, and like i said the plot stale... though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese, i had no idea how much worse this film could get...i highly do not recommend this movie... unless cheep filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for

i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this. this, my friends, is one of the worst tv movies i've ever seen. there is no excitement in this film.the story starts out with drew summers(candice cameron bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. she stays with a couple who coincidentally, had a daughter named laura fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike. thing is, laura was killed over a year ago. her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered, making it look like he had killed her.while settling in this town for a while, drew starts to have visions and nightmares. these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isn't the killer after all. throughout the film, you find out that ray ordwell sr.(denis arndt) is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her.the movie is too long and very boring. the film just drags on and on and on and on. amazingly, i saw another tv movie after this called (cloned) 1997 which was good but i'll review that one later.i give this movie 1 star out of 10. avoid this tv movie. it is not worth your time. this is the worst tv movie of 1997!

matthew aldrich. this is a name worthy of remembrance. this is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time. cliché. predictable. an insult to the public's intelligence.is he the sole beneficiary of blame? of course not. renny harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie. sam jackson and ed harris actually read it (or not) and chose to star in it. culpability abounds.this is the denise richards of film scripts. there aren't enough razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is.in all fairness, samuel jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it's presented is highly creative, but, at the end of the day, it's all just trimmings. pretty trimmings.package it any way you want- garbage writing is still garbage writing.

tom cutler (jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner-upper. in his latest job, he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported. uh oh, this can't be good. you hear about cleaners all the time, but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up. this one is different in that tom cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene. hey, someone has to do it. you know the police won't. the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up. this is almost a good thriller, but a side plot involving tom's daughter (palmer) makes this story somewhat awkward. i guess they had to fill in some time. oh, they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot, but it was still a reach and awkward. see?this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension, suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy. the music didn't help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey. you know, journey music. get it? ha!the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller. violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: no

i normally don't try and second guess a crime thriller, but cleaner was just entirely too predictable. samuel l. jackson playing the character tom cutler, along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film, however, that was about it. without even thinking i knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes i had already figured out who the killer was. rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout, i watched to its completion. what a disappointment, i was right from the beginning.the casting of characters was a good, as well as the acting from jackson and harris...except for eva mendes. from the starting gate she didn't play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon. maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself. her role as ann norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her. this would've made the build-up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic. nevertheless, cleaner is watchable, not memorable. i've seen episodes of csi that were more thrilling then this.

request you to not watch this movie... it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end... predictable,not entertaining at all,wasted movie... save your time and watch better thrillers.... the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie... but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start... no great suspense.. no great direction... nothing phenomenal with the acting... shy away from this... low rating... nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is...really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it...

it starts really interesting - the story develops around the main character, who runs a "cleaning business", specialized in cleaning up crime scenes. as a former cop, he runs into some strange situation, when one job does suddenly "offically vanish". furthermore, he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption. his "columbo feeling" is justified, the deeper he gets into the background of the story. the good actors (jackson, ed harris, eva mendes) play in an suspenseful story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to here 7 of 10 stars). spoiler:::: suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot-out, involving the 14-year old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development... why not having cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship? or having the daughter discovering some facts? or ... many possible much better story finishes are imaginable... a truly wasted ending!

not even original in the plot. ho hum. there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of hollywood movies. i don't really "get" samuel jackson's acting most of the time in his other films, but he was rather good in this film. he rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an "in your face anger." i liked eva mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy, she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress. luis guzman was actually really good also, except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film. how can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second? is there no original thought left in hollywood?

a plot that is dumb beyond belief. however, that said, it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare. and that is as it should be. it isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma.hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna kerns. she proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be seized and dug into. and she does so with gusto. good for her.ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy, but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script.and to grant show as well. a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps (ryan's hope, melrose place). he is always versatile and underrated. his primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good looks. he is a sturdy, well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do.the rest of the cast is basically window dressing.the direction is adequate and the script, as i alluded to, is fairly idiotic.watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing. it's fun.

i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews. please, a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both aspire to love and being basketball legends. grow apart, but watch each others progress. guess what! both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman. our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies, and guess what is picked up by lakers. dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period. so for 5 years they go their own way. she returns from spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on-going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. he wins he marries she wins he loves her. well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl. the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties. sorry 2 is my high score. my partner she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read mills and boon

one of the most boring movies i've ever had to sit through, it's completely formulaic. just a cookie cutout of a movie, you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre, as this movie adds nothing new. the dialogue is never funny, interesting, or intelligent. the acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything looks to have been done by an amatuer filmmaker. nothing fresh, memorable, or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is long gives it an easy thumbs down. sorry, fans.overall grade: f

the acting in this film was of the old school: corny and stiff. irene dunne is luminous, and comes off the best even though she has some very unnatural lines to say. still, her ability to convey emotion comes through.old movie buffs will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film through observation of cinematic technique of the 1930s. otherwise, it is not really that worthwhile.

the ealing comedies constitute their own specific sub-genre in the history of film. they were wry, droll reflections on british life in the late forties and early fifties. they are always amusing but i feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies. they are breezy and good-humoured, rather than laugh-out-loud funny. however, the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak (epecially kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers).i have an affection for all of them, but the lavender hill mob is probably the one i have most difficulty with. compared to the others, it seems somewhat perfunctory. to me, it is an outline sketch for a movie, but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras.everything about it is a bit undercooked. for example, nobody is given any real context or background. henry is simply a dutiful drudge, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised, while albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living. this establishes a motive for their crime, but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan.other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story. the elderly resident in henry's guest house could (with her love of detective stories) have been made an unwitting thorn in his side, but is merely used as background 'colour'. similarly, the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along.as a result, the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices, which i find both frustrating and faintly irritating. the not-very-ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems, despite albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan (by sidney tafler's clayton). the gold is then smuggled to france without mishap. everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a minor hitch, lamely based on the french pronunciation of the letter 'r', which results in six of the gold eiffel towers being accidentally sold to some english schoolgirls.this leads to a series of frantic chases as henry and albert seek to retrieve them. these scenes are well executed, but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly factitious accidents. it is as if god is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time. this kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth.when they finally track the last eiffel tower to a police academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of john gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) all shreds of plot logic are abandoned. the final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began.the movie doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of albert (stanley holloway), lackery (sid james) and shorty (alfie bass).this genial little caper has the professionalism of the ealing team behind it, so it is far from being a bad movie. i suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than i do (and why shouldn't they?), but i cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made, if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story.by the standards established by ealing, lavender hill mob is a missed opportunity.ps: one curious footnote is that audrey hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on, but archie duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. i guess she just had a better agent.

i watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and i won't make that mistake again.the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don't see what it is. flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. when the ending is finally reveled, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. the only connection these people have is that they have all had a "bad day"--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.if this was supposed to be a "crash" clone, it's a complete failure.

a nicely evoked 1930s setting provides much interest for a viewer in the early 21st century; unfortunately, "london belongs to me" has little else to recommend it besides lashings of quaint english charm. all of the problems rest with the deeply unfocused story. the main plot concerns the actions of young lad richard attenborough, the problems he gets into and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from society's laws. or something. the main issue here is that attenborough's character brings everything upon himself and, quite frankly, is guilty of almost every accusation brought against him, so it's baffling why the film (and all the characters) have so much sympathy for him. he's treated as a victim of circumstance when he really, really isn't; and what's more he isn't shown to have very much remorse for his actions, only caring about getting away with things he didn't mean to do. alastair sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and you wonder what he's doing there (though sim is, as always, superb). you know there's a problem with the structure when the main plot impacts constantly against the subplot but not vice-versa. and, following a sedate pace and a careful build up, the plot completely falls apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfying and unexplained conclusion which doesn't even show us if attenborough's character has developed at all from the previous proceedings. the film doesn't end, it just stops.the acting, direction and the general feel of the film can all be commended but unfortunately the story and structure of the piece jars constantly. a last point of trivia: alec guinness based his performance in the vastly superior film "the ladykillers" on alastair sim's performance in this film, right down to both the characters having almost identical first scenes.

this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through. 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more. seriously, do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo-arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured. boring, although the acting is fine; the kid is just plain irritating. some scenes are a little strange with very weird close-ups. i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white, but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably. there was just nothing to watch, and although its a sad tale, supposedly, its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters.

i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shill.the acting of the female lead is actually quite good, but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it. this is the very definition of dullness.so far, this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes. that must mean the director, director's girlfriend, producer, actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10.for the rest of you, who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story, avoid this.this man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10.fda note: while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep, no medicinal value is implied or offered.

this film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide. she is tormented by her son who refused to speak after that.child grief is rarely explored on film, so it is refreshing to see a film like addison's wall. however, due to the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. apart from a few key emotional moments, everything in the film is very plain. the abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable. addison's wall could have been much better, such as exploration of the contents of the wall, a more intensive care program to help addison to go through his trauma. instead, the film feels very unfinished and non engaging.

this movie tries to say something profound; i'm just not sure what it was. too much is left unresolved in the end for me to figure out the main point. a couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor. i don't think the wall was very well developed i never got what was actually going on there. when the mother finally unveils it i just couldn't make any connection to the boy's silence. what was the point of the boy not talking? was he just delusional or did he acquire some sort of power. what was the scene with the burnt girl all about? another power the boy has or what? i don't understand how that developed any character or moved the plot. i got the bully bit but what happened to the dog? did the dog come back or did mom get rid of fido for good somehow? there were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use. like the radio talk show in the background discussing the iraq war. i think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and insecurity the mother and addison were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained. i didn't buy the link very much. i also found the teacher getting on addison about not saying "here" for roll call a bit much. the mom seeing the doctor was pointless, how did it serve the plot? was that to show how desperate the mother was getting, or was it something about the medicine that i didn't get? was that the dad coming back in the last scene, or just some guy? so did writing on the wall work? what happened to the dog?

conclusion: very, but very, very boring, yet i watched till the end, hoping for some upside-down effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. the old black&white game didn't helped at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but this was not the case. the script, the plot, etc were linear, had no substance, nothing in-going. when you deal with psychological, you deal with analysis, therefore with details, that unity-diversity formula....there was no essence, no detail. just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie-makers...well, this is not the one.

a depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or drapes in her windows. he steels assorted things from her, peeps at her, does prank calls, and plays assorted unpleasant tricks on her. oddly, he keeps none of this a secret from her. at first, she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her. then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel fevered activities.there are some illogical items to note. one is that the guy peeps into the night through a pane of glass from the more brightly lit side. in real life such a thing would not happen. the more brightly lit side of a pane of glass acts as a mirror. he would be able to see exactly nothing. also, everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room.one other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a milkman, and his one and only customer each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on. easy work, if you can get it.i saw a short film about love at a public showing. by the end, there was not a single open eye in the house. a short film about love is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles. not only are there very few words spoken in the film, but much of the movie is silent. a certain rest in peace.

this is an excruciatingly boring, slow-moving movie. we can feel some sympathy for the socially- and sexually-inexperienced and awkward tomek, but the motivations of magda are pretty hard to see, and the ending, at least for me, was inscrutable. maybe it's about how we all need love, but i'd get more out of a good busby berkeley.i'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines, so i'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and institutions. i wonder if it's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government.finally, watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in magda's stove.

surprisingly kieslowski's this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes cliché script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes. there is an isolated young boy. he lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building. it seems! that he wants her. he is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex. however, he likes that woman, when the woman comes to his house with a man, tomek gets pain. then, we understand that kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. he does not do something else, because may be he knows that it is his salvation. one day, he stops that woman, suddenly, he seems a shy boy, but proves that he is not, so he explains her almost everything. she lectures and refuses him. everything is so realistic like the other kieslowski films, no problem. the problems start when tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman, at the beginnings the woman refuses, but after a short time, she starts to change her mind. this u-turn makes the movie cliché firstly. the personality of tomek is weird? or a result of a poor observation? i disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and i will try to tell why. when he goes to her house, magda treats him very friendly. she asks what do you want from me? to kiss me? to make love with me? to go out with me? at this point, i remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. see? returning to the scene, tomek rejects all the proposals. why? because he is shy? i don't think so, but his communication is blunt, ok. after the leg scene at home, some events make the movie misses its aim. i think that the aim of the movie is (should have been according to the story) to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men. i mean that at this point, what does the movie say? it is blurred and disappointing. it is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex. then, what? and the suicide attempt scene support this weakness. so that he touches her legs, he wants to kill himself! by the way, as i mentioned before, some say magda is a femme fatale. totally not. she endeavors in order to make tomek happy. does she avoid having contact with him? no. does she insult him? no. does she amuse him? no. and does she deceive him? no. she has some troubles with her (ex) lover, so she is not o.k. however, she does not take revenge for it from tomek. she is not an angel, but not a femme fatale also.

would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier? are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? does it even matter? you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting. well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. if this isn't about homosexuality, murder, dismemberment, psychopaths, insanity, deviant psychology, then it is about acting - acting helped along with lots of dialog, so, enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is.for english speakers, "twelve angry men" might be a better choice. there's a bit more interaction, and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog. you don't have to wonder if you're missing something.i would recommend andy warhol's "empire" to those who like this film.

the fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame, but back in the 1940s, that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to black audiences due to segregation. so, while mgm, warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films, tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had. and from seeing this movie, it's obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film, even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking. some of the actors weren't particularly good (especially the french guy), the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly but the film also had some good music--of varying styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues. this is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized black performers.now as for the plot, it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a kitschy way. i loved seeing tim moore ("kingfish" from the amos 'n andy tv show) in drag, as he made the absolute ugliest woman in cinema history (this includes the bride of frankenstein and many others)--this is probably due to the fact that when not in drag, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. if the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman, i doubt this movie would have worked as well. seeing this ugly and rubber-faced man with a cheesy wig still being ardently sought after by three suitors was pretty funny.this isn't a great film but from a historical point of view, it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what america was like for blacks in this era. a very interesting and funny time capsule.

there's potential in there with "tell no-one". a curious and intriguing plot, and a french take on a very american story. but for me, the opportunities were not exercised here.although i liked aspects of this film, there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten.firstly, it's a silly, clichéd murder mystery. a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac. being french doesn't eliminate this problem - it's just silly and in french at the same time. it's full of implausible coincidences.secondly, the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically. this french doctor hanging out on "the streets" of a french city with his new "homies" and their blingin' suvs... and then there's the car chases...but thirdly and mostly, it's just too darn long. to me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes, and over two hours takes some serious justification. this once didn't have it.

it's unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases. (i.e. anger at the gay characters, thinking french thrillers are bad, etc.) i will admit that i'm unfamiliar with the novel, but as a film, after about 45 minutes, i was rolling my eyes. hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length.(2 hours that felt like 3) don't get me wrong, i can sit through hour and a half silent films, 3 hour epics, i don't have a short attention span, nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film. here goes, my grocery list of complaints. first off, the ending. yes, it had a scooby-doo-esquire, character explains everything at the end. now i actually think for this movie, this was necessary.. the film had so many plot-twists, emotional revelations, new facts surfacing and being discovered.. one reviewer said it well: "..yes, it is a very logical story, but without the very essential back story (their childhood stories, the relationship amongst the 3 parents, the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man), it just doesn't feel right. i felt cheated " i won't throw in too many spoilers here, i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary, but according to the reviews on here, there's a lot of people who seem to really love this, so i don't want to give anything away. i personally, can't stand soap operas. the complexity, and twists and turns, for me, snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver. by the end, i seriously didn't care! there weren't any gaping plot holes necessarily; this seems like it could make a great book, in writing it is perfectly logical, but if i'm supposed to believe this is reality, something doesn't sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted. too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot, increase the emotion, and develop the mystery. the acting i had no complaints about, the directing, eh, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, severely lacking. sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller, but i couldn't get into it. i gave this a 3 simply because i don't want to seem completely unfair, and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement. *major spoiler* and i have to mention it.. but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldn't fit in another twist.. "your father didn't die in a hunting accident".. i almost died.. when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story?!! are you serious!! like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasn't enough!!? does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed?! sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler, but that just bothered me as much as i've ever been bothered in any film.

hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade b performance and he delivers a rather good one. outside of madsen and hopper the acting is horrid; you've seen better at your local high school. the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of b-movies. the scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes i've ever seen (it doesn't even come close to fitting in the movie). the script was probably a great 10-page outline, but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies madsen left behind. i do have to say hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the hummer had me laughing out loud, but i don't think that was the intent. yes there is a little style, and hopper can always draw my interest. however the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this.

if you are like me and observed the original "benji" phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is, and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974.my judgment is not entirely objective as i tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. on the other hand i have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of "petticoat junction". never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time.benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of mckinney, texas. if this sounds boring you would be advised to give "benji" a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a "benji" fan (if there are still any out there). unlike "my dog skip", "monkey business" or "because of winn-dixie" the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. "big valley's" peter breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame. if one of your children (of any age) appears to be finding "benji" entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

you know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal - in this case, a little dog - is the best actor on the screen! the acting in this film is so bad, so amateurish, by dog got embarrassed watching this. he ("rusty," our golden retreiver) could have done a better job than the people in here.by now this is almost a trite story: kid finds animal, pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the "pet" winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family. sound familiar? i remember this movie being a big hit, but never got around to seeing it until the mid '90s on vhs. i was shocked how bad it was. why so much fuss over a film? was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd? possibly. there wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories. who could resist this cute little dog? not me. but the movie i can resist: it's a grade b storyline with horrible acting. recommended only for small-dog animal lovers and i mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day-and-age.

beloved tale of hero "benji" ("higgins" the dog) who is many different things to many different people. in his busy day "benji" grabs breakfast at the house of two young children, has a chat with an officer of the law, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an aging café owner to start on the day's special. helper to some, amusement to others, he is companion to all.trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home. from here on we know only "benji" can save the day.plot is routine from writer/producer/director joe camp, and he does tend to over do the slow motion effects. audiences though will find it hard to resist the lovable little pooch, and kids of all ages are sure to adore him. cast were never going to be anything but background to "benji".not what you'd call inspired, but fun family fare. academy award nominee for "benji's" theme, "i feel love".saturday, july 13, 1996 - video

a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect. dull, banal film bored the hell out of me. more an idea then a film. i was half way into this 77 minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was. it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character. certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center, there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough. its not. and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it, especially if one has seen the other, better films of a similar ilk (rendition with reese witherspoon for example)

for those of you who have a few kind words for this film, i suspect you didn't see it when it was released as "parts: the clonus horror." it was a dreadfully boring movie. it missed the mark in at least three ways. it wasn't good enough to be scary; it wasn't bad enough to be funny (although mst3k took care of that); and, even in 1979, the plot was unoriginal.earlier contenders are "the resurrection of zachary wheeler" (1971). it's the same idea (clones as spare parts). the movie is entertaining, and it had a fine cast. another is "sleeper" (1973). yes, the woody allen movie. remember the flattened nose? and "clones" (1973). the last two plots aren't as similar to clonus as the first one, but they predate clonus.they are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea, although often, the word "clone" isn't used.

how many english 101 student's versions of 1984 must america endure? "gosh, this is a great book, but kind of a downer. i know, i'll write one just like it where everything works out okay. i'll also replace orwell's old, used up political insights from the thirties with my own insightful, informed opinions form the 1970s. think, think, political insight... evil politicians, i'm a genius! and there will be clones that they make of themselves for some diabolical reason... i'll work on that. it'll work." no it won't, bob sullivan, writer of this story. this really is all you're fault. you could have stopped them early and said, "guys, with our budget and acting abilities, i was thinking more romantic comedy, or we could move away form taking ourselves so seriously and make a campy spoof this tired, familiar genre of movies." did you do that though bob? no you didn't, and you've had 28 years to think about it. i don't mean to be so spiteful. i'm sorry i yelled at you bob. you've obviously had to live with this mistake a lot longer then i have. some blame really should go to ron smith, who helped you adapt the screenplay. he could have stopped you at any time. you were young and naive, and he took advantage of you. now he wrights the plots for video games and you, bob, well who knows what you do. i'm sorry if that sounds harsh bob, but that's the way it is. you were sold upriver by the hollywood hotshots. as if ron wasn't enough, michael bay also saw your movie, and without even asking for rights or anything, added some explosions to your concept and turned it into "the island." that i think is the most disgusting part of all, that with a little eye candy, your script could of easily been good enough for a major hollywood production, which i'd of hated just as much as this movie and not felt sorry for you at all. i'm sorry things worked this way for you bob. ron and michael walked all over you, leaving you a withered shell of a man, who's height of movie writing greatness will be a joke on mystery science theater 3000. don't focus on that though bob, because karma works in mysterious ways, and one day, they'll pay for what they did to poor little bob sullivan.

this film was sourced from my friends mum who worked in a charity shop. she gave it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes. the film itself is a bit rubbish. there are a few notable bits to laugh at like the bit when his girlfriend gets her head drilled into, but in general the film is bland. interstingly when i saw the trailer for "the island" i couldn't help noticing the similarities. clonus may have been the inspiration for that film? all in all don't bother watching this film as it is dull and boring. we enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after it. another sign this film is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case don't actually appear in the film? weird

slooooooow, tepid, poorly produced 70's schlocker made moore cowvincing because of today's headlines; nonetheless, this film is worthy stink-fodder because of uncowvincing acting, absent direction, and silly 70's clothing(sadly, the moocow remembers when adidas clothing was all the rage...). this has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci-fi moovies accowmplished, namely "westworld" and "logan's run". while the premise interesting(rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with richard(tim donnelly), a clone who is at once both boring and irritating. hollow acting by donnelly doesn't help, but fits right in with the rest of the cast. even such b-illuminaries as dick sargent("bewitched" tv series, "ghost with 1,000,000 eyes), keenan wynn("dr. strangelove", "the dark", "laserblast"), and peter graves("beginning of the end", "killers from space", "it conquered the world")provide only the moost tepid performances. produced, directed, and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it's no surprise that "clonus" fails to horrify anyone in the least, much less keep anyone's attention! truth be told, there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock-fans would love - wanna see some realllly bad, funny 70's films, put on anything by greydon clark. "clonus" is no bonus; the moocow says even the mst3k-version is a yawner, so proceed at yer own risk! :=8p

parts: the clonus horror is not that bad of a movie. i have the mst3k version of it on tape and it is hilarious, but its still not the worst film the have ever done. i would go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they have made fun of. the concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. it could have become a classic if it was not so boring and had a bit more excitement. sadly it was botched in production and ended up on mst3k.

the only reason i'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of mystery science theater 3000. the horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act. the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows. no chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him. dick sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil...he was more annoying then anything. peter graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful, his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent. in 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called the island...i personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie. if you want to laugh at this movie get the mst3k episode its really funny...full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable

i'll say this first...the film would've been a 70s sci-fi classic if it had been executed a lot better.that said, let's examine the plot...it starts with peter graves (or is that clarence oveur?) running for president, then cuts to a goofy college campus-like environ full of authoritarians in goofy trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who all act like they're perpetually age 8. it then shows one guy apparently going to america, having a party, then taken to a medical lab where he is drugged, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for steamers packs...okay, actually he's being put on ice so the doctors can extract the organs they need.it then cuts to another dopey man thinking the place he's living in is a bit strange after a beer can (of all plot devices possible) he finds in a river makes him look suspicious (damn those beer cans!). he and some equally stupid love interest of his feel they need to get to the bottom of it all, so he makes her stay behind as he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the way about cloning...and how he's a part of it.he escapes his controllers after being shot some and an old reporter guy helps him find his 'father'--the man he was cloned from. it just so happens he's a clone of the brother of peter graves. after debate about what to do with him and his evidence, he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend (who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid, harmless, and ready to host a talk show according to the sol crew). he is captured and put into cold storage just like his nazi-build retard friend from the beginning of the film.meanwhile, a confrontation at graves' brothers house results in several deaths, including graves'. the reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb. it seems the conspirators have won to some extent...then, peter graves turns out to be able to survive being run through with a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parts, and giving another 'vote for me' speech just as reporters confront him about the cloning thing.definitely mst3k fodder, but on the low end of the spectrum as far as overall badness goes.

parts: the clonus horror is a horror all right. there are of course the bad fashions of the late 70's. there's the really bad acting from dick sargent to peter graves. and then there's the clones themselves. their days mostly consist of running, jumping, cycling, and wrestling with each other. when they're not doing that, they learn about america. not the band america, or the song by neil diamond, but an america where they go on to become part of a greater society. but they're given some strange drug then they have all their bodily fluids drained(general ripper was right!) and they are placed in the freezer and await thanksgiving or christmas when they will be thawed out and roasted at about 450 degrees or so. oops, that's not what happens, but it would've been a lot more interesting than what's shown. mario, of super mario brothers fame, makes a delightful cameo as a doctor who bickers with dick sargent.

when you're used to lana turner in the postman always rings twice, and compare it to this low budget, low talent, low quality film, well, i was just embarrassed for ida lupino's 'singing' (more like talking) and non-piano playing scenes. when the first non-singing scene started and all the people just stared flatly at her, i was positive they were all going to roll their eyes and start leaving or at least talking among themselves (she stinks, c'mon let's get out of here). the actors are flat - emotions are deflated. and ida is a real spoiled bi-otch throughout - just a 100% turnoff. this was like betty boop on conscious sedation meets a gas station attendant in nowhere's ville usa. the story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, her chest was... no never mind. i felt sad for the rest of the actors. perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role, and the men actors had more emotion, then the film could have had a chance. sorry for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world. i wouldn't have minded if it stayed out of this world.

20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. miscast is ida lupino in the leading role! lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room torch singer. handsome cornel wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented celeste holm who's role is little more than a bit part. then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! when we first see him he is a nice o.k. guy who runs a thriving road house. then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - he becomes insanely jealous of his manager (wilde) when the latter tells him that he is about to marry lupino. you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but - 1) he never proposed to her - 2) they never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - 3)without telling anyone (including lupino) he has obtained a marriage license. wow! so how widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with lupino after such a "courtship" is anybody's quess. huh? well, when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say. from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical! his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. he finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy udo sniggers, he laughably goes gunning for poor cornel wilde before biting the dust himself.and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. there's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! added to this - 95% of the film takes place at night.besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette "widmark & lupino at fox". whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else! however this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as robert osborne, eddie muller, rudy belhmer and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. all i can say then it must be me i guess. but "road house" up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained so.fox would do better if they issued dvds of superior and thus far elusive widmark movies like "down to the sea in ships" (1949) and the colourful "red skies of montana" (1952).

an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition. seeing as terrence malick produced this, i expected something haunting and lyrical. instead, we get a typical norwegian co-production ("revolution" with al pacino, anyone?), where - quite possibly - good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. the "me-tarzan-you-jane" english dialogue between the non-english-speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy  one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad-libbed their own, as they almost sound like real people. the story is loaded with implausibility: we are expected to believe that binh can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical command, increases impressively in the malayan refugee camp, without the benefit of night classes). coincidence is rife; i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third: he tracks down his mother in ho chi minh city almost immediately - after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother, who nonchalantly recognises him! mum gives him a gold locket (or something similar of great value) as they part, but this is never referred to again. his relationship with "me dead inside" ling is supposed to provide the obligatory "love interest", but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in "gangs of new york". the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails. indeed, the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable, is the jerky, hand-held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions. (incidentally, a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast, without stopping for fuel or supplies, is certainly an epic journey). the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick's use of magic hour, but i want to know why the coast guard didn't show up. perhaps they were watching the super bowl, or something. of course, binh manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas, with the same navigational flair he displayed in ho chi minh city. i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick. for demonstration of how a story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget, check out michael winterbottom's far superior "in this world".

my wife and i never got into the movie.we thought it was way to sloooowwww and to many subtitles.i understood they needed them for vietnam,but took to long to get out of asia.she wanted it off i said it's going to get better.it never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to america,but i wanted to see him looking and finding his dad.not at the end but forming a relationship.did i mention it was slllloooowwwwww.i love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end.i know they don't make many good movies now days.i think action movies are the only ones to watch.i have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster,maybe 20% are worth seeing.i don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.gary

thursday june 9, 9:15pm egyptian theater saturday june 11, 2:00pm uptown theaterbeing loved and belonging is essential for most children. those born to vietnamese mothers and gi fathers often found neither. the beautiful country is the story of one such child, binh, rejected by his rural village then struggling to find his american father. the film begins with green and wild country but descends into grimy sweaty ugliness and boredom. the considerable talents of tim roth and temuera morrison are wasted in pointless and ill conceived roles aboard the rusting freighter carrying binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be stock shots of stormy seas. new york city offers slave labor and cliché characters. while very uneven from it's start the great curiosity of this film is the final segment. nick nolte is given top billing among the cast. i jokingly suggested he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth. as the journey brings binh to texas and his father the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity. a tenuous cohabitation knits these two men together into a family of father and son. the ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just watched is rewarded by a profound and subtle performance from nolte as they slowly interact. the credits rolled and i was surprised to see the names of badlands executive producer edward pressman and west texas native terrence malick.

"the beautiful country" is a big disappointment. it doesn't come up to my expectation. bihn, a tall muscular guy, is a son of an american gi and a vietnamese woman during vietnam war. we were told that that he was treated "less than dust" in vietnam in the early 90s, so he fleeted to america to seek his american father.sounds like a heart broken material? maybe, but showing in this film. i find myself having a hard time to connect to bihn emotionally, because the film is full of cliché and i simply don't understand or believe him. the writing of this film is a total failure. the plot is full of holes. it grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience. we are not that stupid and it doesn't work that way. let's see what the film is trying to do. so, you don't feel bihn's boat trip (yeah, he was on a boat!) is hard enough, let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little. still not touched? fine! get a little kid to suffer the heat, the hungry, the sickness, the violence with the adults on the boat, hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience. still not touched? you heartless sob, let's... ok, i don't want to give any spoiler of the film, but you get the idea.the film is really long and slow. it never tell us why bihn didn't go to find his mom and dad, until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad. what has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to saigon to look for his mom? and guess what? he has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for, and he will find anybody without a scratch. i really think the department of homeland security should hire those vietnamese who helped bihn. the beautiful country? which one? both vietnam and america seem hell to bihn.

if i guess your "palabra", will you let me go through?- asks william geld, a tim robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh.he is trying to get to a forbidden area. the woman stopping him continues blabbering: -your "palabra" is carrefour.-how did you know?- the lady asks, surprised. he answers, in the name of wisdom: -i was hearing when you weren't talking. :/yes, this defines the movie. this precisely. it doesn't matter if carrefour is "road conjunction" in french, or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages. or if samantha morton has nothing, nothing of spanish (maria gonzalez being her name in the film) with her irish, scotish whatever tone.it's boring and dull. if you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms, you will buy the most bizarre, sickening love relationship ever, set in a future that may well be in seven seconds. i can guess this movie's palabra: it will be "painful".

many times the description "full of sound and fury signifying nothing" is used and is right on target. unfortunately "code 46" lacks both sound and fury. a bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated. tim robbins character (william) is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with maria (samantha morton) seems almost absurd. these folks are so passionless that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with thorazine. there is a "brave new world" sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2-3 stops overexposed. unfortunately this technique gets tedious and rather hard on the eyes. the cutesy mishmash of languages also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence. many futuristic, scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance. this film has neither flash nor substance. its a code 6 all the way.

well, shuck me sideways. i haven't seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal 13 seconds or half caste. someone should take away this guy's sony handycam! this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $20, doesn't necessarily mean you should.i remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book, "rebel without a crew" was that when you set out to make a no budget feature, you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal. rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. robert rodriquez was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico, so the mayor let him shoot all over for free. what you got in el mariachi was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget.i'm sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book, and he took that advice to heart. in this case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year. seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep a cornfield interesting for 90 minutes. not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by northwest. take a hint, fella... cornfields don't make for riveting cinema. it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations, because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes. this movie looks like it cost about $30. (or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield maze).apparently he couldn't even find anyone to act in his movie, so he cast himself. big mistake. here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. so, as far as assets go, it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had. maybe he thought that was enough. in fact, i'm going to go out on a limb and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie, before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to dark harvest, was called simply the maize: the movie. maybe this he's already planning the maize: the musical or even the maize: the mini-series.our jack-of-all-trades (and yes, the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen. think of the character from the dead zone, but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall. psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters, who are at the corn maze with mom, are going to be killed. he rushes to save them. from that point on, the whole movie is spent watching pyschic dad run around in a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder.shot on a $200 handycam. the director cast himself. edited on imovie. improvised story. if that's not enough to keep you away from this a-maize-ingly corny catastrophe, consider this as a final warning... the whole movie takes place in a cornfield, boils and ghouls. here's ghoulie guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. next time you see a cornfield, stop the car. take a flashlight and go run around in there for like 90 minutes.

my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i crapped myself.once you finish watching it, you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror. then, there's a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice hisses, "you will die in seven days." you turn around, and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster.i won't lie: this is the worst movie on the face of the earth. i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18-year-old guys, and these were our reactions: -one person actually began crying and punching himself -one person screamed and passed out -one person stood up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later -one person simply blacked out (this one was me) -one person started babbling incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and touretts' syndrome -one person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutesthe movie really is that bad. there's one part where the retarded cameraman actually trips (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it in. seriously, you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground. there's only one special effect, and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a rubix cube is special: the camera rotates so that the on-screen action (action, n. some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes) does a barrel roll.under no circumstances should it be watched, and the movie itself even warns you of this fact. do you know what the tagline on the back is? "some warnings should not be ignored." i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the producers' part. that's not to say, however, that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store - it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see. rather, buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate.

this is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie, no, make that any movie, i have ever watched. shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap. i never ask for a refund on any movie, but i think this will be a first.the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it.i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping.the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster.

this movie was so bad i don't know where to begin, apparently neither did the filmmakers. it starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching tv. the news tells of a corn maze that's open for halloween. he has a "vision" of god knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this "vision" how you ask? i don't know, and as i said before neither do the filmmakers. they're simply visions of people's feet. how did he get these "visions"? it's never explained, we're just supposed to go along with it. he enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him, one time they actually run into him. what does he do? does he chase after them? no. he stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past. do the girls stop? no. they run off then ask "was that dad?" then someone dressed as demon jumps on the "star" (the dad character) he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted maze. the police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad term to use) they cuff him. they cuff his hands in front of him, so that he can find something to pick the lock with, which he does. first off, anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back, and secondly why does this "average guy" seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs? well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the "star's" wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction. by the way, it's now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down. leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers, why not. besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well. by the way, the "star" who goes by the name of "walker", we figure out it's his last name, a name in which his wife even calls him by. somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging. i say 'somehow' because i couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. he finds a locket, what does it mean? nothing to anyone who watches this, but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime. somebody killed their kids in his "vision" and i guess that's what he's going on, real detective work. and by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze, one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film, which is why he's looking for his girls. every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a weird robotic sound, like a sci-fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical. why do we hear this sound? is it in anyway related to...anything? again, who knows? certainly not the filmmakers. the peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when "walker" yells out "hey you, mr. bad man...i'm gonna get you." another time his wife is attacked by the "bad man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which like i mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen. the "bad man" calls "walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well. "walker" can only reply with "hey. hey!" before dropping his phone and running off. with no one on the other end to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats. if this script wasn't written by a child i'd be surprised. opps it wasn't. it was written, directed, and produced by the same guy. and not only that, he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well, where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield, that waste 90% of the film time. in the end "walker" uses the cuffs to cuff the "bad man", who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that "walker" had picked it with. apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield. but after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids "walker" kills the "bad man", and everything is right with the world again. now in reality this makes "walker" a murderer, he's killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his. he knows this, not because of proof, but because of his visions. he never found a body, nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze. and the locket? he gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls. no proof. so he kills a man without any tangible reason. i can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. it must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company. i would rather watch the blair witch project five times than see this film again. the actors should be ashamed. the director/producer/writer/cameraman should also be ashamed. in fact the entire production company should be ashamed. if there is anyone associated with this film, please reply. what were you thinking?

only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be 'unredeemable' i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws plainly stated by some of the other commentators: the "film" is shot on video (what type of camera i don't know) but the cameraman had it on autofocus(!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus. in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. this alone screams "amateur".i also noticed that out in the 'middle of the cornfield', you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights ... loudly.also what is with that single lighting source that follows (and many times 'leads' the actors) when they walk around. it looks like a newscaster with that 'on camera light' that follows the people around like a spotlight. there was no 'credit' for lighting design/dp and i know why. the 'filmmakers' saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture (note i didn't say "film"). so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the movie. ughhh!!!this is probably the most technically inept production i've ever seen commercially released. i "bought" this title because i like bad cinema. usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it. this is just so bad that it's unwatchable. plan nine from outer space is "citizen kane" in comparison to this title.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen, as well as, the worst that i will probably ever see. i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously, just be forewarned...this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it, its just plain bad bad bad bad bad.this movie is the equivalent to having a "pet rock" as your friend. you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. unfortunately, it never does. at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. lion's gate completely deceives on this bombshell... no...this is a disaster. after watching this film, you would swear george w. bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. its probably how lion's gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe.

anyone can make a movie these days. budget, production value, or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described "director" from "realizing their dream" these days.respect for the craft of film-making, or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.director bill cowell must have thought he struck gold when lion's gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.i personally find lion's gate far, far more in error than cowell in regard to dark harvest 2 being made available to the public. lion's gate's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general's office and lion's gate's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film, film-making, and good sense.as for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.

completely agree with other review.i watched this movie for about 5 minutes. i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand, jaw dropping lower and lower. the quality of the filming is beyond low budget. it doesn't even look like a freaking movie. if i were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary i would expect it.in summary: avoid, avoid avoid. boooo lion's gate!completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that i've saved others from renting or owning it.

besides the comments on the technical merits of the production, or lack thereof, the acting is absolutely horrible. what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it, of course, it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as "dark harvest 2", and after having seen it, i can understand why it was in the bargain bin - they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventory.the majority of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them. i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. in the maze, he runs into the ghost of some children, which are poorly done, and the movie goes horribly south from there.i can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise, they would never have gotten rid of them. absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through, and it wasn't worth the $2 i spent on it.

a guy, with the unlikely name of shy walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. that's the entire plot...with across-the-board bad acting, of course. walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? i get it! hahaha...not funny) and yells "girls? where are you?!?" about 1000 times. for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin, a chipmunk-sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yeah ok...). his daughters scream for most of the movie...even when there is no reason to scream (maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie?). twin girls straight out of 'the shining' show up every now and then. most of the corn maze looks the same so walker's search gets very old very quickly. the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie (even the music is repetitive) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary, and rotating the camera 360 degrees (at least i'm assuming these were done intentionally but it's likely just examples of incompetent film-making). more often than not, when walker is wandering through the maze, you can't see his face. i guess the kid holding the camera can't look up that high... this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'dark harvest' (which doesn't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield). don't be fooled by the r rating. walker says the f word three times and now we have "an r-rated horror movie", ugh. the scarecrow on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie...and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back, you know things are bad! instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around (unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr. walker so i didn't even realize he was being followed for a while). i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did (the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). the end of the movie drags on and on...and just in case it isn't slow enough, there's some slow-motion! the last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very poor sound-dubbing. in case you can't tell, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. at least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel!

this is absolutely the most stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera. i cant believe i was gullable enough to rent this piece of junk. i have seen some bad movies in my time, but this takes the cake....ice cream ,,,, and chips too. omg, i still cant get over how bad this thing was. the acting was a joke.... the plot was non exsistant..and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child. i have never seen a movie take so long to go nowhere. i mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes. i guess this guy had some extra time on his hands.... ( like 3 hours. ) and an extra 60 bucks in his wallet, and decided one night...( hey ..lets go make the stupidest movie ever made. ) and they did just that. give me a break.i'm heading back to the video store right now to get demand my money back.anyone else who has watched this piece of trash, should do the same.

i rented dark harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on -the-box type of thrill ride. scarecrows also freak me out. the movie had an effective title sequence, but what followed was pretty lame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction...). recently, i noticed that dh 2: the maize had a pretty extensive ad campaign. i thought maybe the first one was marginally successful, so they upped the ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows. well, there are no scarecrows in the video... not a problem. the problems start in dh 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot. as far as the actual photography... every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all these blown out whites, confirming that you're watching some ultra-low budget mini-dv project that some midwesterner filmed at his uncles farm. the acting was not acting at all. the cheap rip-off of the shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards. the editing was extremely amateur and lazy. the sound was jarring and choppy. (e.g.- every time the editor would cut to a new shot, you'd here the sound change perspective with it). it's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days, put a light on top of it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, stuck the footage in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, tossed in some music, bypassed any imaginative sound work or mixing, burned it directly to dvd, and threw it on the video store shelf. any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style. just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape, doesn't mean it should be released to the public. if i could give this a rating lower than a one, i would.

no. just no. that's all that needs to be said.summary: a random guy is in a cornfield. for some reason, i'm not sure, but it's his duty to run around inside. the next great thriller?a five year old could make a better movie just filming an anthill, or even just grass growing. seriously.....you can't say it has bad acting, because there is no acting. you can't say it has bad writing, because it has no writing. you can't say it has bad cinematography, because there is no cinematography. you can't say it's a bad movie, because there is no movie! if you don't believe me, go watch it. just don't say i never warned you.....

art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore. the suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise surprise, the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as contrived as any you've seen. "the neighbours would never know about this guy," one of the filmmakers says about joel edgerton's character. "but he was completely plausible as to what he was. serial killers don't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks. they look like the guy next door." another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street. but the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that it's a genre film that nobody saw. backed by substantial funds (including some from film finance - that's government), this got a run at the underground film festival in melbourne and had to rely on acmi kindness for a *very* short release season. q1: what is the ffc doing funding genre flicks, even if they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional? q2: why are these nasty movies (acolytes; beautiful; punishment; no through road) being made in the first place? richard wolstencroft & co encourage their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want, as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want. the truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than they're due.

i couldn't even...i mean...look....okay...wow.not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit.i can only think...how. how do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed (or even their lives) and con-artists like the guy who made this get a dvd on a shelf? it seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at subway and made the worst thing he could think of."hey guys, give me some ideas. start with a corn-field and work backwards." "well, you've gotta have actors straight out of high school, and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached. and boobs." thanks, guy, i'm sure that you and windows movie maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project.

this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema. the screenplay is really well done (which is not often the case for this type of movies) and you can see that chuck (in one of his first role)is a great actor. the final fight with the sherif deputy in the bullring is a masterpiece!

this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film, and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable!, plus the low budget shows big time!. some of the fights were good, but the story is laughable, and there no menacing villains at all.the dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film, but chuck norris, made it somewhat bearable. i really have nothing more to say, since i was only paying half attention,because it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end. the direction is terrible. don hulette, does a terrible job here, with lousy photography, an awful pace, and overall the film looked dull!. there is no gore. the acting was terrible. chuck norris is very good here, he kicks that ass, and he made the film almost bearable(chuck rules!). george murdock, is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. terry o'connor, is decent here, and had okay chemistry with chuck. michael augenstein, is decent as chuck's brother. overall it's quite simple avoid! * out of 5 (chuck saves it from the bomb rating).

i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films, and it shows. we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting, but that's not what we watch him for. although there have been a few earthquakes in california since this movie was made, there never was any desert or hills between hwy.99 and i 5. billy was supposedly crossing over from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance of less that 15 miles. i wish that the writers, producers and directors of these movies would, at least, look at a map. as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california, i could tell right from the start that the geography was wrong. however, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. so grab your doritos and an adult beverage and enjoy a trip back in time.

i work in an office on weekends, and there is a tv that only gets one channel. so, i don't have the option of turning to something better. i keep it on, though, because it provides a little background noise. sometimes, i get a decent movie/show. not today. today, i got "breaker breaker." the city looks like a third rate set (which, of course, it is). all the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school. i have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival. the special effects (flames at end of movie are more fake then michael jacksons masculinity). even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor... a badly acted, badly shot, badly written movie.

ever want to see a movie where chuck norris takes the bad guys aside and calmly discusses with them the errors of their ways until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, they shake hands, right the wrongs of the world together in peace and harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world?well, forget it, jocko. "breaker! breaker!" instead goes right for the drop-kick as our truck-drivin' man chuck steers his big rig into the small backwoods town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even-more corrupt law-men. chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle-cuts every baddie in sight until not an evil-doer dares raise his head. a lot of fights are in slow-motion, for excitement purposes, but just help pad out the movie to fill 86 minutes.and there's a lot of fights here, which leave just about 15 minutes for plot development...and that's about all the plot you get. but what did you expect: calm discussion?one star for "breaker! breaker!"; and that's a small 10-4, good buddy.

ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work:first put in loads of hillbilly truckers--good ole boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands. second put in evil hillbilly cops controlled by a texas bred outlaw. third put in karate fighting trucker played by chuck norris. fourth put in a chump teenager as norris's nephew captured by evil hillbilly cops. fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion.now mix all together and what have you got?you guessed it...one very mediocre movie!

i caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. however, since it is supposed to be an action movie, i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional.chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family, and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film. good thing too, 'cuz the sub-par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast. actually, the judge was pretty good, but i can't really describe what makes him work, you'll have to check it out for yourself.and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic!

in terms of quality movies, this isn't one of them. it's actually the first chuck norris movie i've seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed. the fight scenes are slow and don't have a lot of variety. norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring. the movie also is quite short, but for some reason the movie doesn't even seem finished when it ends. it's a pretty anti-climatic ending. all the same though, i've watched a lot of bad movies, and this isn't one of the worst that i've seen. it's worth a watch, i'm guessing especially for norris fans. there's also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.

saw this used dvd cheap, and got it for a chuckle. i had recently also found "the octagon" on dvd and bought that one to reminisce, having seen it in the theatre as a pre-teen, and loving it at the time. the problem now with "going back" to these american karate films, is that i've since then seen so many hong kong and thai action films, in which the fight scenes are long, fast and jaw-dropping. i'm thinking particularly of fights like jackie and benny "the jet" at the end of "dragons forever", or tony jaa's circular-stairwell fight from "the protector". the hollywood kung-fu offerings are just not "filmed right", and even make someone of certified skill, such as chuck, look awkward at times. and what's worse than a fight going into slow motion? then you know it looked crappy at normal speed, so they slowed it down for effect. it really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks as they stand and just wait to get kicked in the chest.poor chuck, he just has no intensity in this film, nor does he project any righteous menace. compare that to his former co-star bruce lee, who had charm and attitude to burn. when bruce would square off against some opponent(s) you could nearly see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen. in "breaker, breaker" chuck seemed to accidentally be kicking people, with complete nonchalance. when the judge comes to see him in jail, and sentence him to death, chuck is staring off with a sad look, and i thought "ok...he's doing that 'third eye' focus thing and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this", but he does nothing except look up with a doe-eyed stare. terrible. and while the dvd case gives you hope, listing a run time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there's 20 more minutes of viewing pain. for great fight action, go watch jackie chan in the first "police story"....the fight in the shopping mall at the end is pure gold......

save some very early norris, "breaker, breaker" has nothing to offer which can't be found ten fold better on any broadcast channel. a pathetic attempt at film making, this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. in spite of that, i did watch it, thumbing the fast forward button, because the acting was so awful it was comical. of course, the film is supposed to be an action/drama but turned out as a treatise on how not to make a movie. everything which could be wrong with film is on screen in this "dog". if you happen across it, give it a peek. it's so bad, it's funny.

i've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies. for while i had been meaning to watch this film, but for whatever reason didn't have chance. apparently i didn't miss much. this has to be one of chuck's worst films. so this trucker, billy dawes (augenstein) is given the chance to make his delivery, but on the way he is detoured and forced into a jerkwater town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings (murdock) who runs the whole town, has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him. he denies the charges and makes a run for it. the local hick cops beat him and he disappears. but now his brother jd john dawes (norris) another trucker goes looking for him. he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town. in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio, and they all come rushing into town demolishing it. lol with there big rigs. eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs.this movie was pretty bad. it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops, because there such losers. but there is virtually no story, the acting is bad, and the ending ..well it doesn't really have one. the judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens. does he live? norris never even gets to trash him. in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end. who cares? norris also manages to take on everyone in town, gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting. come on! this movie was apparently made to cash in on the cb craze of the time, why there was one is beyond me. they barley even use the cb's in the movie. adding to this, the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. this movie is bad, but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time. as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this. 3 out of 10.

breaker! breaker! has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master, talk about juggling two disparate careers. he gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother michael augenstein and then when the young man doesn't show up, chuck goes looking for him.what young augenstein has got himself into is a speed-trap run by judge george murdock who comes from the roy bean school of jurisprudence. of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble, the call goes out over the cb for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy. this speed-trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal.chuck's of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one. he's got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the academy won't be looking at this gobbler. george murdock is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe.this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris.

summary: not worth the filmas an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

this movie was nothing like the book. i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down. this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway. the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action. none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book. for a gone with the wind fan (of both the book and the movie) this was deeply disappointing. if you loved the book scarlett, don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen. they only share the title in common.

margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess! fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley (as the title character) and the ever-bland timothy dalton (as rhett). even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script, which is astoundingly cliched and predictable. add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing, and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer. scarlett is just amazingly lousy, and i can't imagine how it ever got made, much less made it to video.

alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's. margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels. i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money.although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton, this is a really terrible film. the script is horrible and full of clichés. ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her.the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy, feral villain - lord fenton. sean bean's performance is along the lines of "the man you love to hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol.but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script.don't waste your money on this film, unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance.

i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.

...but not this one! i always wanted to know "what happened" next. we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret's baby. i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie. i did compare "scarlett" to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first. rhett was cast beautifully, although no one will ever compare to mr. gable. i am also a strict vivien leigh fan!! she was scarlett. she fit the bill. not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with "scarlett" the job could have been done better. not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett, that was evident.overall, something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett, i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction. this movie is not worth the time.

as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

i've read the book 'scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it. i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed. the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like. one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed. it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. a fine movie, but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to alexandra rippley's book.

as everyone knows, nobody can play scarlett o'hara like vivien leigh, and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable. all others pale in comparison, and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions. one thing that i really couldn't get past was that joanne has brown eyes. the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those.the movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who. i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. it could be that i'm only 11, but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say, 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up. if rhett hadn't told her that, i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. she really loved cat, her baby. she likes this child best because she had it with rhett, her only loved husband. still, if you've read gone with the wind, you would see that children make no difference in scarlett's world. quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett. all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together, and scarlett took way too long to get to that. it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind, but then again what isn't? if you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie.i would watch it, just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind, regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile. it may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.

if you really loved gwtw, you will find quite disappointing the story. those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south, will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production (altought i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett). but, let me say that considering the novel, nothing good could came out of this.i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs. mitchell did for the film. it took me some time to understand how good the ending was: scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett, since she always got what she wanted. but there was no kiss in the end.then alexandra ripley came to "fix" this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been further from mrs. mitchell mind, i am sure).the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends, showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending.if margaret mitchell could came to live again, she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw.sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault. isn't it? is it any good if i don't compare it to the original? maybe. sorry to say i don't really care.i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's (suberb) work, otherwise don't even try.

"the danish bladerunner" is boldly stated on the box. are you kidding me?! this film is a complete drag. when i'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, i usually pause the vcr, so i won't miss anything. not this time. i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so i wouldn't have to go back. why the hell is there not one sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? it's mindboggling. one of the premises of film, is that our hero (who's a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future). when he loses the assistant in the movie, he's helpless and can't get into any computers. he's a hacker! it's like saying, that you can't drive your car, if you don't have your lucky "driving-cap" on. i won't even go into the lightning-effect when he recieves electroshock...

a desperate attempt to make a "film-noir" sci-fi thriller, but the movie falls short. it has no believable plot, some of the key actors were a joke (not lars bom, he is cool!). i did like the "access restriction by bandwith maximizing" though. i finished it on principle, but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life...

i think the cards were stacked against webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but i couldn't quite put my finger on it. then it hit me. dubbed. for a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen, with just a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. this is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. i hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it.what i wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). what i got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without his little ego, and a director who obviously didn't know how to handle a camera. i just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. the editing wasn't much better. the acting? well, i guess if the lead guy didn't have such a bad script to work from, he'd be at least watchable. the main bad guy was ok, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. dubbing didn't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration.before i get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. well, one or two. despite the rudimentary graphics, i rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. the falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. the heart gadget, which reminded me of guillermo del toro's cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of escape from new york, it was horribly conceived in the long run. there's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there. why didn't he try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better.now, who here dares compare this movie to blade runner? both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. there's the investigation of a murder, but i've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either blade runner or webmaster. identity, for instance. that's about where the similarities end. period. there is no comparison, just as there wouldn't be between blade runner and hackers. ridley scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. it's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to point b by herself without the hero, so that he could do his thing. very convenient. or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.).it tries to be hip, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. but a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.

l'humanité is a murder mystery. these movies tend to be popular,and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been, too.unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.a few non-spoilers, for instance, include a 5-minute scenewherein the main character eats an apple. and another 3 minuteswhere he breathes.in case you were wondering, this is not, in fact, art. neither is it acommentary on humanity, which from the title it seems it is tryingto be. it is, in fact, boring. there are numerous attempts in thismovie to say something about humanity. one might think toonesself, "how would i comment on humanity?" and the mostobvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love, and death.not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just thatthey are the canonical options. for sex, this movie does its best tomake it unattractive and disgusting. in your first five minutes -hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of amurdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember? lateron, a few people throw themselves at each other and have whatthe director would like us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it'scontrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet, uninterestingly so.i enjoy being disturbed by movies. this movie showed me why:disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone,their humanity, which they did not know existed and are a bitscared of. l'humanité tried to do just this and failed, and i walkedout of the theatre not disturbed, but disgusted, thinking that i hadwasted my time in the theater, despite having seen the movie forfree.

although this movie has a slow, dream-like, almost mesmerizing pace, and an interesting, though possibly not entirely accurate, description of a rural french constabulary's criminal investigation practices and personnel, i find it, ultimately, impossible to recommend. i think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one person's -- the director's, one presumes -- disgust with heterosexuality. certainly, human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments, no denying that! but to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good, as this film does at every turn, suggests a warped sensibility at work. in short, if you enjoy watching homo-eroticism masquerading as compassion, and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a hideous and degrading light - then this movie is for you. i don't , and it wasn't.

this french film is supposedly about a creepy, dim-witted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. however, the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. if it takes a character ten minutes to walk from point a to point b, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. there are also static shots that last for minutes, making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote. the script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. the movie lasts seven hours or so. you do the math. the actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. note to self: never see a dumont movie again.

just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film.think of that scene in magnolia at the end with the slow pan in on that woman. now, remove the pan, add breathing and unshaven men to the mix, and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of humanity wasthe inspector is a true dolt, not even a dolt, just a dim witted, slow moving simpleton. how they ever solved a crime is beyond me.obligatory sex scenes are awful, and gratitious.eventual villain of the piece (he raped and killed an 11 year old girl) is signposted very early and no surprise unless your are similarly dimwitted.uninspiring camera work.the director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings. i assume he also meant provide their own dialogue (there is bugger all - adding to its boredom level), inventive camera work (just static shots, totally stripping away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in) and plot!truly awful.0 out of 10.

i can't remember when was the last time i have been so terribly disappointed by any movie. probably i expected too much happening (in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course). but there is just nothing going on in here. luckily i was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumb/numb faces started to kill me. and that was very often! it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly, stroke pigs and french kiss men, not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex. if only it made any sense... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; seems like it was only created to show one more vagina since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime. having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer. and that makes no sence either. despite all the boredom and suffering i must admit that it somehow touched me in an unexplainable way. maybe you should check it out yourself though i don't recommend it.

the main character, pharaon, has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past. he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally. too long a movie, too much time spent on pharaon's inexpressive face, too much "road time" (one of the banes of tv: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) long scenes of him doing trivial - sometimes totally inexplicable, nonsensically trivial - actions with neither reason or emotion. his best friends joseph and domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase "gratuitous sex"); domino and pharaon's mother are the two characters who display some emotion, but not much. it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie: is it indifferent acting, indifferent writing, or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. characters in this film talk very little to anyone; it's little wonder their emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other.

a trio sit at a restaurant table and stare wordlessly into space. later, they lean on a rail and stare across the channel at england. a man works a hoe repetitively in his garden, only his head and upper torso visible on the screen. a man and a woman watch another man peeing against a stone wall. each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute. absolutely no information is imparted that could not be given to us in about one quarter of the time. the editor must have been half asleep. i know i was.the movie open with a startling shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body. one's gorge rises. but then the policeman (schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins to tag along after them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while schotte and his friends trade unfunny insults with each other and with strangers. eventually the thread of the case is picked up again but proceeds slowly, almost aimlessly, following the stylistic pattern already established.sometimes in movies like this, the location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story, but not here. the houses of the french village are attached to one another in long rows. the house fronts abut the pavement directly, with no steps. the fronts show virtually no decoration and are pretty much indistinguishable. the flat farmlands are featureless. what might have been one of the more interesting episodes -- a visit to a stone fort on the coast -- bores the trio until they begin behaving like snots and are asked to leave.the acting is minimal. nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything. no jokes are made. nothing amusing happens. the policeman has a face almost as interesting as randy quaid's. the babe, a tall hefty blonde, looks like the kind of shot putter on steroids that the east germans used to field at the olympic games.i sat through more than an hour of it before giving it up. maybe i'll take a crack at it some other time. unless i've missed something or unless it turns into some deranged monty python routine towards the end, i don't think you'll get much out of renting it.

i saw this film at the edinburgh film festival, and would not recommend it. it is two and a half hours long, during which nothing much happens at a wading-through-porridge pace.the main characters are gormless and totally lacking in charisma or personality. no-one smiles at all during the film (neither would i if i had their lives), and although domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all.the whole experience is depressing and ponderous, the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique.too many questions were left in my mind: why does he sniff the algerian man's head? why does he levitate? what is he looking at over the allotment fence? why does he kiss joseph? why did we go and see this rubbish rather than ordering another bottle of wine in bouzy rouge?

playmania is extremely boring. this is the basis of the show. mel or shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old could answer at an extremely slow pace. this show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period. people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy, but they're hotness completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoying.during the show they mention that we need more players a million times. the top 5 surveys that they do probably takes about 20 minutes out of the show. this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. one of the reasons they probably don't have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money. the most money i've ever seen them hand out was $210. i wouldn't be surprised if this "game show" is canceled by the end of 2006.

it really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie. the beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. the partisan "af" was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the croat ustashi af deserted, together with their observers, in breguet 19 and potez 33, respectively. the aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but didn't last very long. one crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot being killed later while flying a spitfire vc. the real partisan squadrons were established when raf detached two of its (yugoslav) squadrons of spitfire vc and, hurricane iic , respectively, manned by ex yugoslav royal airforce pilots, and allotted them to tito's forces on the island of vis. even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. so the film was one giant cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, otherwise not at all bad, director. by some quirk of fate i was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie, when dozens of german aircraft were destroyed (yugoslav 522 trainers, used also in the flying sequences) on the mostar military airport. the pyrotechnics were impressive, and the scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better. otherwise, the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience.

throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the "partisans"  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading german forces. hajrudin krvavac, who's generally only known in eastern europe, directed quite a few of these "partisan" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the europe and the united states. "battle of the eagles" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the partisan air force.marshal tito decrees that a partisan air force must be formed to combat the german luftwaffe in the skies over yugoslavia. a group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable  whatever it is, it sure isn't convincing, but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work.the film opens strongly with a well-shot german air raid on defenseless partisans. the nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. then the action starts, and this title quickly becomes yet another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure. all of the characters are familiar clichés: major dragan (played by a well-meaning bekim fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. he blasts away at strafing planes with a machine-gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous klauberg (radko polic), a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome. the rest of the partisans are familiar: ljubisa samardzic ("the battle of neretva") is a zare, a hotshot playboy; bata zivojinovic ("hell river") is voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him; and rados bajic ("the day that shook the world") is dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks, eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot. the characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan, and krvavac doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes. the cast does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional script, every player is engaging and fun to watch. bajic, in particular, has some great moments  when he's going to take his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed. the plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the germans, and subsequent retaliatory acts.krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects. unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and false-looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable. some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just plain pathetic. sometimes smoke puffs from the "machine-guns" are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane. worse, the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage. although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective, they're surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism. all of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by bojan adamic."battle of the eagles" also suffers from a very poorly edited english-language release. to begin with, 28 minutes of footage is missing  cutting the film from 130 minutes to a mere 102. the missing segments were carelessly excised, and the cutting looks very sloppy. music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. in the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some badly-needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. then, there's the dubbing all of the scenes revolving around the partisans are dubbed in english (rather poorly, however), yet several lengthy scenes remain in german, without the benefit of subtitles. the film might have made much more sense had the german-language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the partisans.on the plus side, krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well. there is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a soundstage. in particular, the german luftwaffe bases are expansive, complete with dozens of messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets. the scenery is fresh and green, and krvavac isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek. a german ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out, as does a sequence where zare and dalibor escape from an enemy base.as it exists on home video, "battle of the eagles" is just another of many stories about the yugoslav partisan movement. there is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable. try to avoid this one unless you can find a full-length copy.

took a chance to see if perhaps a really good wwi film had slipped my notice--this isn't it. john phillip law and don stroud are both stiff in their acting and miscast for their roles. the dialogue is dumb or non-existent; the flying sequences are okay but pretty repetitive. compared to the terrific "blue max" this movie should never have been made. watch george peppard,james mason, and usula andress in the bm and you get why that movie is one of the best war films ever made and this isn't. recently released on dvd richtofen and brown is presented as some great 'lost classic' from the 70's, i resold mine the day after i bought it. don't waste your time or $.

as a flying and war movie buff, this ranks at he bottom of my list. it is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a high-school play. the acting, script, direction, production standards and casting are all garbage. the only saving grace is some of the flying sequences. if the people they portray were fictitious, i might rate it a 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies, it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be, actually did this! its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable ww1 personalities as possible.there are many good ww1 flying films and this is not one of them.

i don't see the sense in going through so much trouble to make a movie like this, and then throw the history book out the window. there wasn't a single accurate detail in that movie other than the fact than richtofen died, which i was grateful for at the end so i didn't have to watch any more. movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about wwi aerial history.i'll skip the obvious, that they were flying fokker dvii's in 1916, because the blue max did that too, or that 209 squadron was flying se-5's, and will attack other parts. for one thing, they call the pfalz d-iii an 'old albatross' at the beginning. for another, they have voss, goring, and wolff all in jasta boelcke. the only one who was in that jasta was voss, and he joined after boelcke died. richtofen wasn't held to blame for boelcke's death...erwin boehme, who collided with boelcke, had swerved to avoid a british plane that richtofen was chasing. when richtofen received his head wound, it was while attacking a fe-2d two-seater, and he did not crash into the trenches and have soldiers fight over him, and no..werner voss did not die that day. he died september 28th in one of the most epic battles in wwi.manfred was short, not like the actor who towered over everyone else. his brother lothar was never in jasta boelcke either, he joined the squadron when manfred was in charge of jasta 11.there's so many other glaring errors in historical fact that i'll let them go except perhaps the worst one, the death scene. in the movie manfred is out-maneuvered by brown and then shot down, making a perfect landing. brown got off one burst at richtofen while richtofen was chasing may, and the facts amassed over the years overwhelmingly show that richtofen was killed by ground fire, not by brown.the only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves, which were as good as 'the blue max', other than that i won't watch it again and i paid $30 for the tape!

i found this movie at the flea market for cheap. i was so psyched because i thought it was a skateboarding movie. i got home put it on, the previews rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the skateboard was awesome. at that moment i realized it was a post-apocalyptic movie but i still had high hopes for it. this movie was awful. a friend of mine was stoned out of his mind when we watched it and even he thought it was horrible and a waste of being high. i kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was utterly awful. i don't know if during the apocalypse all the good music, and all the music that is only kind of crappy is destroyed and everyones memory of how to play it is wiped clean but i think i would rather die than have to endure that crap. also what the hell was up with the tv studio? i can only assume that this movie was adapted from an old greek play, with the names and title, but some plays are not meant to be adapted into a futuristic sci-fi setting. or at least not by the people who were involved with this movie. if you are forced to watch this movie, i can only suggest bringing a hand gun and finishing yourself off before the end. it would be a good movie to kill yourself too, everyone will understand why.

i was completely bored with this film, melodramatic for no apparent reason. every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions. then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill one person to get the title of serial killer. well the serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films;why oh why? i nave no idea. it really really wants to be scary, but i think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noises.just for the record, this is in no way is a horror film, its most definitely a thriller (barely). really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making "horror" films or at least calling a movie a "horror" film. it makes me say (in too may words ironically) "acolytes, you take forever to say nothing."

wow. they told me it was bad, but i had no idea.we've started a tradition. we found one copy of this movie, and we just pass it from person to person. whoever has the movie watches it, and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique, creative, horrible movie. hopefully it'll travel 'round the world a few times.it's painful. really painful. it's even beyond so bad it's funny. well, okay, sometimes it's so bad it's funny. but most of the time it just gives you that feeling that there's something sucking at your brain from the inside.wow. watch it, then pass it.

i cannot see why anyone would make such a movie. from start to finish this film is really, really bad.the characters are all very shallow, terribly acted and downright annoying. there is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters or plot.the 'humour' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience ( i presume from the language and nudity) although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half-witted 16 year old.i would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. it has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan. non-existent laughs and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask "why has this film been made, why, why, why?"i expect in the fullness of time to see this film topping the top 100 worst films.

as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance, i cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct-to-video grade-c porn movie in which either a) the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b) the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts (an amazing thing if it were true).i had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i had rented it, which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs, which seemed to imply a seditious john waters-style humor-fest with a sexual theme. okay, i laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme (although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way). but, on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctly--on this one, you fast-forward because you already know what they're about to say. but there's nothing to fast-forward to, so just fast-forward past it on the shelf.

ed wood rides again. the fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids. watching thismovie made me realize that boa vs. python was not that bad after all. it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. it is understandable why this director has so many aliases. there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you tomake your toward your tv set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.

poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. special effects are cheap. best performance is by yvette napir, but that's not saying much. story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard. there is little suspense and even less action. there's one car chase that's not bad, but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time.

rented this tonite from my local video store. it was titled "black horizon." i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re-release...micheal dudikoff is unfortunetly not a ninja in this movie, one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat. another major flaw would be that ice-t's action scenes are stolen from other movies, particularly the first scene of his rescue, which is directly from the wesley snipes movie "the art of war," with ice-t edited in. i hope they paid for that footage.the plot is awful, the special effects had little effort put into them (love those wires holding them in space), the acting is wooden (also love those new york/russian accents). ice-t being in the movie is pointless. these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space, but i guess they weren't worried about it.micheal dudikoff should go back to doing what he's "good" at and make american ninja 6.

i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. it was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better. then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back. ice-t did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. the pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits. the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days. all in all, i have seen worse but this sure isn't one i'd recommend or want to remember.

i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan. i figured it couldn't be that bad. boy was i wrong! at the 15 minute mark , i was begiing the others to let me rip the dvd out and fling it back to the rental store, but they refused. they swore it had to get better.they were wrong! this movie was lacking everything. the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it. none of the characters interacted very well with each other. ice-t gives one of his worst performances here.after watching footage of the wrong plane, bad guys standing up to get shot, and clips being emptied and missing everything, i wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete. the movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel. space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may say.i didn't finish this movie and hated it. i don't want to finish this movie. this is slow suicide. i could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture i put it through.

i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful!!, as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, not a damn thing happens!. all the characters are dull, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring!,plus the ending is especially lame!. the only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of michael dudikoff, however he is wasted here, and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever!, plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over!. it's like the movie had no plot and it was all about nothing, and ice-t is god awful(even though he is ok in some stuff), plus dudikoff and yvette nipar had no chemistry together at all. there's one scene that the director tried to make emotional but he fails miserably as yvette nipar didn't really show all that much emotion, however there is a decent car chase scene, but that's not enough for me to recommend this god awful film!, plus the dialog is atrocious. avoid this movie like the plague not a damn thing happens, please avoid and trust me on this one you may thank me afterwords. the direction is horrible!. fred olen ray does a horrible job here, with shoddy camera work, laughably cheap looking set pieces, terrible angles, laughable use of stock footage, and keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace. the acting is terrible!. michael dudikoff is nowhere near his usual amazing self, he looks extremely bored, and shows no emotion what so ever, his character is also extremely dull, as i can't believe he signed on for this piece of garbage, he also had no chemistry with yvette nipar(dudikoff still rules!!!). ice-t has barely anything to do and also looks bored, and he didn't convince me one bit. hannes jaenicke is not very good here, he had somewhat of a wimpy character, i didn't like him. yvette nipar is pretty but was really terrible here, she didn't show much emotion, and had no chemistry with dudikoff, and as a result i didn't give a damn about her character!. art hindle,(owen marsh),kathy harren(katharine marsh), and the rest of the cast are bad as well. overall please avoid like the plague!, fred olen ray and steve lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves!. bomb out of 5

the russian space station 'avna' with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to re-enter the earth's atmosphere in a matter of days. russia asks for nasa's help in rescuing the stranded crew and nasa scrambles the space shuttle atlantis. the nsa also have an interest in the 'prometheus', a prototype microwave power source being tested aboard 'avna' and organise for one of their men to be placed on the mission.that's the plot. onto less important things. the space station and the shuttle are the same, blatantly obvious models used in 'fallout', 'memorial day' and 'dark breed' (and a handful of other films, i suspect). the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s. the sets are a little better but are far too '80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company (which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy 'avna' and the 'prometheus' and claim the insurance. the script has a few good moments (including yuri's farewell and the little spiel at the end) but is otherwise fairly bland and sub-standard. the acting is okay; the only real standout performance comes from alex veadov who offers up some of the film's better dialogue. michael dudikoff is, surprisingly, one of the best parts about this film. ice-t is ice-t. 'nuff said. the film offers a few surprises, though, that i don't wish to spoil.certainly one of the better low-grade, contemporary-set sci-fi films of the last six years, but not the best. the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off. rent the other 'stranded' sci-fi film instead.

admittedly, you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci-fi, and thats enough to get me interested, so if you are like that, black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it. the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch.the movie plays like the naked gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clichés and bad acting. unfortunately, i don't think they meant to be funny, the actors really are made of cardboard, the dialog really does suck, so well just have to laugh at them, and not with them.on a side note, it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space, half on earth, and doesn't mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors.

what a clunker!it must have been made for tv or cable.look: forget the screenplay - forget the bunch of forgettable actors. excuse me? continuity? the nsa/nia/whatever or whoever he is (an agent) takes-off in an f16 - is shown in an f18 chucking his guts up and, later, the aircraft shown taxiing is an f4 phantom! oooh, wish that i could be so cavalier.apart from the male actors(!?) the women are wasps: blue-eyed and long-legged and, eventually, get to cry about the heroes who save them. even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo- astro-nauts, the blond drops the welding tool. duh!as an sf movie one out of ten. as a movie per se: 1/2 (that's a half point). they should have ditched the space station and headed for mars.major raspberries.

this is one the worst movie i've seen and certainly worst movie nagesh kuknoor has made. i can't believe person who has created movie like teen deewarein can create utter crap like this. plot of the film itself is really faulty that zeenat has to search meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in soudi arabia. common logic says if zeenat cannot search meera easily so won't the soudi government, so zeenat can safely forge meera's signature or thumb-print and produce it before the soudis. another silliest thing is shankar has given incorrect address in his passport, so indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime meera gets shankar's suitcase through soudi government. wow! doesn't it make soudis well networked in india more than indians?nagya makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of chopra, who is eyeing meera and seeks meera's father-in-law, girish karnaad(this guy is just wasted)'s help to get her as a keep. nagya cannot speak hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the english dialogs he writes, in hindi. this time, it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication, when writing dialogs like "imaan ki chalaang" (leap of honesty). within minutes, to our worst nightmares, meera not only takes this honest leap, she taps her feet to do "imaan ka naach" (dance of honesty).one of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues. but since bollywood has learned the thing called post-production, almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops, so no big deal.conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to chopras or johars or barjatyas, nagyas and all are ready to get affected.

i have read the other user comments and i am happy someone has compared it to the original by kamal called perumarzhakalam released in 2004.the original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the indian govt not having proper records, or even bad shoots and bloopers.the story is great and a touchy one and well described by others. but sadly nagesh taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than plagiarism.i guess he has been affected by bollywood's so called "inspired" syndrome.he must at least give credit where it is due.i liked some of his older movies, but now i suspect if any of them were originals after all.here is a link in imdb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment i recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles if needed, to know what class direction and class acting is all about.

opie, tom gilson,was my brother,so i went to see the movie and i never looked at it again in all these years. sorry! it was bad. i'm told i have to write 10 lines so i'll put a little trivia in. tom and tuesday weld were to be " introduced " in this picture and tom was told to take tuesday to the premiere but tom said no he was going with joan collins, and he did and because he did only tuesday weld was introduced. i found this very funny back then and still do. the movie, while the concept was a funny one, and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just did'nt come out funny.the continuity was abstract, at best,it was like i was watching 2 different movies at the same time,each running into the other. sorry, bob gilson

this is total swill. if you take the devil's rejects and suck all the good out of it, and add a lot of twisted, kinky bondage parts, a few rape scenes, and like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes, and you'd get this movie. people are calling this a ripoff of '86's the hitcher, but i don't see that at all. even the worst hitcher ripoffs are still better than this. the main problem on display here is that there's really nothing here besides a few of the director's fetishes being showcased like circus exhibits. is all you need out of a movie shots of girls being abused and tied up, cowering in fear? well, then rent this movie!however, i'd rather just watch a good movie, which this is clearly not. the sad thing is, there are some really good thrills waiting to be uncovered here, but only a few. for instance, the suspense at the beginning before the bondage nonsense started...pretty damn good if you ask me. and the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (can't remember names) is chilling, very brutal in a way, challenging even the devil's rejects for unbridled fury. how come the rest of the movie can't be that good? huh? i really need to stop renting stupid crap like this. closing message: just let this gutter trash die and forget it forever. not recommended.

about the spoiler warning? it's not "may contain", it -does- contain spoilers. readers beware. okay, first i need it to be known that i'm not bashing the actors. they're just working with what they're given. the problem was the script. it was horrendous. there was nothing believable about it at all. sure, when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, there's going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific, movie-worthy situation. but these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision. the only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because he'd already killed one and hit another with a car. speaking of hitting her with a car...why the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person? also, does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood? frankly, it wasn't suspenseful either. the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were. well, this rant has gone on way longer than i meant to for such a bad movie, so i won't bother to touch on the end besides the fact it's unrealistic and lame.

this movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. the suspense created disappeared because of horrible acting or lack of direction from the director.. i don't know.. it was like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once tasted great. like most thrillers the hitchhiker had promise yet failed to deliver when it had me bright eyed and ready to turn the volume down(i was watching the movie alone.. in the dark) this so called thriller simply came apart like it was made of lego transforming into something else. it simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a made-for-tv-like style movie with one exception.. it was probably rated-r.

ok i went to this website before i watched this movie, read the comments, got pumped, - cause they where all pretty good for a b-flick - watched it and was completely disappointed. the main characters wannabe lone rebel straight out of the mid-west act was sickening to the stomach, and don't even get me started on the two cops, i mean there's a bloody door right there in plain view, check it out! the plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, i swear the editor was even dozing off near the end when he was cutting this movie, and the direction was clouded by bad cinematography. now please don't get me wrong, i love b-flicks, some are really good.want to watch a good b rated flick???dave recommends" high tension "http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/

first, the current imdb plot description seems to be misleading, the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker, who plans to kill them all. they stop at a small motel, where he holds them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. violence ensues.i picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie "the hitcher". not that the hitcher is any better, and i was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway, but this was almost unbearable at times. i think i could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this.i can't even count how many movies i've seen with virtually the same storyline, so this was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example. at one point a door is covered in (what is very obviously) blood, and two police officers, at the scene because of a 911 call, are looking at it from 30 feet away, see a man, also covered in blood, walk out of the door, agree that it looks suspicious, but decide to not investigate further.but, however ridiculous it may be, the movie was never boring, was well produced, directed, and acted, complete with good special effects, gratuitous nudity, and violence. i probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to have on while i cleaned my basement. also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies, and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching.

this movie is watchable, but nothing special. four girls on a road trip to vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he is cute). they all end up staying the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the hitchhiker's psychotic issues with women become apparent.the characters are clichés--there is a married, responsible woman; a slutty party girl; an unsure bride-to-be; and a man-hater who just got dumped. the hitchhiker is genuinely nice until he goes crazy.there's not nearly enough gore, and way too much rape. i enjoy slasher horror/thrillers a lot, and this one did nothing for me. the ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie.on the positive side, the actors did a great job with that they had to work with. the dialogue isn't awful, and overall i was impressed with the cast, having never seen or heard of any of them before. and the plot wasn't out of the realm of possibility (although i really doubt any woman in this day and age would pick up a hitchhiker--no matter how attractive he is), so i wasn't groaning that things didn't make sense.overall, "the hitchhiker" was well-acted and made sense, but wasn't very interesting. there are a lot of better movies in the same genre that i would recommend over this one ("rest stop," "the devil's rejects," "texas chainsaw massacre," even "the hitcher" remake). do yourself a favor and skip it unless you don't have any other options.

i can't believe that i actually sat thru this entire film. a friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good. in it's defense, the jacket was correct; there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in overnight. from the jacket, it sounded like this was on par with freddy, jason, or maybe "the shining." it couldn't be farther from the truth.if you are a fan of minimalist and/or surrealist films, you may enjoy it. if you're looking for a good fright movie, or a couple of thrills, go rent jason vs freddy iv -- you'll have a much better night.

spoiler ahead! the mummy (lon chaney jr.) is on the loose in a new england college town searching for a college student (ramsey ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess ananka. dull, slow (even at 65 minutes--it moves slower than the mummy!), indifferently acted, but the ending is worth waiting for. the mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she ages rapidly as the both slowly sink in a swamp. this is (i believe) the only time in a universal monster movie that the monster got the girl! that aside, this is stricly amateur night. probably the worst of the mummy sequels--and that's saying something!

lon chaney jr returns to lumber along as the mummy kharis seeking his mate, annanka whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of descendant amina(ramsay ames). andoheb, high priest of arkan(george zucco)leaves yousef bey(john carradine)in charge of kharis to continue their evil-doing ways. tom(robert lowery)must find a way to save his beloved amina from certain future mummy terror.routine, predictable entry in the kharis series proves that nearly every film follows a specific format/formula. the city is threatened by a skulking, one-armed corpse masked in wrapping who seems to have been gifted with superhuman power to choke the life out of able-bodied men who are restrained with relative ease by a mere chokehold from kharis. frank reicher, who saw kharis in action..and knows a great deal about egyptian history..in the previous film(the mummy's tomb), proves that anyone who happened to survive a previous encounter with the mummy is sure to die if he returns in the next flick. well produced, but lacks originality that would set it apart from the other films in the series. sadly, carradine sleepwalks through his role as the evil yousef bey. embarrassing script mistake has kharis, who is known for donning a crippled, lame right arm, carrying an unconscious amina with both arms for long distances with no ill effects. one aspect, the shocking climax where tom's attempt at heroism doesn't go according to plan as kharis holds his damsel-in-distress hostage, lifts the film from the doldrums slightly.

perhaps the weakest film in the "kharis" series, despite the presence of john carradine (miscast as an egyptian high priest) and george zucco (as his predecessor, hilariously afflicted by a bad case of parkinson's disease) supporting lon chaney jr. as the titular creature - if indeed it was him under the bandages, as his contribution is negligible at best! it's a watchable 60 minutes in itself, i guess, but the standards have considerably lowered when compared even to the two previous entries, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead happens to be the reincarnation of princess ananka, mentioned a great deal in earlier films but never actually seen.

if at all possible, try to view all five of the universal "mummy" films in order, not so much for the continuity between films, but for the very evident lack thereof. of course it goes without saying that the original boris karloff classic "the mummy" really shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the so called "sequels", all of which come off as campy or cultish. this time around, it's revealed that the mummified remains of princess ananka have made their way to the united states. and once again, as your eyes deceive you, kharis the mummy didn't really die for the second time in "the mummy's tomb", but is alive and searching for his lost love princess ananka, with the help of the rhetorical nine tana leaves brewed during the cycle of the full moon. to complete the mythology, kharis needs a caretaker, ably filled by a gaunt john carradine as yousef bey, entrusted with the task by george zucco's andoheb, high priest of arkan. kharis and ananka are to be returned to their final resting place in the hills of arkan in egypt. but as we've seen before, being entrusted with the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure, with carradine's character falling for the reincarnation of ananka, amina monsouri (ramsay ames). it's shocking to see yousef bey and the po'ed bandaged one come to blows over the gorgeous amina. riddle me this - in both "tomb" and "curse", lon chaney portrays the mummy with a limp right arm folded helplessly across his chest. when he encounters the fainted amina, he lifts her up in both arms with no problem; as soon as he puts her down his right arm returns to it's crippled position once again.the ending of the film is most notable - the monster gets the girl! but it's a short lived victory, as the mummy and his kidnapped bride succumb to a swampy grave, an ancient egyptian curse is fulfilled - "the fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods shall be a cruel and violent death".

look, some film has got to the be worst ever. i suggest it may be india song. when i saw the film in 1976 it was playing at the carnegie hall cinema, a place frequented by people who care a lot about film. from about the halfway point, people were simply flooding out of the theater. my girlfriend wouldn't let us leave, but by the end, the theater was virtually empty. i kept telling people as they left that "the good part is still to come." and it was. the good part was the screen at the end that said "fin." it was the only good part. i am still annoyed by this film 24 years later. it was pointless, stupid and derivative (marienbad, part 2). see it only if you want to spend an endless two hours learning to distinguish between merely bad and simply awful.

i felt as though the two hours i spent watching this film may have been better served by perhaps going to the local used bookstore and looking for old fashion magazines and halston ads. or perhaps by watching paint dry. those two employments would have at least engaged my mind a bit more than "india song." the most frustrating part of sitting through this was that i could see what moods/atmospheres were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been fleshed out more. instead, what happened was a presentation of an incoherent, silly chain of nonevents - with the same scenes rehashed over and over to beat some sort of point into our senses.i was loathe to devote more time to this film by writing any sort of review, except to perhaps warn other folks against this waste of time.

extremely boring..i don't care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby sucks...and don't go and see it because i mentioned that, save it for warhol's "empire", it's far more entertaining!! i have seen other duras films that were far better, so i am dumbfounded why this is considered a "masterpiece". as an art historian, i have had to consider radical works by marcel duchamp, chris burden, and damien hurst, and in these artist i can still see artistic intent , even quality, and an entertaining aspect in the rendering of their art. as for "india song" -it's not even soft-porn- anias nin was almost here - g-rated slide show of sex- and a voice-over that does not relate to the slide show / movie......pure crap and not even campy...sadly just a bore and a waste of 2 hours. to add insult to injury, the print i saw was faded and scratched to hell!!! (harvard film archive), if i want to see "entertaining boring" i watch bunuel!! yes "india song"- hold your head high to late modernism and be truly bored!! watch a 70's porn film with all the good parts cut out and turn the sound down, you'll get "india song" but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or the screams of the vice consul!!!.

imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over. now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes  a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow, semi-lucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they're showing you. great  you've just imagined the entirety of the film `india song.'the film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out `look at me! i am profound!!' with such blatant self-importance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity, but comically bereft of profundity. the visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above, since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen, and even when they are, the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture. they never speak or interact in any meaningful way  they just stand there looking at each other, and occasionally crying. the most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion. in fact, the visuals could easily have been left out entirely, as the story is told completely through narration. the story is about a woman who hates india because it's hot, and hates people don't hate india because it's hot (this point is covered several times). it is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman, since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to, but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks, and he's very upset about this. so he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek. later on, he stares at his bicycle, as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek. actually, you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his bicycle, but you know it's there anyway, just because that's the sort of film this is.at best, the narration becomes background hum, serving as a perfect compliment to the coma-inducing visuals. simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination. to watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark. this film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic pretension that man will ever know.

this film has an amazing cast. mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret o'brien. lionel barrymore, edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home. while they have amassed a fortune over the years, they also have been selfish jerks. one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name (sort of like carnegie) but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to o'brien. and, since she's an orphan, they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great philanthropists.there also is a goofy subplot involving fairies--led by the wonderful character actor henry davenport. and, since o'brien is irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little people make up much of the plot. frankly, i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely. instead, the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old men's hearts--this would have worked. but...the "little people"?!? sheesh! overall, the actors try very, very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe. i noticed a lot of people liked this film--i guess i'm just an old grouch! i found the film horrible difficult to watch.

shameless waste of my time as a viewer. this is one of the worst films i've seen in ages. please do not rent it as you will regret doing so! guaranteed! i wonder how kathleen turner ended up in this! she is a legitimate actress and people would perhaps be attracted to this film because of her. but it really is better to act as if this title was never made! it should not have come into existence!

a rather lame teen slasher from brisbane. while the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea, the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. the problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown, but if they were that devil-may-care, it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable, so they end up being neither really. in fact, i only started enjoying the film when i started wishing for their death. one of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. i realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't. avoid.

i supposed i was actually expecting a bollywood remake of "the fog", from the title, but this is actually more of a bollywood remake of "i know what you did last summer", with some elements of "scream", kind of, sort of, and not a very good one either. apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers, this is pretty terrible. it's obviously got a decent budget & yet it's wasted on reheated leftovers that weren't that tasty to begin with. a young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (she, thankfully, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but she enters anyway and wins, and of course the creepy guy comes after her, and is killed, after which comes a rousing game of "hide the body". of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist. interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers, especially the celebratory dance number at the party for simran, the girl who won the beauty contest...it's highly colorful, it's well done & downright fun, and utterly wasted in this terrible film. i would much rather watch an old ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap, although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available, for the most part, which is a crime in itself. but not as big of a crime as this film. i took one for the team watching this one, so take my advice, don't bother. 2 out of 10.

legend has it that at the gala hollywood premiere screening of 2001: a space odyssey, about 20 minutes into the film rock hudson yelled out "would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about?" well, i have rock beaten by about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. this movie made absolutely no sense at all. who were those people? where were those people? what were the rules of the game called quintet? are there any rules to quintet? were robert altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along? what was paul newman thinking when he signed on to this? maybe ol' fast eddie saw zardoz and thought "well if connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense, so can i." maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff. also, did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats? you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life. quintet just confirms what i've always thought: when altman's good he's superb, but when he's bad, he makes stuff like quintet

quintet marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction. it was said of newman that he could not do comedy, but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot. but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again.this is one of the biggest downer films i've ever seen. it's a futuristic ice age, brought on by who knows what, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life, but apparently not here. seals have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outside.but hunters do need a little r&r and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of russian roulette. to win you have to kill five other participants in your game.it's a sad turn to see what man has come down to. which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story. the atmosphere is bleak, the story is bleak, the people are bleak, it's all so bleak. no wonder this thing came up short at the box office.it's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films, including me.this is man's future, what a bummer.

the best thing i can say about "quintet" is that it's not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first viewing.but that doesn't mean it's good.this weird, sci-fi thriller is not quite like any other movie i've ever seen, which i guess at least gives it the stamp of novelty. but it's a borderline disaster of a movie, and one of the worst robert altman ever made. on the dvd special feature about the making of "quintet," it's clear that even altman didn't know what the hell the movie was supposed to be.it's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. the film was shot at the abandoned site of the montreal expo '67, and i do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements, even if much of it looks like it's being filmed in an iced-over shopping mall. paul newman, looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him, and brigitte fossey, play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for newman's brother. soon newman is caught up in a deadly game of "quintet," which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do, and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience. all we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else you're playing with and remain the only person alive. this gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill, because as one of them says at one point in a psychobabblish soliloquy, only by being near to death can one appreciate being alive.the movie is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its unrelenting gloominess. it's almost as if altman was purposely setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through. there aren't characters -- oh sure, actors walk around speaking lines, but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors altman assembled for this register not a whit. only bibi andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this. but nevertheless, it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness, and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly starve himself to death would be fascinating.altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films. "quintet" followed close on the heels of the atrocious "a wedding" and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable "a perfect couple," the by-all-accounts terrible "health" (which i've never seen because it's not available anywhere to see) and the disastrous "popeye." thank god he rebounded.grade: d-

the things that i find irritating on screen, the things i nitpick about and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those moment where the writer, director, set-designer, on screen caterer, or whoever, doesn't think it through to the end and, by a single act of omission - or commission - undoes all the other work done by everyone else who has worked on the movie. that moment of "wait a bloody minute.... what just happened?" that stops the narrative dead in its tracks. (not that this film's narrative needed a lot of stopping, because anyone who has ever seen it will know that quintet's narrative drive has pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot.) there are several of those moments in this movie. and you get so long to think about them too. the film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably ran to five pages. there's a lot of time to ponder its deficiencies.the movie is set in a frozen earth. another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying. it's cold. very cold. it's actually very cold on the screen. the movie was shot in canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow and people's breath misting from their mouths in every scene. time and again we are reminded how fecking cold it is. people wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and waddle around like over-dressed weeble people. must have been a horrible shoot. my nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero checks into a room of a hotel. woken up in the middle of the night by voices coming from the room next door, he overhears a conversation of vital importance to the meagre plot through an large grill in the wall dividing the two rooms. i'm not questioning why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms. what got me annoyed was the fact that the grill had not been blocked up by the long term tenant with the noisy visitor. if you are trying to keep warm the last thing you need is a huge gaping draughty hole in your wall that leads into an unoccupied unheated room. trust me. i live like this, i watched this film sat on my living-room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle. my breath was misting as much as the actors'. if that whacking great hole was in my wall i'd block it up with something. maybe not the best choice of movie to watch in an unheated room in midwinter but boy did it make me notice the lousy insulation in the film.

this was a decent movie for the first half. too many cheap boo! moments but the tension builds, the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely. the kids are not particularly deep but hey, that works for teens. then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard- the "why in the world would he/they do that?" moments overwhelm anyone's capacity for suspension of disbelief, the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped. there was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny. great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together. some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes.

chayanne is beautiful enough, vanessa is beautiful enough, i liked the storyline. but i went in with the expectation to see lots of energetic hot salsa dancing, i was disappointed. there needed to be more dancing, especially salsa.

the only good part of this movie was the ending. you know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. no no that may be a little harsh - the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended. as long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well. as for chayanne's debut - not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth. as for going to see the movie wait for the rental or tv. do not make the same mistake i did and pay 8.50

it is sad what they are letting into film festivals these days. i had to sit through over twenty minutes of this dreary short that wasn't funny at all to get a good seat for a feature film that i wanted to see at a local film festival. the festival planners paired this horrible short with a great feature. i am just glad the feature was good, otherwise i would have not been a very happy camper!for a comedy short film it got no laughs. the title says it all.

directed by the same jin ishimoto that put neoedision and flixer.com (a once promising online film community) temporarily out of business and off the net because of his directorial style and method of filmmaking on his next film girl's best friend.the hole suffers from this "look at me, i am a filmmaker" style of filmmaking that is becoming the near standard in today's hollywood, to the detriment of content.the hole actually starts out with a unique concept but that concept and the promise of captivating content soon is destroyed by the "look at me" directorial style of filmmaking.there are some funny moments that still shine through the pretense but it is a painful short to watch.how sad it is when the new breed of "filmmakers" choose not to be a servant to the story but rather try and dominant on and off screen. heck, they don't care, as long as they get their studio deal, house on the beach and a new car, content and presentation are secondary issues.the real sad part of all this is hollywood embraces the "look at me" attitude so much that the whole aesthetic of filmmaking is changing. rather than present a story in a straightforward way that puts the story first, today's directors are getting "experimental" i.e. "look at me".is it me or am i the only one that was really put off by sena's opening minutes of swordfish. that movie went on to rise above sena's directorial attempts at "look at me" filmmaking, unfortunately this short film by mr. ishimoto does not.3 out of 10 rating from elec tv.

comedy is a hard beast to conquer. ishimoto fails on all accounts, as a writer and director. some things, like making movies that are funny, just need to be left to the professionals. 1 out of 10. awful. it wasn't funny. i tried to laugh but it just wasn't funny. i wasn't the only one, no-one else at the chicago festival was laughing either, at least at the showing i saw. simply very bad, sorry :(

anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film. it's interesting they titled it "the hole"! the production values are good for a short film. the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on. i speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat. many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content.my honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. maybe ishimoto's next film will deliver.

this short film doesn't get there. cliche' and not very funny attempt at dark humor. humor isn't funny enough to get you interested and the protagonist isn't likeable so you really don't care about what happens anyway. producer spent some money on this flop and it shows in the production value which is the only saving grace.

really for a short film that looks high budget this is just a candy coated piece of cr*p. it tries so hard to be hollywood. but even hollywood stories have an okay story (sometimes). money wasted on an effort to be hollywood. waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time. for the short film buff, look elsewhere...

well, i like to watch bad horror b-movies, cause i think it's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. (i always compare this movies to - for example - some spielberg's works and again-and-again don't understand the huge difference in what i see.) i like ed wood's movies cause it's so inept it's very funny. but people!!! "the chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable. there's no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. it's extremely inept amateurish film. it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen (and i had seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). i warned you !!! 1/10

"the chilling" directed by deland nuse and jack a.sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen.why linda blair("the exorcist","witchery")appeared in this stinker is beyond me.the plot is really dumb:the frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies.the characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid,the zombies look horrible and there is no gore.avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague.my rating:1 out of 10.

woof! pretty boring, and they might as well have shot it in black and white, it was so colorless.the movie starts with rolling text explaining cryogenics, and asking whether god or satan is behind it. there are some protests outside a cryogenics lab. some people rob a bank, and many of the robbers and guards get shot. the father of one of the robbers (i think) arranges to have his son frozen. there's a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relate.there's a power outage, and the cannisters containing the frozen people get struck by lightning, and they emerge as zombies. they're all wearing silver mylar-like suits, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (no idea why they look so bad - being frozen evidently didn't preserve their looks), and they have silver eyes. they go around killing people, sometimes lurching like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people.linda blair keeps showing up every once in a while, to what purpose i'm not really sure. i think her character works at the cryogenics lab, but she's not very important to the plot, and her role is very small.the movie ends with some freeze frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters next, which are pretty silly.

as to be expected, there's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always-popular premise of zombies and starring the 80's b-movie queen linda blair, namely: it sucks! "the chilling" is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background, whereas it should have just been a light-headed and gore-packed horror flick about frozen zombies. it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens. there's a lot of drivel about cryogenics, which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. so naturally, in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen. needless to say this is extremely boring, until two dim-witted night watchmen decide, during an electric power failure, that it's a good idea to put the metal-constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm. the coolers are struck by lightening, obviously, and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage. "the chilling" is a boring and surprisingly (for a late 80's effort, at least) gore-free horror film that doesn't even use up a quarter of its potential. all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and i can't think of any reason why the zombie-attacks had to be so bloodless. even in spite of the low budget available, they could have done better. the set pieces, make-up effects and costumes are pitiable. the research lab, for example, looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldn't look less menacing with their green faces and foil-wrapped outfits. how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low-budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery. she's attracted to lousy b-movies like bees are to honey.

i'm all about the walking dead, but my mind is still unsure of the walking, frozen dead. sadly, the chilling didn't help me make up my mind. this is really slow with nothing happening for the first 45 minutes, making me hit the "film enhancement" button several times. by the time the well designed zombies show up, it is too late and the director (two are rumored to have filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. haggerty, blair and donahue all look tired/embarrassed/recovering in some fashion. i will give the film credit as it predates the t2 ending with villains being frozen by liquid nitrogen. the shriek show dvd offers an extended promo reel from back in the day that runs 8 minutes long and i would actually recommend that over watching the flick in its entirety.

poor second-string feature from universal pictures about a mama's boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military, fending off the advances of the brash young woman he's been assigned to romance. robert montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story "come be my love", and his acting performances of this era are unrelievedly lazy. the plot is sappy, predictable stuff, and writer robert carson has given all the really funny lines (as usual for films of this period) to the feisty black maid. it's always nice to see ann blyth and jane cowl in support, but they can't do much with this hokey material. * from ****

after the turning point of night must fall, robert montgomery (for the most time) came into his finest films and performances: here comes mr. jordan, they were expendable, the lady in the lake, ride the pink horse, the saxon charm, june bride. even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable (rage in heaven, mr. and mrs. smith). but montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work. in 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played collier lang, an egotistical movie star, who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend.apparently my view of this film is a minority view. most of the views given are favorable about it. i thought it was a dull, witless script, with ann blyth's groupie heroine not very appealing as a character. she admires montgomery as a star, and this "helps" when he is called in to assist the authorities, but after awhile i found there was no chemistry between them. the script was also devoid of much fun, although montgomery and roland winters did try. the only thing i recall to this day as a joke point was that taylor holmes is the wealthy father of blyth, and he is an admirer of winston churchill. so he always dresses up as churchill, and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat, smoking a large cigar, and painting (holmes' bald head helps in the disguise). that was the most memorable joke from this film - not much of a real memory.montgomery went into early television, and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures. his last contact with the movies was his direction of the gallant hours about admiral william "bull" halsey, starring his friend jimmy cagney. it is a far better film than this. for his overall film and television career, i will give this mediocre film a "4". that strikes me as generous.

greyfriars bobby was not a westie - bobby was a skye terrier. a highlight of my childhood day trips to edinburgh was to go to the monument to bobby. i grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog, as every child in my generation did, and i remember lining up with my mum outside the cinema - with many, many other dundee children and their mums - to see the wonderful disney film. how could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a westie, for heaven's sake. that's like making a movie about the life of robert burns, for instance, and portraying him as an englishman. i say,give bobby back his breed!

but like the disney film of two generations ago, this film fails as well in the accuracy department. but at least disney used a skye terrier.is the true story to mundane for movie producers? i don't think so. there is ample documentation to accurately portray they true story instead of the fictionalized accounts we have had to suffer through. some day, a movie will correctly portray bobby's owner, john gray, as the edinburgh policeman that he was, and correctly portray bobby's license a being paid for by the lord provost. when that happens, i'll be at the theaters.

they have taken a story dear to the people of edinburgh's heart, a true story and changed it as hollywood has done before to many a tale. the end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate. the original movie of this tale that walt disney himself oversaw used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that john grey was anything special he was a poor shepard who died in poverty at the inn. if you like the story, watch the disney original for a better heart- warming story. it's a shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale. read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story. and if you really like it, you can visit the real kirkyard in edinburgh.

like another user i got this cheap - i thought. 85 kroners (£8). although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i - like the other users - first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some 20 years after. the story is amazingly thin (which is why it might have worked for kids), but all the radio language and trucker stuff makes up for it. it'll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come. first viewing (1980): 10/10. second viewing (2002): 4/10

the plot: a trucker (kristofferson) battles a corrupt sheriff (borgnine) by getting his fellow truckers to band together and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy.the negative: the film's setup is weak and the ending even weaker. it has all the good-ole-boy/trucker clichés without adding anything new in the process. it ends up making smokey and the bandit look brilliant and inspired. kristofferson is much too laid back for a leading man role and cannot carry the picture. borgnine's character is portrayed awkwardly. at the start he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overacts to a minor contrivance that starts the whole thing rolling. then at the end he is made out to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly siding with kristofferson, which doesn't work at all. in either case jackie gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. the worst part about the movie though is director peckinpah's attempts to throw in a 'serious message' into this silly action flick that does nothing but slow it down and bomb in the process.the positive: the only good scene in the whole film is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant. director peckinpah puts a funny spin to his trademark 'slow motion' violence and the result is amusing. unfortunately he starts putting all the action into slow motion during the rest of the picture until it eventually becomes tiring. mcgraw is always a pleasure to look at, but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do.the lowdown: if you've read the synopsis than you have essentially 'seen' the movie. the song that this movie is based on is pretty good, but the movie adds nothing to it and should never have been made. this is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick director.the rating: 3 out of 10.

this film goes into my "worst films ever made" file. i have a copy of this film which i watch when i want a good laugh, and this isn't even a comedy. i am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. this film is inaccurate (in its portrayal of hockey), offensive (to canadians), and i wasn't even all that impressed with the acting. even the story was a bit weak. if you have never seen this film, you're lucky. if you have, i'm sorry.

the game of hockey i play and watch has something called "speed" which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing. add to that a storyline that is cliché, predictable and stupider than stupid with some of the lamest '80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have "youngblood". oh, keanu as a french canadian, yeah, whatever. gimme dunlop, braden and the hansons anytime... one out of ten.

another awful movie about hockey. i if never watched hockey and saw hollywoods version, i would hate the game. this movie doesn't make canada look that great either. i can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. all the same this movie is awful, with every thing you can put in a 80's movie. in the end don't even watch it on tv. 4/10

less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history. this is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the caribbean to the trading houses of london.....hmm, that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling, pillaging, ripper of a movie doesn't it? well it's not. tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece. out of 20th century fox, anne of the indies is adapted by philip dunne & arthur caesar from a short story written by herbert ravenel sass. direction is by jacques tourneur, the score is by franz waxman and harry jackson is providing the technicolor photography. jean peters is in the titular title role of anne {aka captain providence} and support comes from louis jourdan, debra paget, herbert marshall, thomas gomez & james robertson justice.originally meant to be be based on true life pirate anne bonny, the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity, and finding herself, in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring. peters gives it a right good go, and paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. while robertson justice, although underused, actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does. some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it's tourneur in the directing chair. but there is no depth here, this is merely a job for tourneur, a professional one granted, but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes. disposable at best. 4/10

give me a break. how can anyone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? i know that movies tend to do a pretty p***-poor job of portraying hockey to the general public. and yes, this was made back when the u.s. hadn't embraced our sport to the extent is has today, but really. i have played hockey all my life and have watched even more, and this my friends is sheer lunacy. the scenes on the ice were stupefyingly bizzare... the particular instance to which i am referring is the "sword fight", er i mean the "stick fight" at the end of the film... during which everyone is just standing around and watching, not with fascination that this is actually happening, but in wonder as to who will win the duel between youngblood and his nemesis rakkie. yes the story off the ice is a little better, i do stress little.i don't know, maybe there is no point in going on... i mean let's face it: the film is right. hockey is just one big battle on ice... oh yeah with a little piece of vulcanized rubber bouncing around- occasionally into what is loosely termed a "goal". youngblood is either appalling or hysterical, i can't figure out which... maybe someone else will have more luck.

i should know better. i've seen too many of rob lowe's early work to expect anything good from this movie, even if it is about hockey.here we have, yet again, another tired sports theme. kid has potential for greatness, has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn't screw things up. and, boom, he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion. is that all that can be said of sports movies? surely, there must be other feats that athletes undertake.nonetheless, this movie has got to be one of the biggest cheeseballs. everybody's interactions are just downright silly, and not in a stupid-funny kind of manner. and i can't think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position. not the actors (certainly not swayze who plays lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music, and very little from the skating sequences. normally, i'm a sucker for 80s movies, even if they do tend to be a little fishy (i.e. north shore, the karate kid), but this doesn't even make for good 80s trash. for a good 80s sports movie, check elsewhere. there's plenty of them out there.

this movie is terrible. a true hockey fan would have to assume that the people that appeared in and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game. i got this hoping that it would be a "guy movie", but the only people that would probably enjoy this movie are females between the ages of 13-17. the hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc. it's so difficult to predict the end of this movie, though!! for those who have seen it, who would have guessed?? for those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!i figured it out less than halfway through the movie. to call this movie a drama is ridiculous!!

"speck" was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck. there is, however, not much killing to be found in this movie, and none of it is explicitly shown. the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub, yet even this is merely implied, and not shown, save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr. speck's leg. the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voice-over, which should be a testament to the mind-numbingly boring nature of this movie. every aspect of this movie is horrible. unless you have a fondness for boredom, don't bother. this movie only clocks in at 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.

where to start with 'speck' the true story of richard speck, a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s. director keith walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies (such as birth rite) and here works from a script by (at the time) full moon regular don adams. unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn't great, perhaps because the real speck's ramblings were not terribly interesting!? despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period (such as 'ed gein'). filmed in a dirty brown, not quite sepia, for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating, the colouring distracting from the story and the crime, though gruesome and upsetting to watch, is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events. there is no examination of the motivation or of speck's life really, just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime. released by full moon there is little evidence of full moon's better output here, charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings (e.g. dolls, monsters and so on) and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality. incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called 'shadow entertainment'. band has said that he regrets the period of full moon output alongside tempe entertainment (whose creator j.r. bookwalter and regular danny draven also speak very badly of charles band). the tempe era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal hand-held camera filming, very much like a home movie. speck retains these qualities and whereas witchouse 3, for example, managed to use these well, speck is merely boring and gross.

i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely, i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story. while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors. 1. speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie. in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. 2. the asian nurse who survived speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. this would have been impossible. in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims. 3. the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. not true. in reality speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them. this is how he was able to tie each of them up. 4. the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be. fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why. speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying, the voice over would be laughable. all in all, doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence. no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known, after all, for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them. beverly ann sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film. she is a very good actress. if you are at all squeamish, do not see this film. it's very graphic and disturbing.

rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck - that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review.it's a movie about the serial killer richard speck, who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties. watching the movie, one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. unfortunately, that doesn't make for a good movie.another problem i had was the near-constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie, and some god-awful narration letting us know what's motivating speck. the acting was average for this type of film; to give credit where credit is due, the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste. your mileage may vary.over all, if you're interested in the subject matter, it may be worth your time.

after matt dillon's phenomenal performance in crash, most will probably rush to pick up a copy of factotum to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script.well, factotum certainly has its moments, but the plainness of ...everything will most likely turn viewers off. however nothing should be taken away from dillon. his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor, proving he's a solid actor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script.the story is about henry "hank" chinaski (dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. he quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes, only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me).skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to jan (lili taylor, the haunting), a loser girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself, hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him. whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation. some may say that he never does, while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity.regardless, there's not much substance to factotum even with matt dillon's fine performance. the story meanders through hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. and that's a shame. dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script.

some twenty or so years ago, charles bukowski was a hero of mine. i blindly accepted the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films. of course, i never got to meet the intellectual types that prescribed bukowski as a hero. they usually could be found safely behind the counter at hipster video stores and record shops. these people hardly talked and when asked a question, usually sneered and nodded in some vague direction. they were useless when it came to locating a specific title, but their shelves were always stocked with strange and unique titles. to be inducted in the secret hipster club, i believed i had to shed my bourgeois up-bringing and espouse the counter-culture.my introduction to bukowski started with the movie barfly, the late 80's film that starred mickey rourke and faye dunnaway. i was a fan of rourke at the time. he also embodied a sort of modern male fantastical anti-hero, a brooding intellectual type. at the time, this appealed to me. barfly's hero scoffed at convention. a mid-30's tramp, who lives life with no ties, answers to no one, --oh--and to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob, icing on the cake. afterwards, i read post-office and hollywood, the later being bukowski's take on his experience with the film.now, allow me to fast-forward to the latest film based on bukowski's book factotum, one which i read and enjoyed. bukowski takes the form of chinaski in this novel. i often wonder where bukowski ended and chinaski began. 20 years after barfly, the fictional movie bukowski is still the same. i have watched about an hour of the movie and i have yet to see signs of the facade cracking. here is why factotum bukowski was my hero. chinaski is handsome (played by matt dillon). he has clean neat hair, styled, but not over the top. when dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. chinaski goes from job to job, ignoring and/or fighting with various bosses. he screws two floozies, one of whom he lives with, walks out on, only to return to with little repercussion. chinaski is his own man and we never see him emote. he's a sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something, james dean archetype. factotum lies to the viewer. it does so by haranguing the idea of a man (a writer) without consequence. a poor man, who's suffering for his art. what could be cooler than that? now, let's say there are some truths to factotum, in that the events took place. what the audience is missing is the pain that shrouds chinaski's existence. maybe the point of this movie, and most movies, is that for 80 mins., we need to escape the world that's filled with consequence and pain and take-up vicariously with an anti-social womanizer, that smokes, talks, drinks with detached coolness. one who rejects conventional behavior of job and family. my hero used to be movie bukowski. long ago, that would have worked. it was easier then. now, i have yet to claim a hero. things are not as easy. hipster logic and movie renditions of counter-culture icons offer no solutions or even ask questions.

a boring movie about a miserable loser...that's factotum in a nutshell. matt dillon plays henry chinaski, alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based. as we meet chinaski he may be a writer but he's certainly not a successful one. he floats through life, getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit. the fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with his not caring. he meets a woman, jan, played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues. chinaski moves into jan's apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else. good times. eventually he's had enough of this relationship so chinaski strikes out on his own. unfortunately he still can't hold down a job so soon enough he's broke. at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character, laura, decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesn't even know. we soon meet some of laura's acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch. soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again we're left with chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life. there's some more time spent with jan but mostly there's just time spent being a drunk, unemployable loser. and then the movie's over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on. nothing happens. nothing ever happens. if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you. if you're looking for a compelling story, well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you've come to the wrong place. dillon's performance actually isn't bad at all. too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad.

acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in "screaming teen" cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing. in some ways acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably.overall acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of cabin fever, texas chainsaw massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance. the characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. in the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.as the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. this was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché, which i suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which i found intriguing. this, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.technically the film has a lot of problems however. the cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, i find rather sophomoric and over-stylized, utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly. many transitions i felt were also over-stylized. the use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.the plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.if the film were better executed, it would have been excellent. however, acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.

alien was excellent. many writers tried to copy it. they all did a bad job (or almost). but dead space is the worst alien copy. because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the bad scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. the movie wasn't very long and this is a very good thing (the only one). you cannot laugh because it is too serious...that is a bad thing because, in almost each b-series sci-fi film, you can laugh during the whole time. it can be terrific sometimes, but instead of watching this stupidity, just watch alien or event horizon...these are much better!!! i give it 1 out of 5.

doesn't mean this movie is good. i was really frustrated by it on many levels. it's kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski. hey, i've read that guy in college--let's see what matt dillon does with him. and i like matt dillon. i thought he came close to looking a little like hank, but mostly just the ruddy cheeks. i have to care about a character, though, and there just wasn't much here to care about. i think time might be cruel to bukowski, and that bothers me a lot, because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time. hard to sit through, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. i ask for very little, got less.

this movie has some good lines, but watching dillon's less-than-masterful rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original. i like marisa tomei but she's no faye dunaway.also, in my opinion, the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about. you might not love the character, but you should care what happens to him. this is achieved in barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender. the main fight in factotum is when, completely unprovoked, he stalks up to the lily taylor character in a bar, punches her to the floor and calls her a whore.the whole thing just didn't work. again, some great lines -- some laugh-out-loud funny -- but as a movie overall it's a fail. mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant, and you can't get past that. next? let's remake breakfast at tiffany's with kate hudson.

clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowski's work. the autobiographical henry chinaski character in bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987's 'barfly', also starring faye dunaway. anyone who has seen 'factotum' should certainly see 'barfly' to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character. 'factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero. the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood-soaked rourke. rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a place-setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer. dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting, handsome, relatively clean-looking wanna-be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of chinaski's story. dunaway's sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well henry. the women in 'factotum' can't hold a candle to dunaway's 'distressed goddess' and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in 'factotum' proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships. i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'factotum' (marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip-off from 'barfly').if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film, see 'barfly' and 'love is a dog from hell' (which also goes by the title 'crazy love').

i have waited a long time to see this movie. ifc finally ran it one night. i thought it would be something like "barfly" from barbet schroeder. wrong. this film doesn't recreate that underworld of chintzy, dirty, smoke filled, character filled bars you associate with his stories. it also fails to capture that bukowski attitude that mickey rourke did so well in the above mentioned film. that natural smart-ass attitude. fans of charles bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen but those unfamiliar with his books could get the wrong impression about his works. this film looks like just another 'movie of the week" about a drunk and his relationships. if you want to get a better idea about charles bukowski's world watch "barfly".

in los angeles, the alcoholic and lazy hank chinaski (matt dillon) performs a wide range of non-qualified functions just to get enough money to drink and gamble in horse races. his primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women."factotum" is an uninteresting, pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble, being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior. in accordance with imdb, this character would be the fictional alter-ego of the author charles bukowski, and based on this story, i will certainly never read any of his novels. honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, better off watching the touching and heartbreaking hector babenco's "ironweed" or marco ferreri's "storie di ordinaria follia" that is based on the life of the same writer. my vote is four.title (brazil): "factotum  sem destino" ("factotum  without destiny")

perry mason: the case of the glass coffin finds raymond burr defending david copperfield/rick blaine like magician peter scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. a trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of nancy grahn comes a tumbling out.nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. first in a moment of drunken weakness, scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past.billy moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in grahn's home town. a little more action than usual for ken malansky, he almost gets himself killed. one big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. the medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that scolari could not possibly have done the deed. the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer. when you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how the investigating officer james mceachin got it wrong from the start. it kind of spoils this particular mason film.

the idea behind this movie was great. the story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog. the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. also, there is very tedious, almost funny, overuse of metaphors in the voice overs. the high point is the acting of the little girl. nice try, but this one's a stinker.

an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script, inept direction, and some of the worst score that i have ever heard. more tv movie of the week than serious drama. which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real. the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character, it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring. in my opinion, one the most blatant forms of cut and paste film adapting.

i would have given this movie a 1, but i laughed so hard, so many times, that i had to give it a little credit, in the off off off off chance the film was supposed to be funny. a movie so bad you'll think chimps wrote it. you'll wish chimps had written it. dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. the movie exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the original carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. like intersplicing scenes from taxi driver into baby geniuses. do not rent it alone, as you will not enjoy the experience. you will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing. worst actress of the millenium goes to poor poor amy irving as the stone-faced, monotone, disastrously wooden school counselor. worst movie of the year so far (see also _arlington road_). --frink-3

be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving "over sexed jocks". there isn't a thing redeeming about carrie 2. the plot is absurd, the acting terrible, and the ending all too predictable.i wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but i was expecting to be entertained. i wasn't. the only way i could rationalize watching this movie was because i was at a relative's house while waiting for my car to be fixed. unless in the same predicament stay well away from this film.

i am the kind of person who can enjoy a good b movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it, but dead space has nothing to redeem it! this is the kind of film that will make you frustrated, restless and sick to your stomach. bad acting. lame story. terrible effects. horrible, excruciating dialogue. dead space has it all!

the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie. the acting was poor and the premise of sexual scorecards was revolting. the effects were marginal at best. there were no stand out performances, amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween h20 audience. the original was much more enjoyable and gratifying. i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years 10 best...so far it is at the bottom of my list. don't bother with this one folks!!

i thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had. this is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week. the original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel. one good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly, because the plot seemed rushed. when rachel's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. another bring down was the involvement of amy irving. all her scenes brought down the movies pace. the dialog in this movie was terrible. it in no way reflected the way kids talk. in conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene.

if this awful film moved at a snails pace it would at least be moving.watching grass grow would be more interesting. it was painful to sit through and i only stayed in the theatre to see how all the cruel teens would die.where is brian depalma????

following up the 1970s classic horror film carrie with this offering, is like ford following the mustang with the edsel. this film was horrendous in every detail. it would have been titled beverly hill 90210 meets mystery science theater 3000, but both of those shows far exceed this tripe. this film was scarcely a horror film. i timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of lame high school hazing and ritual. wow, what a surprise, carrie's weird friend commits suicide! wow, carrie misconstrues her love interests affections! wow, the in-crowd sets up carrie! wow, the jocks have a sexual scoring contest! what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches. this film is totally unviewable.

ok, i did think that it would be horrible. but when i saw it.. i was proven wrong. emily bergl did a superb job as did jason london. sue snell was under-used and under-written. the meanies were ok, dylan bruno and rachel blanchard are definitely the stand-outs. as for the things the teens do and how people claim it's all wrong. whatever. my friends and i use the term "swank" a lot and i have driven a car and had someone steer as i changed. it's pretty much all there. i've just never been at a after-game party in a house that big with it's very own light show.. the deaths are good. the best involves a pair of glasses, a spear gun and a pool.. all in that order. i must say, there will be people who hate it.. but i'm not one of them.

this movie started with some promise: big name cast, good looking sets, but then it fell apart.most of the time it can't tell whether it's a serious movie or a comedy. one minute they're talking about how there's no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banter.some of the acting is pretty bad, mainly from patrick swayze and piper perabo. she also gets some groaner lines like, "when i marry, it will be about love." ugh.but the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much of anything really. just a lot of clichés and cheesy moments.also, a movie with "dragon" in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few (and pathetic cgi dragons) that appeared in this movie.can't the scifi channel show *any* good movies?

all but the youngest americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of "laaaaaa-sie!" from little timmy, or whatever the kid's name was, wailing his little tow-head off for his border collie friend. these same americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that lassie made the leap from television to movies (or was it the other way around? i'm clearly too lazy to do any research here), and the painted hills is one of those. it is irresistible to make a "this movie has gone to the dogs!" pun, so i won't (even though i technically just did). but in a way, it has. lassie (playing shep, man's best friend) gets top billing. the dog gets top billing. now, i'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how it plays out in my mind: movie mogul: okay, lassie, in the credits, it's gonna be, "and with lassie as shep!" lassie: rrrrowf! grrrrrrr. movie mogul: ha, ha, kid, calm down, calm down! lassie: rrroo rrrrooo roooo. movie mogul: okay, i think i see. co-lead billing? lassie: rawrf! rawrrrrff rawrf! movie mogul: oh god! let go of my arm! top billing! top billing for you, now let go of my arm!!! so, the dog gets top billing, and with the rest of this shell-shocked cast, i suppose it's understandable. we get lovable old grumpus jonathan the prospector, his young, whiny and apparently orphaned friend tommy, sketchy loser lin taylor, and lovable old religious grumpus pilot pete. the meat of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences, so i'll save you the actual pain of watching the movie. jonathan is a prospector with a dog named shep, and his partner dies while he is at his claim. he gets a new partner named lin who becomes obsessed with the gold, and jonathan for some reason gives shep to whiny little crybaby tommy. lin kills jonathan, shep sees it, and lin tries to kill shep. then lin tries to kill tommy. then tommy whines, it gets cold, and shep carries out an elaborate plan to get revenge on lin, which he (or she?) does. the end.unless you have a deep, unsettling need to see a lassie movie (even then, there's got to be a better lassie movie than this), just avoid the painted hills. when it's not dragging on, marveling at lassie's limited ability to 'act' (similar in style, perhaps, to keanu reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves), setting up the obvious using several minutes of film, or insulting native americans everywhere with its white-actor-in-facepaint "ugh! how! me running bear!" stereotypes, the painted hills is fit only for lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection to prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin' fer that consarned vein of glittery gold!

pretty bad. this film about a grizzled(and frankly rock stupid) old prospector and his dog'shep' i.e., lassie, as well as an annoying kid whose name i can't recall at the moment. at the beginning of the movie, the old prospector has deliberately buried himself in some sand so that the poor dog will have to dig him out. why? did he hate the dog? anyhoo, somehow or other this idiot has managed to strike gold, and goes to tell his partner. but the man has died, and his sleazy other partner is happy to assist old jonathan in digging up the gold. the geezer tries to leave is dog with the dead guy's son, but not even the retarded mutt wants to stay with this kid. there's quaint old preacher(for quaint read smelly), and the oily guy finished off the old guy(surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. plus he poisons the dog and tries to kill the kid, too. so i suppose its okay that a devilish and crazy lassie..err...shep does this the guy in at the end, although its pretty disturbing in what is basically a children's movie. there are extremely stereotypical(to the point of racial slur) 'native americans' who speak without using verbs(as in, me make camp fire type speech). and that's pretty much the extent of the cast, because apparently lassie's salary was too big for them to hire anyone else. kind of dull. not very interesting, and a tad too dark. not a great movie in any way.

a lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... forever. that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film. so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen. it isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie. the idea of lassie turning bad is intriguing but so little actually happens, and so slowly, that you feel your life slipping away while sitting there, watching the non-actors read their lines off cue cards waiting for their measly paychecks.it's an empty, hollow shell of a movie. seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on. unless you're both heavily medicated. that's all i have to say.avoid, avoid, avoid! it will drive you barking mad! hahahah, get it? barking! hahahahahahaha! sorry, i've had a rough week.

like its near contemporaries "the great race" and "those magnificent men in their flying machines", i always associate this film with my childhood especially at new year. on new year's day we'd visit my granny and after lunch, while the adults talked, the kids would watch tv where invariably one of these three crazy race films would be on.for that reason alone, i really wanted to mark "monte carlo or bust" well but i fear i can't, the child not being father to the man on this occasion. by which i mean i can see all too clearly its faults and while i was tempted to smile occasionally, in truth i really wanted all the competitors to get to the end of the race long before they actually do.of course it's dated by its stereotyping of nationalities and woman as the weaker sex and i also didn't much care for one or two stray, admittedly mild vulgarities which occasionally surfaced. more than that though, the cast, despite hamming it up outrageously just don't sell the film enough. tony curtis, in a trial run for his "yank abroad" turn in the tv series "the persuaders", seems too old to be playing the young gallant, terry thomas just isn't dastardly enough, eric sykes is unbelievable as a dirty-minded lothario while gert frobe as an overdone teuton, is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was bond's best villain goldfinger. if anything the englishers come off best - susan hampshire is at least engaging as a "bright young thing", suitably gamine as a posh flapper and although chained to the leash of the script pete and dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types, although even then the "carry on" team did this so much better in "carry on up the khyber pass".director annakin tries everything to evoke the "golden silents", with lashings of slapstick, mistaken identity capers, speeded up camera shots, would-be dramatic stunts and some light romance, but there's no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race-off at the end seems like another swizz.actually i'd have given it another mark if they'd stuck to the alternative title "those magnificent men in their jaunty jalopies" but in truth the animated series "wacky races" did this so much better.

i agree with jessica, this movie is pretty bad. i'm surprised anyone took it seriously. characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. the only merit here is that it's so lame it's funny. actually for me, there is the added benefit that it was shot in a state park not far from where i live, so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a hoot.the lead character is a off-duty cop, and makes a big point of lecturing a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea, it's against the law. imagine how long that lasts ...most of the movie's northern california characters are blown-dried hollywood cheese-balls, looking like they've never actually been in a fight. the story line is totally predictable. this film is ripe for a mst-3k lampooning. camp value only. i'm pretty forgiving of films in general, but seeing the old positive reviews i had to speak up. this is a dog. i give it a 3 out of 10, and then only for laughs.

i have to say that i had low expectations for the movie before viewing it. all the people around said it was great, but i perfectly knew what they like. they like aerosmith's song which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one, failed and now he is nothing. and all these things plus the reviews and the ratings i read in internet, gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since i am a big disaster kind of movies fan. well, i've been right, but at least i was prepared.the movie is really commercial. it's been said, but i will say it as again. we have over #100 million budget, we have a romance between hollywood stars ben affleck and liv tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen. such as billy bob thornton and steve buscemi which are highly respected actors that i also like a lot. they could play many characters in many different kind of movies. they could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. on the whole, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and will always love. such as fargo in buscemi's case or a simple plan - thornton. and to be honest, i am really disappointed they took part of armageddon. thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if i remember correctly. buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world.what i didn't like - well, i guess i've been already understood. i pointed out bad factors. the story is dull, artless and silly. it is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous. at least movies like deep impact and godzilla have something special that might be considered as art. at least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes. other than that, bad performances from all the huge stars. the jokes ain't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes, they doesn't make sense at all. in fact, i recently read that on the stage, ben affleck has asked bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill, than drillers to becomes astronauts and bay's reply has been simply "shut up!" which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creators's desperation.and enclosing, i'll give an explanation why i give 4 to the movie. well, i like "don't want to miss a thing" and i was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie. the first scene is memorable. these are the the only 2 good things i liked about the movie. michael bay is an average director, but the rock and both bad boys were hundreds of times better than armageddon which was, is and will always be one big bad movie.

this 'schlock-buster' should carry a government health warning. if you play it in your dvd machine, you are in serious risk of opening a rift in the space-time continuum and disappearing without trace into it - so bad is this 'movie'.the fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern hollywood cinema, and the continual commissioning of films that appeal to the 'lowest common denominator' - although i truly dread to think of the 'lowest common denominators' that this film actually appeals to!!i think hollywood were just conducting some kind of proving trials when they made and screened this film! i can imagine the executive boardroom meetings at the studio ... "just how bad a film can we actually get away with making - and still make loads of money!??! holy cow, i didn't realise we could go that bad!! woooo hooooo!!"the only films worse than this that i can think of (and trust me it is close) are die another day (rip the bond franchise as i knew it) and independence day!avoid - avoid - avoid!!!!

i watched this movie about six years ago and i recently did so again. if i remember correctly i did not like it at all the first time and i appreciated it slightly more this second time.this movie is obviously on a big budget. the effects are mostly top notch (except for one or two "impacts") and the cast is impressive. however, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show.firstly, whoever decided that peter stormare should act as a crazy russian astronaut should be fired. being a swede and a fan of peter, i'm pretty sure he can play a russian character well. but his performance in this case is plain stupid, both with respect the lines uttered and the acting. so... something must be wrong with the script. i'd like to see peter as a professional russian astronaut instead.secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch. it is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath. in addition to this, the events that unfold are simply not credible. i'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie.finally, the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action-biased. the shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of migs, at zero safety distance, while bouncing off car-sized ice blocks like ping-pong balls. the director should watch apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like these.i like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching. the overall performance of the actors is great. apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to follow.with some minor changes this would have been a 8/10 movie. i'm sorry it isn't!

dear readers,i've found in my studies of movies that whenever michael bay makes a movie, people pan it and hate it, yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around 100 million dollars. why? because michael bay is one of the top five directors of all time. standing alongside ridley scott, spielberg, kubrick, and miyazaki, michael bay has cemented himself as hollywood's best action/adventure director. that point is proved with his most panned film, armageddon.an asteroid the size of texas is hurtling towards the planet and the only way nasa can think to take it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid, drill to its core, and drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid. only one person is qualified enough to do it: bruce willis. willis portrays harry stamper, a grizzled hardened oil driller trying to keep what's left of his family together. not helping that fact is his daughter, grace (liv tyler), having an affair with his best driller, aj (ben affleck). hired by dan truman (billy bob thornton), the head of nasa, stamper and his team of roughneck drillers train to become astronauts and save the world.armageddon is a two part movie. first there's the funny parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds. then they get into space and all the comedy gets sucked out the window and is replaced by mind-blowing special effects, cool music, and great serious acting. murphy's law goes insane in the second part, meaning that everything that can go wrong, does in fact go wrong, increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels.with a cool cast and crew (michael bay as director, jerry bruckheimer and gale anne hurd as producers, and j.j. abrams as one of the scriptwriters.), tons of special effects, great humor, awesome music, plus an intro done by mr. ben-hur himself, charlton heston, armageddon rocks big time.signed, the constant dvd collector, matt macleodparental warnings: this is not a film for kids. the f-bomb is used a few times and lots of other swear words are used as well, plus there's a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part might be too hard for a kid to handle.

being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and utterly unbelievable in every way. the pace is constantly fever-pitched, and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria. it is nigh unwatchable, and a stain - nay, a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved.the wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go "come on!" all the time. the setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously. i can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10.if you want to see a good asteroid movie, see deep impact, which is intense, sensitive and thoroughly engrossing. everything armageddon is not.

the acting was horrible. the special effects, while exceptional, dominated the movie. the writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was unbelievable. and the silly little love story between liv tyler and ben affleck was out of place.but the worst offense of "armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "the asteroid is the size of texas," says billy bob thornton. er, that's 800 miles wide! no one in nasa even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in new york? suuuuure. nasa hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week? yeah, right. someone brings a sidearm on the space shuttle with them? yeah, that's realistic. and bruce willis blows up the asteroid with three seconds to spare. how disney-esque!how bad was this movie? i rooted for the asteroid!

two movies: "the fifth element", "armageddon". the same subject: to save the world. the same main actor: bruce willis. one difference: "armageddon" is very inferior to luc besson's film. some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay. several parts of the movie are showing it. i think about the president's speech and especially willis' relationship with his daughter, "grace". at the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. then, at the end of the movie, it's true love and understanding that shine in him. on another hand, the movie falls in the following trap: michael bay takes his subject too seriously. of course, the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the "fifth element", the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. the movie suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into the ridiculous (the russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are bad used. bruce willis is all the contrary of his "fifth element"'s character. he plays the he-man, he hams it up and sometimes, he's unbearable. the other actors are barely credible in their own roles, particularly, willis' sinking crew. it seems that this crew is here just for having fun. one of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool. and poor liv tyler! she's at the nasa just to be decorative.when the movie was released in france in august 1998, bruce willis expressed is weariness of saving the world. his weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.

this movie has bad writing and bad editing. it is difficult to follow what is going on because nothing any of the characters do makes much sense. some major calamity occurs every 30 seconds. as a result, none of the "action" sequences are at all interesting. the movie is two hours worth of "throw away" scenes which are connected merely by the fact that they share common actors. this movie doesn't even have enough of a sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.

i can't remember when i've seen a worse movie. the acting was overwrought, the dialog trite to the point of being painful to listen to, the special effects second-rate and the overall story laughable.i've never wanted to walk out on a movie more, and if i'd been alone that's what i'd have done, about 30 minutes into it, and saved myself nearly another two excruciating hours of nausea-inducing dialog and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese "the size of texas." i just can't overemphasize what a miserable experience sitting through this collosal waste of perfectly good celluloid was.

i used to like some of the hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. they had icons such as arnie and sly but i think the action movie in the '90s has plummeted to new depths. the worst of these, i believe, was armageddon.the plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. the melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for bruce willis to disappear from the screen. liv tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as bernardo bertolucci and robert altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. this movie symbolises the new hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. that is the norm these days and i begin to wonder if there is a role in hollywood for screenwriters. it seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. the rest they leave to technology. there is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in armageddon. it just feels empty and bland. i can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves liv tyler's dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film. steven tyler's band aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.i weep for western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. it stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. i would even prefer to watch the eighth friday the 13th.

first of all. i do not look down on americans. i know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa. but this movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it.first of all...movies are mostly far from the truth. this movie is no exception. lots of scene's are so incredibly false. for example the departure of the 2 space ships. you see them drop off the full tanks in space. just a small distance from each other. remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? just a tinsy winsy part that came off. in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. what idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? second of it is that the russian station is a piece of (s)crap. i hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to russia. since their equipment is much more reliable then nasa's. the space shuttle is retired. and nasa uses it just to pay off the bills. and there is no better alternative for it. and the list of whoppers goes on and on. this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. and i know half as much as these guys do. but the most annoying part ( read: the whole movie ) is the propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. my god !!!! i thought i was looking at a cnn business commercial for like an hour. the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... but when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? maybe i lack the feeling of being a true "patriot", that can sing the national anthem backwards in swahili. whilst riding with george bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. but this movie was too much for me too handle. and when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my hiney. i realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. i do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. but i pity them. this represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. as long as "uncle sam" thinks you are a good patriot. where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares.

like many people in my general age range, i remember going to see this movie as a kid in '98 and coming out of the theatre practically in tears. it seemed, at the time, to be one of the most important, awe-inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation. at once riveting, action-packed, funny, heartbreaking, and truly inspirational, armegeddeon really did have everything going on, right down to the catchy aerosmith theme song and sappy tear-jerker of an ending.sweet jebus. what were we smoking? i watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels, and... i cannot even describe it. this is, truly, one of the worst movies ever made. where to even begin? leaving aside the plethora of laughable scientific errors ('personnel trackers' on astronauts? yeah, sure, thanks for that, billy bob), i'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable - dare i even say unmatched - way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting. there are too many examples of this to even begin listing here, but one in particular springs to mind - the scene where bruce willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to track down each of the oh-so-charmingly-roguish members of his oil drilling team ('check every bar in new orleans', 'the craps tables in vegas', 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in sturgis'... all to the tune of 'come together'... it reminded me a bit of the "news team! assemble!" scene from anchorman, except serious). ben affleck proves, once again, that he is by far the most overpaid actor in hollywood, having less depth, range, and overall talent than anyone else in the business. not that bruce willis, liv tyler, or anyone else in this godforsaken piece of garbage was much better.(i have to say, though, i got a kick out of seeing a pre-stardom owen wilson get killed off half-way through... is this the only movie where his character dies?) peter stormare is perfect as the most stereotypical unshaven russian cosmonaut you have ever scene. (then again, peter stormare does seem to have a talent for playing over-the-top eurotypes.) it really was quite amusing how, almost immediately after the americans dock with the russian space station (which is actually called that in the movie), ben affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular hollywood fashion. i also love the fact that, in the end, paris is the only place on earth to get destroyed, and that absolutely no one seems to care. and on top of all that, it at points literally turns into simultaneous ads for lockheed martin and kerr mcgee. oh how proud i am to be an american.there's plenty of other stuff to rant about, but i won't... suffice it to say that this is a really, really, really terrible movie, that i feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked.i give it two stars just for the mockability factor.

i remember thinking that due to the cast, the subject matter, and the director, i was going to love this movie.stepping into the theatre and taking my seat, i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built.i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie.if you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. i'm not going to give away anything really important, but it might be seen as such, so that is the warning.spoiler may be included below, beware.i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene. i mean honestly, refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning, and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode.while all of this is possible, it seemed to me to be way over the top. i'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting, the silly view of the russian technology, or just the campy attitude of the scene itself.it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space...you know, that place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum.but the coup de grace for me, honestly, was the gun scene. (spoiler possibility) - earlier in the movie, we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle (the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill) when he is told that this is what they will be using. he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what's on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing.so then, as we are wandering onto the asteroids, we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles...you know, standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case, you know, aliens or something.i could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the silly russian space station refueling scene, the cheesy love scene near the end, the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters, but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicle's gun all over the place and causing havoc/damage, well that threw the entire thing over the top for me.save your money and time and avoid this movie. if you want a good meteor movie, see deep impact, if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects, see space cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this flick.

not many people remember "the carey treatment", and i can't say i blame them.blake edwards did this during his lean years (i.e. - between "pink panther" movies.) and for a story of a doctor turned detective (coburn) working to solve a murder in his hospital, it's actually pretty forgettable.coburn is dependable as always and o'neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings. the story twists and turns aren't very involving and even the climax, which is supposed to be nerve-wracking, is gut-wrenching instead.a missed opportunity altogether, and an unfortunate one at that, since it was based on a michael crichton book. oh well, at least crichton didn't write a sequel to it.one star. "carey" on, coburn.

esther williams plays a romantically unattached water-skiing secretary who longs to stop "walking on the water" and be some man's wife; van johnson and tony martin are her potential choices for a husband. despite fine aquatic sequences filmed at florida's cypress gardens, this romantic comedy is awfully stale. as helmed by plodding director charles walters, everything here is made to seem intentionally innocuous, which doesn't lend the picture much staying power. even esther's big moments in the water are not quite up to the mesmerizing leaps from her other swimming vehicles, though they are preferable to the asides with the men, both of whom are colorless. carroll baker, in her film debut as martin's disgruntled ex-girlfriend, is the liveliest of the bunch. flimsy stuff, indeed. *1/2 from ****

first, ifc runs town and country, and now this. the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip-off is that town and country was watchable. this isn't.i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else's dime. belushi is especially irritating. his scene with candy (doing a z-grade dom deluise) was torture. speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless shepherd, and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts!the real "crime" (besides this being green-lighted) is shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half-million bucks! if you buy that, i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in!

1st watched 12/26/2008 -(dir-eugene levy): corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers. but this one by charles shyer & nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. the story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling americans, played by richard lewis and sean young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return. upon trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder. the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story. the other cast members include character actors john candy, james belushi, cybill shepherd, george hamilton and others. after the police find out about the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened. none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi/shepherd couple. this isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't that good. there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile. try it, maybe you'll like it, probably you won't.

this flick, which is a.k.a. "life in the fast lane" is easily one of the least entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. i think it was made in mind of the sick, twisted and jaded l.a. women who represent about .00000001 of the population in the states. the characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead. after she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors, a cheap laugh is attempted (and unsucceeds) by sticking a cork in the boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding. oh, clever! patrick dempsey (whose movies are almost always a class act --sarcasm) plays this "devil" who changes her life - but from what we've seen, her life was this series of vignettes to begin with. no emotion, no laughs, no story. the only reason i give this a 2 is that jeffrey jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style (albiet zero substance) in the camerawork. otherwise, one of the 5 worst films i've seen. grade 2 out of 10 an f! i think that even the most drugged out junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film. i can't stress enough how much you should stay away.

the imdb plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is noah taylor's movie, when fairuza balk is the central character. it is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish, pointless, non-movie. balk breaks up with boyfriend taylor, sleeps with the devil (i guess - played by dempsey), and accidentally kills taylor -- who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost. may be the worst movie i have ever seen.

i just got back from seeing, "comedian". it was...alright. it kept me looking at the screen. its just not the type of thing i like to go pay $7 to see.now don't get me wrong, it'd make a great hbo feature. if this were something i was watching on tv, i'd be hooked right in. it gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after getting on stage. it will interest anyone who likes watching comics.but when i go to the movies, i like to be entertained. i'm not there to be educated. now i know what its like for jerry seinfeld before he goes out on stage....great. but truthfully, i'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about any of that.one more thing: with the bad attitude onry adams has; i'd expect to see him taking my order from burger king before i see his hbo special. he wasn't funny. he's the kind of person that you love to hate.

i liked half-life. i am still it's fan. it was frightening, intelligent and challenging. i don't tell any news it is one the best fps ever made. maybe i'm too hardcore half-life fan but the so called half-life 2 is not half-life 2.and i have a question: is this the next chapter of half-life? maybe the creators -valve- thinks so but i don't. where are the intelligent enemies? where is the frightening atmosphere? nowhere. i believe they wanted to make a bit different half-life (instead of another research station story), but they didn't just made a very different one, they made something that has to do with half-life like for example quake does to doom. the entire game so unsightly and unreal that it's almost forlorn.though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play, the idea to make a revolutionary physic-driven gameplay has utterly failed. when you get the gravity-gun, that can move objects, you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon- that would turn the schematic fps gameplay upside down. the truth is, you can't use gravity-gun as a real weapon. why? because the best you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. if you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots. if you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own "hand". the gravity-gun doesn't work as a weapon. the best usage is solving some physic-puzzles. i ask valve: why? the truth is you must use your boring, schematic fps weapons to the end(except for last level) weapons are not that made original half-life a classic. if gravity-gun would be always like at the last level -a real weapon- i'd admire what valve did. but not this. this is disappointing.so if you want half-life then you are searching at the wrong place. maybe you will enjoy it but i repeat: it is everything but not half-life and even not a faithful continuation of that. this is the greatest disappointment of all time. valve have shown they can make awful games too. they have managed that.

this film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but it revealed incompetence at almost every level.the presence of roger moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre, because moore always has lead roles and he can't act. but this movie also had ian holm and lee marvin in it, and was based on a wilbur smith book, so i thought i'd give it a chance when i saw the dvd for sale in the bargain bin...it was a mistake. the opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a reel, with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated. the scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a german crew. this bad editing was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me watching. the special effects were good, and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in german, indicating that the director at least paid attention to historical detail. i was surprised. so i kept watching, and then moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed. bad acting, clichéd lines, clichéd cinematography and cheap humour...but worst of all, there is a disastrous attempt to blend the light-hearted feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy. it just does not work.the film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started  in the middle of a reel.

i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film: heavy on style, little on substance and originality. does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? plus, this film wallows in late 1970s chic, which works for some (sofia coppola's "the virgin suicides" comes to mind) but not for this director.another reviewer compared this to harmony korine's work and i agree. yet i don't view this as a positive thing (what has he done lately, anyway?). "bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved. if you happen to see it late night on cable, turn the channel and watch something else instead.

it seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the silvery screen disgorged such unutterable tripe as this and many other 'adventure' movies. i am reminded of the similarly lavish, but equally wretched 'ashanti' outlined elsewhere.whatever motivated a-list actors to sign-on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer. they must have been very, very desperate. to be perfectly candid, roger moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death. although extremely handsome in his youth, his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow. every emotion from a to b is conveyed by this simple stratagem. his were the dog-days of james bond. lee marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings, perhaps most memorably 'paint your wagon' and 'the dirty dozen'. he has a comic streak, but he is much better when he plays it straight.the excellent ian holm is a throwaway, hardly recognisable blacked-up as a mute african. everyone else just turned up for their pay-cheques.the only plausible and watchable element is the german cruiser. it looks like a very large model. but it is believably massive and appears authentic - as do its crew. the rest isn't even hokum. the childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about, as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of lee marvin's gin. here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going. there are hints of 'the african queen', a snatch from 'the pride & the passion', 'gold', and one or two other rip-offs from movies who's titles don't come readily to mind.strangely, i have seen it 3 times, each occasion it has been shown on television when i have been laid low with a cold or the flu. perhaps that is influencing my judgement - but not much.compare it with any indiana jones movie and you will see what i mean.i have given it two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end, though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that.time for another lemsip, i think.

this western/musical/comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen.i found it much too slow.it just plodded along to the inevitable end.i also found it disjointed.i couldn't wait for it to be over.randolph scott is the headliner here,and lloyd bridges also stars.but for my money money edgar buchanan is the best of the bunch.buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day,many times providing comic relief,as he does in this picture.i also liked ann dvorak as rita.otherwise,though,i can't think of much to recommend this movie.the movie is based on a novel by ernest haycock,who also wrote the novel stagecoach,which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939,and remade in 1966 and again in 1986.the 1939 version of stagecoach,is in my mind,one of the best movies ever made.anyway.as for abilene town,my vote is a 3/10

five years after the us civil war, western folk are more concerned with the age old war between homesteaders and cattle ranchers. the cattlemen herd their wares, from texas to the trail town of abilene, kansas. there, the cowboys find not only big money, but also big confrontation, with homesteaders. tall in the saddle marshal randolph scott (as dan mitchell) tries to keep peace in the town. mr. scott has experience mediating between trail hands and saloon patrons. he also juggles the town's finest looking women: sexy saloon singer ann dvorak (as rita) and pretty church lady rhonda fleming (as sherry). boozy county sheriff edgar buchanan (as bravo trimble) offers more comic relief than sharp-shooting assistance."abilene town" begins with some promising symbolism and contrast: gunshots interrupt scott and ms. fleming singing a hymn in church; then, the camera switches to ms. dvorak sexily singing her saloon number, which causes a man to fire his gun in pleasure. after that, it really becomes quite a standard western; it is somehow duller than it should be, but not quite awful. young lloyd bridges appears as one of the homesteaders. dvorak's leggy costume is the film's greatest asset; in it, she is a real mover. **** abilene town (1/11/46) edwin l. marin ~ randolph scott, ann dvorak, edgar buchanan

so this is where columbia's head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start, eh? yeah,it's none other than mr. jules white who is credited (or is it rather, "exposed") as the director of this entry into mgm's dogville series. given co-credit as co-director is one zion myers; whose name is heretofore unknown to us. mr. meyers was, no doubt, the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and "acting". in short, he must have been the dog trainer on the set.the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year, the big house; which starred chester morris, wallace beery, robert montgomery and a stellar cast in support. we must plead ignorance in regards to this title; not having seen it up to this point. (sorry,schultz!) but there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we've read about the movie*; not to mention some particular character specific gags. for example, we observed a canine convict who st-st-stuttered and deduced,correctly, that the bow-wow actor was mimicking character comedian, roscoe ates. we later cross-checked with the cast of the big house and presto, his name is there! (brilliant deduction, one fit for holmes & watson!) the practice of lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short. it was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval. after all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; besides, any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying.** as for the movie, itself, we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner. seeing so many of "man's best friends" being so artificially animated into one, long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we, who make up the audience. i mean just how many pooches were made to bark, needlessly, in order to achieve the illusion of 'talking'? when it comes to pets, or "animal companions" as the politically correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. we don't enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non-funny,extended play format.as incredible as it may seem, the step that mr. jules white made from mgm's shorts to heading up columbia's 2 reeler production would seem to have been not only a $tep up in the area of finance$; but al$o in the arti$tic content. we never thought that being producer-director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 stooges, andy clyde and hugh herbert, as well as some who certainly had seen better days, such as charley chase, buster keaton and harry langdon; would be a step up cinematically.in case we haven't made our point yet; we're officially panning this one. so, view it at your own risk. we warned you! note * we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel & hardy send-up, pardon us (hal roach/mgm, 1931) in both mr. laurel & mr. hardy by john mccabe (1962) and the films of laurel & hardy by william k. everson (1967). both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement.note ** the prison picture became a genre of its own; all owing a debt to the big house. in pardon us, laurel & hardy, hal roach and its director did a first class spoof,the first of many; for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come.

well, i am so glad i watched this on hbo instead of paying for it in the theaters or video store. the movie has some points, but, if you want to make it a worthwhile movie, i suggest that you become what the main characters are called...stoners.2/10

there no doubt in one mined that this movie is stupid and unfunny joke, but tell the truth it is quite entertaining (if you re first time viewer and try not to analyzed anything) over all the movie have a very good ideas but badly written.the story of the two losers, waking up to find out that they can't remember what happen to them the day before. only to find out later that they are after by the angry twin girl friends, aliens, transsexual stripper, aliens nerds and some gangs members. isn't it like the bourne identity? yeah yeah, i know - how can i compare the two movies, but what the hell? they both have no memories; peoples were after them and so on. anyway the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer that like stupid movie. reason to watch: · loads of young talented actors, · very stupid (after all you know it a stupid movie, why not make it extreme)reason not to: · if you like to analyzed, then forget it, · talented young actors turn bad, · good plod turn really badrating: 4/10 (grade: e+)------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- --------- --------- ----'dude where's my car' -wait, what do you expected from ashton kutcher's movie. i think almost every people got the same answer for this guy - 'a really stupid movie'. apart from 'that 70s' shows' this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (he should thank the series for his reputation). 'dude where's my car', is one of his trademark -'stupidity'. somehow his film is even worst than adam sandler's movies, (can you imagine that). the movie is really non-sense, no story line, and no nothing. mara sokoloff, jennifer garner, alison sweeney and s.w.scoot should not have wasted their talent on this garbage. they even came up with 'seriously, dude where's my car'. this shows how the movie companies are dying of making money rather than quality.max: 4/10recommendation: borrow it from your friends or just forget about it

well, dude where's my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written, cast, filmed & edited in less than a day. i honestly can't believe this got made (or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing). the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "dumb-funny", and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it. oddly enough, unlike most mindless slapstick comedies, this movie actually has too much plot - every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot. of course, they were obviously going for moronic, but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever...there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed: donkeylips from the old nickalodean show "salute your shorts" has a very small role. this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though, you just watch...

i just finishing watching goliath awaits that i ordered from my library. i remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to watch it with my son. anyway, the movie was less than 2 hours running time and i thought it was much longer when i first saw it. the back of the vhs box states that the goliath "emtombs a nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever." the divers were supposedly on a covert mission to retrieve the demonic document. there was nothing even spoken about retrieving this document. also, the box says that the "bestial ship's insatiable boiler feeds on human blood." that would make this a horror movie and there was also nothing revealed in the movie about this. i can't remember the details when i watched this years ago on tv...but could the back of this box actually be true? maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details??just wondering if anyone knows anything about this.

i know...i know: it's difficult (if not paradoxical) for there to be such a thing as "believable" fantasy. but, to me, there is also such a condition wherein too much unbelievability interfere's with, or distracts from my overall opinion of the movie. the latter was the case for me with regard to goliath awaits. not only did i have too many unanswered questions concerning the storyline, but some of the acting, too, i thought, was a bit over-the-top. (maybe, though, it was the writing: asking them to recite too many trite, predictable, cliched (over-?) reactions.) others have said enough about the plot. i just wish that it was done - and, i think that it could have been - more convincingly. p. s.: this is a fresh comment about this film - i just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago; not a recollection from years ago.

there ought to be some kind of prosecution to punish producers from financing screenplays this stupid. i feel that some kind of criminalization of bad film might prevent more films this idiotic from being made. sure it has an interesting cast of characters, but i don't think i've ever seen a more cardboard performance from an entire cast as in this uniquely crappy piece of crap. that director ought to be punished somehow for not eliciting at least some kind of performance out of these people. so detachment is a theme, (no really, they'll beat you over the head with this one), it doesn't mean every character has to recite their lines as if they on npr. did i mention this movie was crappy? lastly i'm not sure what connection one's memories would have with terminal bone cancer, but i'm reasonably certain if you were totally brain dead your cancer would continue to grow regardless. this movie is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals, and non-retarded people. oh, and lastly, bumblebees fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by beating their wings just like every other flying insect. i absolutely despise people presenting false knowledge as fact. next time do a little research before using an imbecilic misconception as a premise for an entire freaking movie. just kidding believe in jesus!

i rented this movie because elijah wood has done some good work and i thought this might be an overlooked treasure. it was not a treasure. i don't know if this was straight to video, but it should have been straight to the dump.elijah wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a much-too-brief shower scene. but, no sane person would like this script. imagine memento played by teen actors, but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. case in point: janeane garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently `keeping the chain of mediocrity alive').as if false memories syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine weren't hokey enough, the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled. this same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between wood's character and the girl from she's all that, who plays the saintly sister of wood's angry cancer-victim friend.adding to the triteness of this screenplay, wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and kidney, a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. kidney's dying wish comes true when dr. garofalo gives him his own walkman. this character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on-again, off-again relationship to walking. usually bound to a wheelchair, kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it.kindey's characterization may be one small detail, but it is indicative of this film's many other flaws. the bumblebee flies anyway is definitely bumbling, but it never flies.

terrible acting, terrible script, wholly unrealistic. the bumblebee flies anyway exemplifies the cliches and sentimentalism that movie studios love to cram down viewers' throats. elijah wood is unimaginably bad in the primary role, and the plot points are contrived and sappy. cook's and wood's relationship is laughable at best. but the worst element of bumblebee is the script. this is some of the most mind-numbingly bad dialogue i have ever had the misfortune to hear. bumblebees actually crawling inside my ears and stinging my eardrums would be preferable to hearing elijah wood robotically spit out his pseudo-profound lines. i wish a "bumblebee project" would be performed on me, so i could mercifully have no memories of this stinker.

an annoying and talentless american documentary maker learns of a legendarysouth african monster, the half-caste. tradition says that it is a half-human, half-leopard creature with the closest parallel being that of the werewolf of european tradition. rather than focus on the creature, the film follows the meanderings of the film crew. there is little action or suspense until late in the film. this problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating characters generating a ceaseless amount of even more irritating talk. the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew. perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of the blair witch project (1999) or the last broadcast (1998). regardless, the film fails on most levels. avoid at all costs.

i remember seeing this at my local blockbuster and picked it up cause i was curious. i liked movies about mythological creatures. i like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. this is based on half-caste, a half-human half-leopard creature that preys on the people of africa.the movie is horrendous! the actors are terrible! there is no script whatsoever! it's all improvised! the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it. it's obvious bull*bleep*! they film at night to make it scary. but, they have failed to scare me. after the first person was killed, i put this back in the case and took it back to blockbuster. one of the most boring movies i've ever seen.now you are probably saying i have no right to review a movie if i haven't finished it. well, this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be watched all the way through.1 star out of 10. this is really bad!

probably the worst movie i have ever seen. it is so cheesily filmed, the focus is not even on this supposed "real half-caste", it is more on the crew coming from hollywood to make the movie. no cinematic significance whatsoever, and if i could take back the almost 1 1/2 hours that i spent watching this film, i would feel much better.at first, it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically, like an actual hollywood production. however, then they go into the narration of the story, and it's filmed so f***ing terribly. it's supposed to be a take on "blair witch project" really, since they pretty much use what you would think is 'real camera footage', it's not, don't be fooled.worst movie i have ever seen . . . on the positive side, it has like one semi-scary scene in it, and the visuals of the half-caste weren't too bad looking at all. don't rent

this movie was a big disappointment. the plot sounded great, about a half-human, half-leopard creature in africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young american adults. when many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are taken into questioning. i wouldn't even call this a horror movie, since most of the movie is actually about the (mis)adventures of the aforementioned, narcissistic 20-somethings, which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high (isn't as entertaining as it sounds--trust me). you rarely get to see the creature, and the main actor (who also happens to be the director, screen writer, editor, and producer!) is incredibly annoying.i was finally so annoyed by the never-ending dialogue that i fast-forwarded to the end. i had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movie...and i was right. thus, this awful movie is utterly predictable, too--as if it wasn't bad enough. moral of the story: avoid movies that are acted, directed, edited, produced and written by the same nobody. and avoid this movie, unless held at gunpoint.

i swear, i had never seen such a bad movie as half caste is. not only because it just makes no sense, is a huge piece of egolatry and self-confidence that makes me puke.sebastian apocada (in spanish apocada has a similar pronunciation to "apocado" which means "out of life and happiness") makes here a one man army movie thinking he is sam raimi or the boys who directed the blair witch project. this is the blair kittie project, with an expensive low budget.the story, a couple of american filmmakers that go to africa to make a documentary of the half caste, is just no-sense. the way of filming, inserting high speed shots with slow motion shots, just revolts your stomach more than the stupid lines (what the hell is that dialog about bestiality?) or the lame performances. by the way, i don't believe this cast (or caste?) is american, they all look european to me.to finish this, just say that the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie. they put a fake award achievement (as most original film) and a nice cover (in spain the cover had the half caste image in negative), so i feel now unhappy, because i can't demand my 14 euros back.

you know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh? half-caste wasn't one of them. which sounds good, right? but no, it's not. it's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that's fun to watch because it's lame, or not well acted, or has bad special effects or anything else like that. no, half-caste is just plain boring. they don't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so. it's just kids running around in the african bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even funny. the last 20 minutes, though, are hilarious. i have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to watch that cgi leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys i couldn't tell apart anyway. if you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, don't rent this one, because you'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff. if you do accidentally rent this movie, i'd recommend fast forwarding to the end, and skipping any scene that happens in daylight. you won't miss anything. you won't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back-story.

it's saturday, it's raining, and i think every movie should have at least one comment... so i just watched "the crime doctor's courage" all the way through. it's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime. the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever. i guess that's not too surprising for a b movie of this period. there are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-wwii, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.the "crime doctor" is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some r&r from his psychiatry practice on the east coast. he hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers. the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (aka dr. watson), and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).there is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. and then there are the mysterious braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club. the dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's. though the story location is california, the braggas appear to live in a castle!there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused, but i won't divulge any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (even though i can think of many, many, b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) i have not seen any other movies from the "crime doctor" series, so i can't make any comparisons.

frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest. this icon, who has some christopher lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.the first ten minutes is well-filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem. but the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as "house of death") and never really gets that initial spurt of energy back.lots of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things. twice we see poisonous gas being used. but the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. boy, is that false advertising, unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch "matlock".the general principle of the film is decent: horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon. a modern equivalent (digging up vincent price or peter cushing) would make a great film. maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful. sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in application, and this film offers that example.the only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young jeffrey combs. i saw him and thought "that's jeffrey combs" but felt i was mistaken as the box never mentioned him. but sure enough, combs was present. (a note to this movie's film-makers: mention combs on the cover of the dvd, you'll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.) if you're a jeffrey combs die-hard, check out this early role. otherwise, i cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. let me suggest "intruder" or "popcorn", as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time.

this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling, moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts. it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film.but it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral. a vaguely plausible plotline (and that's being generous)becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explained.this wouldn't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn't so cheesy, the acting so wooden (despite a strong british cast) and the direction so uninspiring. this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an eyelid, at least not in comparison to his earlier work.my advice in this case, if it's hard to get hold of, don't waste the effort. if you're a brit like me and it's in your local video shop, steer well clear. perhaps head to the video entitled "american beauty" - now that's an example of great british direction.

independent film that would make hollywood proud. the movie substitutes good looks for good acting, a cryptic plot for a good story line, and self-absorption for character development. may be i missed something, go see it for yourself.

weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, i wonder why udita goswami is there in the movie world in the first place ? she tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin) but failed to impress.music wasn't that impressive as well, only one song "jhalak dikhlajaa" was worth listening to..... aksar, the title ? well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end, but it didn't make sense..there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story, which made it more boring. however if someone's a dino morea fan, please go ahead and watch it.

emraan hashmi post murder did some good roles in bhatt films but other director just made use of his kissing and naughty imageaksar is one of them and it came after aaa, jawani diwani in a row and i was already fed up of him and such roles the film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an abbas mustan film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climaxanant mahadevan makes a terrible film music is saving grace camera-work is fabulousemraan hashmi just repeats his act of his earlier films and has 2 expressions throughout dino looks stiff, talks as if he is practicing hindi and does okay in some scenes udita is expressionless and irritates

aksar is an awful movie. the script, the story, the acting are all simply laughable. dino morea plays a man who pays emraan hashmi to seduce his wife. yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds. both morea and hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly bad acting. udita goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. she is good-looking but has zero acting talent. the film has one hit song called "jhalak diklaja" which is composed and sung by himesh reshammiya. i never could understand the hype around this song as i never found it particularly good though it is catchy. the film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing. avoid this cheapo at any cost.

i often wonder how movies like this even get made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them.with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ludicrous they were. the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as "jo sheena roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai" and "yeh versace hai madam" (yeah right).every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. acting was awful. constumes (lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion), screenplay etc etc, just one word- rubbish.for those people who love hashmi and his movies, watch it. as for me, i'll never get those two and a half hours back. the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent.

what movie is this??? a horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the "bhatt camp". the movie starrs emraan hashmi, udita goswami and dino morea. the movie has "no base". it just goes like this... dino an udita are married and living in a rich mansion. however dino doesn't like udita to the heart as he wants only her wealth. he loves someone else (tara sharma). so he bribes emraan to have an affair with udita so that he could catch them and finally split up with udita.. how boring!! however emraan falls in love with udita and vice versa. lastly when udita gets imprisonment for killing emraan, dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her. udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly. so she lends all her wealth to dino. finally dino comes out of the police - station and goes with tara with all the wealth. what a fraud!! the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie. now the individual ratings: (out of 5) emraan: * * udita: * 1/2 dino : * 1/2 overall acting: * 1/2 direction: * * story: * music: * * * 1/2 final rating: * 1/2 poor performances and poor casting....... music: good... i rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (dont waste your time !!!!)

not a good one. -not at all.this installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of amityville itself.it's basically nothing. my bet is that this film was made for some extra fast-cash to buy a boat or something... because this one's just ridiculous... thankfully, it doesn't kill or ruin the series, but it just has no effect on the series at all.i'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than "the amityville curse".

at the rate these movies are ploughing through the artifacts from the amityville house it won't be long before we get down to the floorboards, but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series. a homeless man hands it over to artist hairdo ross partridge, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. this mundane horror trundles along at a dull pace, leaving us waiting for a build up that never comes as the various 'spooky' goings-on lead to a dumb finale. bland and lifeless, with ropey acting and partridge's huge hair not helping matters.

oh dear. this sequel has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the amityville home. the mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. the mirror is given to a photographer, keyes(ross partridge)by a bum(..who just so happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family)and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft(..such as keyes' painter pal suki, portrayed by julia nickson-soul)where he lives when they look into it. soon keyes is having nightmares, looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood, worried that he might follow in his footsteps. soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him.pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this, such as david naughton(american werewolf in london)as the proprietor of the loft with which keyes lives, richard roundtree as an eccentric sculptor/artist, terry o'quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially lin shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum(..the one which held keyes' father) soon to be closed down.rounding out the film, the sexy, leggy lala sloatman as keyes' supportive girlfriend, barbara howard(friday the 13th:the final chapter)as naughton's betrayed wife(..he was on the verge of starting an affair with nickman-soul), jack orend as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did, and robert rusler(a nightmare on elm street 2:freddy's revenge)as a rejected lover(..of nickson-soul)who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal.this film is a poor special effects movie merely using the amityville title as a cash-in. the franchise has never been that great to begin with, but as each sequel was green-lit, it grew worse and worse. after the third film, furniture from the infamous house become "possessed" items tormenting folks. the cast try hard, though, but the material(..a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means)is lacking in quality..and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters. o'quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement such as this. all's not lost, you get to see sloatman always wearing super short skirts(..or her man's shirt in panties), showing off her legs throughout..hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. believe it or not, amityville:a new generation was the seventh film in the franchise! coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by nickson-soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it.

'a new generation' is the third amityville entry to base its plot around writer john g. jones's premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. first a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. however, this is also the first amityville since 'the possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. this time around, keyes terry (robert partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named franklin bronner (sonny montelli in 'amityville ii') murdered his entire family. unfortunately for terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood.this 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'it's about time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. however, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. on the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*.there's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. or maybe it's just tedious anyway. director john murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. if they don't take it too seriously, why should we?which is a shame, because 'a new generation' has a more-than-capable cast. i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name 'julia nickson' in the credits. she captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, i was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. terry o'quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while i'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing ibsen.the sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. clearly, murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all.'a new generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. however, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'the possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.

well, at least this was the last sequel that i could find at blockbuster, because this movie was just downright horrible. i mean, i can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house. we're talking starting a horrible fire, bulldozing, flood, etc. but a mirror? how hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror?! this was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of amityville into the picture! well, a group of friends who are pretty much from the start, are a bunch of freaks. one of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy, teaching me a valuable lesson, don't buy things from homeless creepy guy. of course, the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group, though i can't imagine anyone missing them.please, skip amityville: a new generation, i've already got a few complaints about my generation, so i think this was a premonition. not to sound so crazy. :p but believe me, this is horribly acted, not well thought out, and not even scary! i feel so bad for the original writers of the amityville horror, they must be crying every time person witnesses this film.1/10

there isn't enough space to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess. silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of this movie's problems. the film looks like it was conceived in the mid-eighties and just stewed until it could finally be made in the early nineties. the mullet-headed "hero," (complete with fashionable "miami vice" three-days shadow beard), the ham-fisted slams at ronald reagan, it would be funny if it didn't take itself so seriously. as it is, the movie is just pathetic. i actually feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine nude scenes in this awful movie.

movies just don't get worse than this. horrible plot, terribly timed, pathetic characters and effects and yes this is using "b" standards.and for the guys: nothing, this movie is a terrible let down, couple scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but build up with no delivery.this movie appeals to no one, horrible movie,it had bad; plot, acting, "b" flavor, special effects and everything else. plus no nudity or erotics for guys or the girls.

the fact that a film is on dvd doesn't guarantee that its quality is very good. the fact that a film's quality is threadbare doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvd.the plots of these films are of little consequence. they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films  anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett  or, in a pinch, basil rathbone. there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a one-shot basis  such as "seven per cent solution" or "private life of sherlock holmes". in any event, these films are considerably less estimable.here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes, even if the results tend toward disappointing. this appears to be the only disc with these films on it (although "deadly necklace") appears by itself in the same version on other discs."(sherlock holmes and) the deadly necklace" dates from 1962, although it neither looks it nor sounds it. some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios. not that hammer hasn't turned out some really schlock stuff, but where christopher lee was concerned, they usually did a better job. the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1:1.33 copy in black-and white. the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color, and the snipped ends of the film's aspect suggest it may originally have been 1:1.66 or more.the film is set in the early 20th century  not improbable, since holmes was still working then (and didn't actually die until 1957). however, the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story. it involves an egyptian necklace, and professor moriarty shows up as a world-famous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime. the plot is melodramatic and banal.the biggest defect of this film is that  for whatever unfathomable reason  hammer filmed it in germany. it was nonetheless filmed in english. it was then dubbed in german and then re-dubbed in english. so what you hear isn't lee nor any of the other original actors, but a bunch of unknowns  not that, outside of lee, i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors. this is too bad, since lee (see his "hound of the baskervilles") makes a quite decent holmes. as it is, his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamon.the music for this film is primarily jazzy, in a possible attempt to be "period". too bad nobody thought of ragtime. as it is, the music doesn't relate to what's happening on the screen, and often is at odds with the action.the other film is "(sherlock holmes and) the speckled band" from 1931, starring a young raymond massey. the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort, and in fact a bit better. massey makes a quite respectable holmes, although he certainly doesn't own the rôle in the way rathbone did and brett does. the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. the acting  as is true of many films of this period  owes a lot to the post-victorian stage and to silent films.it should be noted that, while "the deadly necklace" is available on dvd by itself, "the speckled band" is available only with the former film.there is very little else to be said of this film. the settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone). taken altogether, it's an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with "deadly necklace" only.

creakiness and atmosphere this film has, but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed. raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes, almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe, which he trades in for a laborer's garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr. rylott (lyn harding). what wasn't clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead. if as in the case of helen (angela baddeley), he didn't want her to run off to get married, he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched.other curiosities abound as well. after setting an early wedding date with helen, the fiancée is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture. the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoner's death provides merely a diversion, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding.athole stewart competently portrays holmes' aide dr. watson, though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea. as rylott, lyn harding is sufficiently menacing, a trait that would be put to good use as holmes' nemesis professor moriarty in two later films - 1935's "the triumph of sherlock holmes" and 1937's "murder at the baskervilles".with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera, it's surprising that the story line isn't more disrupted than it is. it's integrity is generally maintained, even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps. i guess that would be my main complaint with the film, as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp.

this show demonstrates the depths to which uk tv pre-watershed drama has sunk. with these dull scripts, mediocre acting, poor plots, awful dialog, one is forced to watch a dvd of any old er episode to see excellent hospital drama.none of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act!if you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style tv, this is the show for you. personally i like something with more meat on the bone. sadly as with all other uk licence payers, i'm funding this dross.

may 2nd: someone clicked 11 nos, and then proceeded to do 15 more on my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey!may 1st: as i write this, i'm still very much under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller i've ever seen. i've got a major case of the giggles, but i'll try and calm down. (it's kind of hard to write when your nose spills snot and the mouth ejects sporadic drool onto the keyboard.) a pair of young women who just returned from a vacation take a ride on a shuttle bus. a couple of young guys join them. but the bus isn't really a taxi service: it's a kidnapping vehicle. (don't snicker!) its driver has been part of an organized "white slavery" gang who snatch young women from airports, and they've been doing it for five years. (don't laugh.) five years on the same airport, without the police or even the fbi ever getting any wind of it. (no giggling, please.) apparently, dozens of women go missing on in the same exact place for years and years - and yet no-one notices a trend. is the fbi that incompetent? the world of "shuttle" seems to consist of three types of people: easily kidnappable blonds, dumb/comatose/invisible fbi agents, and omnipotent psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blonds with tattooed behinds).the driver has barely stayed alive on this one mission, and yet he's done this for - i repeat - five years, without being killed or losing one of his limbs. (stop laughing...) did i mention that the driver is immortal? need i mention it? we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna. you can stab them, bounce them against the walls of a bus repeatedly, caress them softly with a hammer, prick nine-inch nails into their ears... hell, you could stick a hand-grenade into the average hollywood psycho's mouth, and he'd still escape with only minor scratches. no, the driver is not satan or even a minor demon, but just a regular hollywood psycho with better survival abilities than the biggest, meanest sewer cockroach.the basic plot outline: a guy loses all the fingers on one hand in a silly scene. (a magical bus that reads and obeys minds!) the passengers try to escape. they fail. they get hurt. they sulk. they argue. they try to escape. they fail. they get injured. they argue. they try to escape. they fail. they get injured. they try to escape. they fail. they try to escape. the kidnappees manage to snatch the gun from the driver! alas, they do not kill him because the golden hollywood rule of gandhi-like pacifism prohibits them from doing it. (no giggling.) one of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang! (stop laughing.) he is played by an actor who studied in the rob zombie/john travolta school of over-acting & silly mugging. he threatens rape. later on, one of the gals hits him with a crowbar over the head, about a dozen times... very hard. only seconds later does he regain consciousness. yep, he survives. (immortal, remember?) he gets killed a little later. (no idea how, though! he is not supposed to be killable.) the kidnapees argue. they try to escape. one of them escapes! alas, the psychos are just far too god-like in their powers not to re-capture their prey. the game starts all over again: the passengers try to escape. they fail. they sulk. they stare into the void. they get hurt. they try to escape. they fail. they get hurt...you get the picture.frankly, i believe that a drugged, heavily disorientated, inebriated snail would have escaped these nincompoop captors with ease. there were so many opportunities. at one point these bumbling psychos (remember: five years!) even send one of the kidnapees into a grocery store! she leaves a message to the police. however, yeah... you guessed it: this fictional fairy-tale u.s. city has no police.and just as you thought the movie couldn't get any dumber - not even if luc besson and brian de palma joined forces to lend a hand with the script - it does. the girls are kidnapped in order to be sent to some remote island(?), and this is achieved by transporting them as cargo. apparently, this fictional america has no fbi, no police - and no border customs either. it does however have immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. one blond had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. how is it that victims in these dumb thrillers never try to finish off their immortal adversaries once they have them down on the floor and injured? i guess i answered that one myself: they're immortal! so why bother trying, she must have thought...so why was one blond gassed to death and the other one boxed and shipped alive (complete with a kitty-litter box, and the funniest photograph since demi moore's primary school pictures)? could it be the tattoo? i think they killed the prettier one, but that's just me. was her tattoo that ugly? could it be that i don't care? why should i search for logic in a movie made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? besides, how can i even think straight when i'm laughing so hard half the time?!naturally, this being a 21st-century horror/thriller, the mobile phone doesn't work... perhaps this invincible gang control not only the fbi, the police, and the customs, but satellites in space too.do i have to spell it out? there are far easier ways to kidnap people. and far more intelligent people who should be making movies. give an idiot a camera and he'll lay an egg every single time... that sort of answers the eternal riddle of which came first: the egg or the bird-brained director.

waste of 1h45 this nasty little film is one to avoid, its like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap, why the writer wrote this is obvious..he has no soul and did it to try and me some money. the twists were obvious, when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and didn't etc.. only good thing about it is i've discovered 1 new actress worth watching..peyton list, don't watch shuttle though, there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world. spend your time more wisely watch good films, do some exercise, cook a nice meal..anything but waste your time on rubbish like this

just saw this film at the fantasy filmfest berlin. i am not impressed.as far as the story goes. too girlfriends return from their mexico vacation. while waiting for their luggage they get to know a couple of boys, who then take the last and of course wrong shuttle bus to the city. on board is also one other older man, so weirdly portrayed that you instantly guess that he is one of the bad guys. the other one is the driver.the shuttle takes them into industrial wasteland and then one after the other goes done, a little blood, some cut of extremities, some violence, mostly playing with the fear of the girls in the end after some ups and downs, heres and there's, some not too new scary moments, everyone is dead but the driver and the girls. the girls end up in some garage, where one of them is killed, after confessing that she had slept with the other girlfriends boyfriend. the other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the left-over kidnapper (yep, weirdo got killed) in some cargo box to asia (a freight harbor being the final picture.) first. story. tons of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, loose ends, and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. i can't see how such a unprofessional looser is supposed to have abducted dozens of women (as is indicated by a drawer full of drivers licences...aha) second. acting. mediocre at its best.third. scare factor. ok. but i am bored by torture as a means to nothing but itself. trade with humans could be a good reason for a horror flick, but it's not used as one, just as a background.fourth, music and sound. some nice tries, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, warehouse garage, and truck sounds have not been really explored. music? would have been worse without it, but apart from that. some pseudo moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination. ok, i guess.verdict: avoid it!

"shuttle" is/was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way i ever could imagine. this movie has lost its story, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. all the next scenes are totally out of proportion. the driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun - knife etc.. even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box. but what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage. i really felt sick and misled when the movie ended. it could have been such a great one if the story was far more better. in my opinion even a kid would make a better story. and why shipping the girl with water and food. i quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through. and when the movie reached its almost admirably sick over-the-top final twist, i had completely given up (better say "throw-up). the worst thing about shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse. maybe writer/director anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time. think the better he'll move to a different genre. i keep my fingers crossed. but from now on i will read the comment on his future movies first before looking. a waste of time.

this is about as stupid as it gets.a classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation. it reminds me of a scene in "scary movie" where carmen electra flees from the killer. there are two signs, one marked "to safety", the other one "to sure death" (i am reciting from memory).and just like in scary movie, the characters always run into the direction marked "sure death". why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth and hold the door shut ??? did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy? why oh why, after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out? he was running over their friend and killing him a minute before, yet they have scruples ?? why oh why a hundred things more ... if this movie were a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. everything is so far-fetched, it's starting to physically hurt at times.add mercilessly overplaying "actors" and a small budget to that and here's what you get. looking at the rating and the comments, i get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie.the one thing missing really, is the infamous red toolbox from "while she was out" - a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.

this movie is stupid, made by stupid people. the plot i suppose works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions these characters take is insanely stupid! like, incredibly non-sensical stupid to the nth degree! basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots being captured, repeatedly, despite having many, many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. it does not make one lick of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever. stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational, and probably more fun than watching this.****spoilers**** the ending is hilarious!! the only good part of the movie! i nearly died laughing at the end! that whole stupid movie, and it ends with the dumb girl getting shipped off in a crate to white slavery in asia!! hilarious! i thought it was a totally awesome ending to a really sh!tty movie.

i hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in 'shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, you shoot your attacker. three times. five times. whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. i think even god would say, "good call." in a very 'hostel'-type film, but more realistic  as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, that is  'shuttle' was a decent film, though on the long side. a few good shocks (always call aaa even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. and aside from the typical "tie him up" instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. getting past those, it's enjoyable for what it is. basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from mexico home (wow, that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. and after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a "too-good-to-be-true" half-price shuttle ride. clichéd jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be alan ruck's stunt double from 'speed.' from here, it's obvious what happens (i did mention it was a 'hostel' knock off) but still, i didn't find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. though, it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, i would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.

the beginning was decent; the ending was alright.sadly, this movie suffers from complete and utter shallowness of the characters, unrealistic confrontations/fight scenes, lack of anyone intelligent outside of the shuttle. this makes for an awful middle screenplay. stuff to look for: overly obvious foreshadowing, fast-healing cuts, overly smoky fires, fun seatbelts, delayed reactions.i did give it a 4, not a 0, because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development. the relationship between the main, dark-haired girl and her fiancée is touched upon briefly, and the placement of the blond friend's impact on that relationship is present, though awkwardly so. the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done, though, as another commenter pointed out, not unexpected. ~viper~

i had a hard time sitting through this. every single twist and turn is predictable. you're sitting there just waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes, there it is! just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie. or 10 minutes out. et cetera. smart writing? no. torture porn? no, there's no nudity. other reviews calling this torture porn are most likely written by people on heavy drugs. unfortunately there's no torture and no nudity (yes, no nudity).there's no suspense at all in this "thriller". the only good part about this movie is the ending, but i'm not going to spoil that.i'm giving it a 2/10. a 1/10 would be a horrible b-movie. this movie had better acting.

brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night shuttle bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble. great twists and turns are totally, and i do mean totally wasted, in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description. what is going on in a general sense is okay, i mean the idea of a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one. the problem is that the details are so beyond belief that i would be shocked if you don't turn off the film in utter disbelief. gee, a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesn't go any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? it get worse from there, think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it, even to the point where they could just walk away, but never do. whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film. okay, maybe there is, the end, the end is clever. the end is the sort of thing that should freak you out. it should be the "oh #$*@!!!!" moment and become a classic of horror cinema. instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. one of the most brainless films of the year.

"shuttle" is an indie thriller about four young adults who get a ride late one night on a shuttle bus from the airport to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath.although some of the sequences of scares and it's unconventionally interesting plot work, some aspects just don't. the bad dialogue and unlikeable characters gives a good reason to not care for them. but, often the suspense works and asks you the question of "what would you do?" and usually what you would do isn't what these idiots on the shuttle do. if you're expecting a mindless, bloody horror film, you'll be mistaken. this is a film that causes you to use your mind, but, unfortunately, not until the end.four out of ten.

ok this will contain spoilers. now i have never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative/feed mix up at the elephant enclosure in the zoo! it has more plot holes than moth eaten lace and as for the 'realistic' plot line. well sexual slavery is a dreadful and very real world wide problem and this pile of bilge utilises this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease, shame on everyone involved for that piece of questionable judgement. but back to the film, if you were going to kidnap people from an airport, some of the most secure and camera happy places in the modern world by the way, then why plant a stoolie on the inside of the van who does bugger all until the plot needs a twist. just wait until you are out of the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive calmly to the warehouse and kill the guys, job done. on the passengers side, on at least three occasions the good guys have the bad guys incapacitated and are armed, waste them! once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull, but come on three times! and after he's killed most of you. also the guy is willing to put down the gun to stop a scarred cheek but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be cleared up with $20 dollars worth of drugs. i could go on and on about the amount of holes in this but i won't waste any more of my time. suffice to say that i have rarely been so insulted by such a dreadful piece of drivel and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls go voluntarily to new 'jobs' in distant lands and are abused, raped, and often killed by the gang master who meets them off the boat/plane and takes their passports and freedom. this s**t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this! do not waste your time!

my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child. we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment. this was one such movie, kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child, but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more in-depth review. the story has some old horror actor legend dying. i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price, without being likable and classy. he commits murders and dies, but what is this? is the movie over already? no, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave. i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing. seemed to have a good premise, but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.

first off i want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive. i managed to watch the whole doggone disgrace of a film . this movie brings a low to original ideas. yes it was original thus my 2 stars instead of 1. are our film writers that uncreative that they can only come up with this?? acting was horrible , and the characters were unlikeable for the most part. the lead lady in the story had no good qualities at all. they made her bf into some sort of a bad guy and i did not see that at all. maybe i missed something , i do not know.he was the most down to earth, relevant character in the movie. i did not shell out any money for this garbage. i almost wish peta would come to the rescue of this awful, offensive movie and form a protest. disgusting thats all i have to say anymore !

"inuyasha " was awful . this show was incredibly over -hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clichés. the characters are annoying and lifeless ,the story line is boring and endless .i think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing, but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with kikyou and kagome and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again . the script is cheesy and dumb and the animation is poor .the character design it 's very ugly ,i don't know why everyone love it ,all have the same face ! : big eyes , tiny noses , a line as the mouth and the typical anime haircuts . i find "inuyasha " incredibly boring and dumb . this have to be one of the most over -rated animated shows ever made .

don't kill me fans but i have something to say about this.pros: well, the most mildly interesting season that i've watched out of all the seasons that are out there of inuyasha just has tobe the shichinintai arc. unlike the rest of the seasons, i personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries; good god they're such likable characters. shame they were killed off. of course, i would write a 15 page essay one why i like the shichinintai so much but that would be boring for some of you. so this series actually does have some likable characters. i'll miss bankotsu... poor, poor psycho little boy.cons: outside of shichinintai arc, the series was overall boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating. kagome for example: she overreacts too much to my taste; she acts like yuka from elfen lied. inuyasha: he's a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword. what's so unique about him? he has adorable dog ears! tch. sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very cocky. naraku has just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world. miroku and sango... they have some color but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much. but what bugs me the most if the fact that they have absolutely no common sense at all. rumiko takahashi has done a lot better then this. i've seen it before.if you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no over repetitiveness, this is not for you then.

to be entirely frank, the popularity of this show saddens me. inuyasha is certainly not terrible - it has a few good moments, the occasional flash of clever humour, and, unlike so many animes, dignity. however, it is utterly lacking in the essential elements of a worthwhile story. from the start, its premise dooms it to be stereotypical. the main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and is, as one would suspect, a totally generic epic fantasy affair. the story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel, and is thus quite predictable, lacking in complexity, and easy to lose interest in. but as so many animes have shown, a poor premise can be rescued by deep, realistic characters. sadly, no one rescues the story of inuyasha. kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical anime heroine (and far too reminiscent of akane, the main character of the original comic author's previous work ranma 1/2); she is kind to other females, but treats many males, especially her love interest, with unfair, unabashed, unjustifiable brutality. inuyasha is a tough-on-the-outside-but-sweet-on-the-inside type, and miroku is the lamentable stock character of "the pervert".the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - namely, nothing. despite constant action, the story does not progress. despite regular romantic moments, neither does the main relationship. despite ample time, the characters never really change. and to add a cherry to the sundae of mediocrity, all this stagnation is stretched into approximately 150 episodes.my final criticism of this anime is the animation. while certainly not ugly, it displays almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. the animators seem to take joy in long scenes of inuyasha jumping through the air with wind whistling in which they have little to do but move a background.in short, with all the beautiful animations of the world at one's keyboard-perched fingertips, there is absolutely no reason to watch inuyasha.

may or may not contain spoilers. inuyasha is not a good anime. it's actually very overrated. why? there's absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just drags on... and on... and on... that's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress. and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again. the same episodes seem to go with the same plot: kagome sensing a jewel shard, a worm/slime/tentacle demon thing pops up, inuyasha says "wind-scar", "iron reaver soul stealer", etc. and kills the demon, they get the jewel shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times.besides the repeating of episodes, there's the repeating of comedic devices, and they're not funny anymore. wait, they never were. sexual harassment is not funny. viz rated the series older teens, 16+. i have no idea why they rated it that. there's nothing bad about it except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is kind of suggestive, and that could get you arrested these days.now, this is how we know inuyasha is overrated. the videogames. they all sucked. especially the mask game. i played that at my friend's house. it wasn't anything interesting. the game was slow, boring, and it had nintendo 64 like graphics. in a magazine, it got a rating of 4/10, saying "...this role-playing game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw." then, there's all these stupid inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers, and coloring books. coloring books! we thought inuyasha was 16+! maybe not... but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn, about half the people on there were 10 to 13. i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all. (i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show, it could be shown on toonami.) there are over 40 manga volumes. i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them. sad...then there's the music. the music is so annoying. we hear the same 5 songs every episode. after 10 episodes, the music gets really annoying. in other anime, they have music to fit the mood and we don't hear some songs very often. there are about 15 different inuyasha soundtracks. don't waste your money on that garbage!and how do you think i know all this? because i used to be a fan of inuyasha. i feel ashamed of myself. i'd rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead. sadly, those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have...

rossini once described rival composer wagner's work as having "some wonderful moments...and some awful quarter-hours". inuyasha, it seems, can also be described this way. it has many great episodes, but in between them are countless filler episodes. the entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which i'd say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot (i didn't bother to count and i wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher, though).some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable, though many are quite silly or dull. nonetheless, the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series. character development, too, slows down greatly and by the later seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, resulting in increasingly stale jokes (particularly those concerning the monk, who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly).however, all of that isn't to say that inuyasha is a bad series. it just isn't a great series the way neon genesis evangelion, for example, is generally considered to be. as something to watch at the end of a hard day, it is nice, but it could never be confused with high art.

let me state this right from the start. i do not hate this show. i actually quite like some aspects of it. in fact, when i first started to watch it, i quickly became hooked. i was just starting to come out of the whole "anime is for kids" stereotype, and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued.unfortunately, after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films, i can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime. seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv. by the end, only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it.allow me to explain the plot for you. you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. kagome is an average high school student, who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine. when kagome comes out of the well again, she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan. she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge/justice/groping in one characters case =). overall, they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it.while there are many, many side stories and story arcs, there is no were near enough material to occupy 167 episodes. the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull (the band of seven). after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes. these episodes have little to no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. in some cases, some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. inuyasha shoots wind-scar at enemy. windscar deflects. characters gasp in horror. enemy turns out to have barrier. characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust. also **major spoiler: the conclusion will be revealed** the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours. **major spoiler over**the animation itself is above average, and in some cases excellent. even so, reused animation cells plague most action scenes, and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row.on the brighter side however, all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating. also, the character designs (appearences) were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen, particularly with the band of seven. there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here. even so, i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot. and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again. one particular joke (sit boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes.although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha.bottom line: definitely worth checking out, but not worth watching the whole series. the first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for anybody. but after that, it simply becomes dull and tedious. watching a tv show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series accomplishes just that. don't expect much from "inuyasha", because you will only feel let down.

oh man! this series has to be the worst possible anime i've ever seen in a while.it started out new, exciting and fresh. and i really liked it then. kagome was a good female role model for the show. and inu-yasha was funny and hot-headed.then, it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed... and i'll tell y'all the reasons why. (warning: spoiler alert!!)okay, they basically destroy inu-yasha's relationship with kagome early on, by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend, who's drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time.they introduce a pervert named miroku, who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show. (which really bugged me,'cause it was out of place and stupid.) then, they introduce a demon slayer named sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwashed brother.the big bad of the show, naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost his touch after a while. (he got pretty old pretty fast. and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything.)the characters all became wooden, and unemotional. and then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. nothing happened. naraku never got killed or defeated. kagome and inu-yasha never fully fell in love ('cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick.) plot holes were left open. the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. and nothing changed in the plot. (i mean,they dragged it out to over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot... at all.) and they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied?? i was disenchanted, disgusted, and annoyed as crap. i at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series. instead, all i got was a dragged out commercial for the manga.seriously, if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that, i strongly recommend "rurouni kenshin". that show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too.but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime, as best as you can.

will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters? okay "care" is about childabuse, "care" is about perverts misusing boys in a school and how disgusting it might be, if it's a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie. "care" is a movie that could have been, but is it because it was a tvmovie i don't know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some housewifes and fathers who decide not to go to bed. there are so many unanswered things in this movie...the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more. "care" should have been much much better.

the film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? it looks like the only winning bet for portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars, together with slang which otherwise, in the nowadays portuguese society, is repulsed with horror. if you watch advertising for portuguese films at portuguese tvs, they all have included a "hot" scene from the movie. i'm not saying, by any means, that portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. going back to the movie... there is nothing left from the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. the film could have been a good one, had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. it had almost all the ingredients... but the "chef" was awful...

as you might not know eça de queiroz is one of portugal's most rightfully celebrated writers. he was witty, he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb. and that's not due to this movie being bad, which it is, but as a result of the treatment dispensed to one of his masterworks "o crime do padre amaro". it's treated like cheap, throwaway trash.when it was publicized that this was to be a "modern and urban" take on the book i feared for the worst, normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty to take the p**** when doing an adaptation, to half arse it in the shoddiest possible way. and so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret,forbidden affair are substituted by extra-long passages of people dealing drugs and singing hip-hop for no particular or pertinent reason to the plot. it's just there like it might very well not have been.oh and there's lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on. remember how every movie in the 80's, no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity? if it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a felon he "happened" to be in bed with a woman that would prance around screaming (naked of course) when the cops barged in. ahem, gratuitous is the word i think. not that there's anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because there's nothing else to the movie, it's totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content.

i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very, very free adaptation from the work of eça de queiroz, and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters. the problem is the way that is done, without any care, without any taste, just a rumble of bad taste clichés everywhere. the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that's makes petty seeing nice actors as unas, bryner, morgado, lagarto and others, lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling. for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances, but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction. and talking about direction, this seems to be something totally missing on this moviewhere's the director? everything is bad taste; the frames are whatever, and whenever, the use of hand camera without any justified reason, the light design that should build environments doesn't exist (and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story). the problem overall in this "trying to be" film is that as no taste, or very, very bad taste. it's sad to see jorge and soraia melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes, painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives. maybe carlos coelho da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie.

i saw this film yesterday on tv. i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based. in the opening credits it said "this is a free adaptation of eça de queirós' novel". i should have turned off my tv at that moment.vera sacramento's idea of "free adaptation" is turning a story about church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex. in fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part, which was only mildly referred in eça de queirós' novel. and, of course, the name of some characters.as of the characters, in the novel, amélia and joão eduardo were victims of church's influence. amélia was seduced by father amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. joão eduardo, her fiancé, was excommungated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. in this movie, amélia seduces every one she meets and father amaro is just another victim. joão eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons.vera sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of (bad) sex. even worse, her story was completely empty of ideas. two wasted hours! eça de queirós surely did not deserve this.

i turned this off within the first five minutes. it's very sick and disturbing, the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it's skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument. this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died. the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously, it didn't. i don't agree with graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. i was very disappointed as i had just watched 'eyes without a face' which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached, which spoilt my night - as i couldn't hurt a fly, never mind watching this savage documentary.reading other reviews on this page, i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic - this is not art or beauty. i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.

well its ten year's on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit, again like the other comments made the aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog. middle class is not funny nor is rich. there is also a mish mash of cast. why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father, it escapes me. it's such a shame about this film, looks like a wonderful place to holiday thou. anyway its an hour and thirty mins of my life i will never be able to get back. lifes to short to watch this movie.

this appalling piece of tripe was (conveniently) loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine (played by jack thompson and jacqueline mackenzie).this film is offensive; besides the fact that it wasn't a particular good film anyway, it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the true-life tragedy.as for the director; he managed to cash in on a family's misfortune for the price of a porsche.if i could have given this a zero i would have.avoid this film at all costs.

the brief existence of the sex pistols and the making of this film after the controversial, groundbreaking english punk band's break-up both happened before i was born. however, i started listening to their only album, "never mind the b*&%@#&s, here's the sex pistols", in 2003, when i was a teenager, and quickly became a big fan. i didn't see "the great rock 'n' roll swindle" until 2006, but saw it a couple times that year, and thought it was pretty good (certainly not great, but pretty good), even if i could only remember bits of it, and didn't see how it all connected. seeing it a third time, nearly three years after the second, i didn't care much for it at all. i'm not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place (can't remember now).this film is a mockumentary, in which sex pistols manager malcolm mclaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members; guitarist steve jones, credited here as "the crook"; drummer paul cook, credited as "the tea-maker"; bassist sid vicious, credited as "the gimmick"; and john lydon (a.k.a. johnny rotten) credited as "the collaborator." mclaren claims that he created the band (and even the genre of punk rock) as a scam to make money. he tells much of the story to helen wellington-lloyd (a.k.a. helen of troy), in various places where they go together. it's basically a hodgepodge of mclaren talking, pistols songs, live footage of the band, fictional scenes (often silly, strange ones), several cartoon sequences, etc., all put together in one film, to tell the pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way!it has been well proved that mclaren is a liar, i know many have already pointed this out, including band members themselves. he was not the driving force of the band, he didn't create them (nor did he invent punk rock, and the sex pistols weren't even the first punk band, though they were unique). the band members were the ones who made the band what it was. "the filth and the fury", a much more believable film about the band from julien temple, who made this film, is told from the point of view of the band members, who contradict mclaren's claims. however, the dishonesty of "the great rock 'n' roll swindle" is not my biggest problem with it. if it were actually entertaining (which i used to think it was to a certain extent), i would be able to overlook that, like i obviously used to be able to do. during my third viewing, apart from sex pistols songs, some live footage, and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence, it was pretty dull! i found the "who killed bambi" song mildly amusing at first, but it got tiring very quickly.is this mockumentary worth watching for sex pistols fans? it seems a good number of fans would say it is, not to learn about the true story of the short-lived but groundbreaking 70's punk band, but for entertainment. that was once my opinion on "the great rock 'n' roll swindle". after the first time i watched it, i couldn't remember a thing mclaren said, and by the time i saw it the second time, i was aware of what the pistols manager was using this film to imply, but could still barely remember anything i heard him say! obviously, other aspects of the film were what i found impressive. now, after my third viewing, i can definitely remember some of the things mclaren says, but it still wasn't 100% clear. like most of the film, i guess his words are not that memorable, probably because of the way they're presented. if you're a pistols fan, i guess it wouldn't hurt to give "swindle" a try, but to me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent, boring mess that tries to be funny but fails.

from the epicenter of the cultural globe, four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion. it was the final attempt to do so last century, and they failed. before the dust had cleared, band manager and sex shop proprietor malcolm mclaren spent the money the sex pistols had earned to make a "mockumentary" about his own role in their success. the film was called the great rock 'n roll swindle (take the hint) and consists of very little footage of the sex pistols actually playing music, and quite a lot of footage of mclaren effectively calling the audience idiots.cod-surrealist nonsense in which guitarist steve jones is a detective on mclaren's tail, soon dissolves so he and drummer paul cook can jet off to rio and spend time with "great train robber" ronnie biggs. ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony-free version of "belsen was a gas" (a song about killing jews for gold in bergen-belsen concentration camp), and another song sung in ronnie's tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics "god save myra hindley, god save ian brady" (lyrics that johnny rotten would have considered distasteful). the sid vicious scenes are few and idiotic. jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the '50s. playing into to the "punk's a joke" theme of the movie, in an attempt to turn sid into james dean. i'm surprised mclaren doesn't take credit for siddy's death too. the redeeming scenes are those of sid in paris and the infamous performance of my way. the punk rock zeitgeist right there. mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all. no need for an entire film, just watch that clip on youtube.from julien temple's far superior (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary followup, the filth and the fury, we were given a more balanced/honest view of what transpired in '78. but there were also a number of scenes that i would have liked to have seen in swindle (as fury was basically a reediting of the same material). one was an animated sid complete with sid's voice acting; "you f*cken betta wat'ch out, alright, or i'll slice you open" - a still of which appeared on the cover of the something else 7 inch - a snippet was shown in fury, but i don't know what context that originally appeared. was it in original prints, but removed after sid's death? was there more? fury also shed light on the film who killed bambi, which would have been the mock hard day's night movie mclaren was originally intending to make. it starred sting(!) as a member of a gay new romantics group, and looked a damn sight more entertaining than swindle.sod swindle, t'is a swindle. if you must, rent the filth and the fury and revel in music's failure as a world changing polemic.

not only is the great rock n roll swindle thoroughly inaccurate, but when it comes down to it, not much about it is interesting or even entertaining. malcolm mclaren apparently squandered the majority of the sex pistols earnings on this waste of film, which makes it that much more obnoxious. the intention, from the beginning, was to create a monument to the "genius" of mclaren, who to this day takes full credit for creating punk music, creating the sex pistols, and at times even writing all the songs. viewers follow mclaren to various settings, where he tells his story to his sidekick, a female dwarf, and simply takes credit for one thing after another. one particularly irritating scene has mclaren in an abandoned airplane hangar, waiting for a plane, being hounded by reporters and giving them their "big story". the most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces, however, even these reek of mclaren's overbearing self-importance.even as a farce, this film doesn't work. little about it is entertaining, except for steve jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type person. 20 years later, julien temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the sex pistols documentary "the filth and the fury". while that movie is much better and more interesting than "swindle", it still is full of temple's "artistic flourishes" that just don't work, like interviewing band members in shadow, as if they are some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity. an interesting bit of trivia: film critic roger ebert was one of the original scriptwriters for the movie "who killed bambi?", which eventually became "swindle".

to this day, malcolm mclaren is telling anyone daft enough to believe him that the sex pistols were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money. there is a good reason for him doing this, namely that he is a liar.here are some real facts.* mclaren was actually approached by the band to be manager, not the other way round.* the pistols were a proper, organic band and not created by mclaren or anyone else. jones and cook were childhood friends. rotten and vicious went back a long way too. this is something that has led to unfair criticism of the pistols down the years as they have been likened to manufactured boy bands.* the band and no one else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created the publicity and gave the interviews.* mclaren did not instigate the bill grundy incident. the pistols only appeared on the programme because queen had pulled out. according to the band, mclaren was cowering in the back in case arrests were about to be made.* johnny rotten walked out of the band. he was not sacked.* far from outwitting the sex pistols, john lydon (rotten) actually successfully sued him in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money. some of the evidence used by lydon's lawyers was from mclaren's boasting in 'the great rock & roll swindle'. this would suggest that mclaren is none too bright despite his affectations.* the sackings and subsequent pay offs from a & m and emi were, again, not engineered, it was merely the way things panned out.* mclaren boasts about the money he made from the band. if he had been competent, he could have made a great deal more. it seems he coudn't even organise gigs properly.* mclaren's claim at the start of the film that he invented punk rock can be disproved in about ten seconds. the pistols were not the first punk band, merely the most high profile.this is a terrible film. the only parts worth watching are the genuine footage of the band, later put to much better use in 'the filth and the fury'.

i will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines, i'll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation, over acting, obvious tag lines these are some of it's good qualities. if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you got is this movie throw it to the fish. i can't tell you how much i'm sorry i saw this horrifying ghastly movie. speaking of which, this movie supposedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing capabilities of some of the actors.take care.

there is only way to describe this movie.so bad its hilarious.the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout. the male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure, i know this sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can't help but agree.the monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old sinbad movies.in short this movie is good for only one thing a really large laugh at how bad movies can get.if you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrongthis is the movie for you

the acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like they'd just got the script that morning) and the film and sound quality made me think of the 70s movie of the week bombs. the only thing that told me that it was indeed not a 70s movie of the week was the reference to dna testing. but for me, being eastern orthodox, the most egregious thing about this....film.....was the total romishness of the religion. romania is 88% orthodox but you'd never know that from this movie: father soren is irish. and i'd have known this even if i hadn't seen the actor play the irish pub keep, michael sullivan in star trek: voyager's "fairhaven" episodes. the bishop was wearing roman vestments (and for the record not even orthodox bishops wear their vestments unless they're saying the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). about the only non-romish paraphernalia i saw was the 3-bar cross on the door of the church, and even then i had to squint to see it. the first reviewer said the producers had done their research. well, if that's true they messed up on the religious aspect of the film.

this movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed. it's like all of the porn stars that didn't want to fulfill their obligations banded together around this awful, trite, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence.this is a helpful movie if you're in the mood to torture a loved (or no longer loved) one. it's important that, if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture, that you put in earplugs and put on a blindfold to keep yourself from going insane.if i had a choice between this movie and the 700 club...i'd choose girls gone wild.overall, better if you've been drinking. but only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.

gargoyle starts late one night in 'romania 1532' as a peasant girl (daniela nane) travels along in her horse & cart minding her own business when from the moonlit clouds above a living gargoyle swoops down & attacks her, she manages to escape the gargoyle & happens upon a castle of some description where an angry mob of local villagers & a priest are able to put an end to the gargoyle, or so they think... cut to present day bucharest where two cia agents ty griffin (michael pare) & jennifer wells (sandra hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich american ambassador from his kidnappers. in pursuit of one of the kidnappers griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood & no visible signs of what happened to him. meanwhile dr. christina durant (kate orsini) & her colleague richard barrier (jason rohrer) are renovating a church when the church labourer gregor (mihai bisericanu) informs richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate & find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons & one very angry & very much alive gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both. griffin & wells are on the case when they are reported missing & soon realise that local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named father soren (fintan mckeown) planning to flood the world with them...co-written, co-produced & directed by jim wynorski under his usual pseudonym jay andrews gargoyles is yet another masterpiece wynorski can add to his credits, not. the script by wynorski, ion ionescu, a.g. lawrence & bill munroe is crap, is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. for a start i would like to know if there was only one gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because i'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. how did it survive in that hole for 500 years? what did it eat? how did the priest know it was there? why has no one else ever figured it out? why did the priest want to flood the world with them? to rule it? the gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? much like the guys who wrote gargoyle i don't think he thought it through that well did he? whichever way i look at it, whichever way i approach it, from whichever angle i try to figure it out from, no matter how many times i try to square the circle gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. the character's are dull & clichéd, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. people do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince griffin that gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. the cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. the bit on the large ferris wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.director wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from gargoyle is a car chase through bucharest but it was taken from the jean-claude van damme action film maximum risk (1996). there are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. the special effects are terrible, the cgi gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. there isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the romanian locations look suitably romanian. gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. the acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim michael pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. a total waste of 90 minutes as far as i'm concerned, one to avoid.

you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? that's a great metaphor for this movie. i kept watching, even though it was really difficult. but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. i should have spit it out when i had the chance.the premise is corny enough to be fun. for the first time in like a thousand years, gargoyles have returned to romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. it's up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok. unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles.in the end, this movie feels like a poor man's van helsing. if you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary monday night. i gave it 3 out of 10 stars.

this is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors try to shove too much drama into a movie that's not dramatic at all. like in the beginning, the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand, then shot that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later--no sense whatsoever.the only thing worse than the plot line is the cgi, which would be greatly rivaled by a homemade flash movie. the actors look like they're doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70's robots; the dialogue makes so little sense it's not funny.many things just happen with no explanation as to how or why, such as a lady suddenly wandering around a zoo that had shut down hours ago. and when she sees this thing flying towards her, her first reaction is to take a picture, rather than what she does a full ten minutes later---power-walking (not even running) like her life depended on it--which, obviously, it doesn't.overall, not recommended. makes me wish they still did new episodes of mst3k.

i don't think i'm spoiling anyone's experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do, like clean under the stove. it gets dirty under there and you've gotta clean it sometime. i think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence, though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. "gargoyle"'s heart is in the right place, but its aspirations are conservative. it is at least not pretentious. but i had a great time acting in it, playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie who says "what's down this hole?" and dies for his hubris. plus i got to meet michael pare. every film junkie should work with a b-movie staple at least once before death. and romanians are the loveliest people i've met. literally the loveliest. walk down the street in bucarest: if 7 of every 10 women aren't absolutely beautiful, you're walking down a street i didn't come across; and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks.part of the film was shot in casa radio, an abandoned, unfinished classic communist bloc-cum-georgian nightmare edifice originally intended to house kgb propaganda ministries, i.e. radio not-so-free europe. the building's five stories tall and takes up a city block; best of all, while its facade radiates big brotheresque state solidity, it resides near the city center like a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp peopled by dozens of gypsies and scores of wild dogs. construction on casa radio was suspended when caucescu and his wife were executed on tv in 1989, and still there are gaping holes that drop from the sun-baked top floor (offering surreal vistas of a modern quarter-mile stretch of concrete roof, decorated with jutting rebar and old car parts, overlooking a crumbling ancient city) all the way down to the damp, creepy sub-basement (which doubles in the film for the gargoyle lair.) no american-style guardrails or warning signs for bucarest. since the demise of the soviet union, casa radio has hosted several non-union film shoots, including "highlander iii". it is attractive to producers because it's a cheap location, massive in terms of scale and available space, bizarre looking, and free of insurance headaches as it's still state property. plus no one complains if you don't clean up after your production: anything left onsite is interpolated into the resident gypsies' construction of their shanty town in this actual urban jungle. an assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog during the shoot of "gargoyle". the apples provided by catering were pressed into service by cast and crew as projectiles in order to keep the prowling dogs at bay. i too was bitten by wild dogs in bucarest, once in a bar (!) and once in a city park. i also survived two car wrecks in two weeks, both in taxis and neither of which was seen by the drivers involved as grounds for stopping the cars.geek note: the sci-fi network or channel or whatever was one of the backers of this film (the smaller the budget, the more producers on set), so it's a little weird that nobody had a problem with the original title, "gargoyles", until it was almost time to show it on the network, even though sci-fi already had an unrelated series of that name. the title was changed sometime relatively close to release, as i have a color-corrected copy labeled with the former title.

going into teaching mrs tingle, all i wanted was a fun, enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time. despite a rather good first half hour, the film quickly subsides into a dull, clichéd mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers. rusty pliers, at that. 'scream' writer kevin williamson wrote and directed this movie, and proved that scream may well have been a fluke. most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream, due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute; here, it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas. the plot follows the cleverest girl in school, played by katie holmes. after being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home. however, this isn't just any teacher; it's mrs tingle, the meanest bitch in school. she isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other.the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'suicide kings', and a whole host of earlier films. it's actually not a bad idea for a movie, and if williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. the character of mrs tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she's massively one dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. the acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of helen mirren in the title role. she's suitably evil in the role, and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure. the teenage cast isn't worth mentioning, with only katie holmes standing out; and that's only really because of her star profile, not her acting talents. williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music, which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway. honestly, this movie does have a few moments that are rather good; but basically, if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy - this isn't the movie that you want to see.

ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (mirren) just to prevent her action against them. interesting premise could render a good movie but this one is just lame and far fetched. boring with an ending embarassing, just to say the least. mrs. mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire but even she - a good actress, no doubt about it - could save this garbage. i give this a 4 (four).

bank heist / cop thriller sounds ok right?chaos looks good: nicely framed, good production values, high concept action heist... but...the plot has the unique achievement of being both smart and incredidly, blatantly implausible in the "how we actually got the money" mode and overcomplicated in the "who done it and why" section at the same time...in addtion, ryan philippe shouting is not, seriously not either tough or scary...and he is especially not tough or scary when throwing a tizzy fit. honestly, his great outburst is the only really funny scene in the whole film. must make him thrilled that he turned down the role of anakin skywalker and is now doing this.... stratham is normally good as the tough but silent hard nut with the self-deprecating humor, but here, the extra relationship lines are so laughably bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the clichéd mush required. more silent seems best? snipes is actually ok in a typecast way, but another nail in a talented actor's coffin: he needs an actor's role not an action hero rehash. perhaps that business with his taxes will allow him to break that mold and the public and critics will let him on the sympathy vote. it would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time.the lines these guys speak when they're not doing the plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word.... pheeeuuuh.the film feels all out of whack and it never gels: i found it irritating for the first 45 minutes, and the tighter last part was passable. it should /could have been good but it just can't redeem the awful lines, the overwhelming score, and the general level of irritation with the levels of plausibility. overall i nearly didn't make it through: incredibly irritating, and ryan.... please, please, please get rid of the goldilocks....

the film "chaos" takes its name from gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie "chaos"? nothing. the film makers seem to have skimmed the book (obviously without understanding a thing about it) looking for a "theme" to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film. in this respect, the movie "choas" resembles the canadian effort "cube," in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed: in "cube" a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes: the same approach is taken in "chaos": disconnected extracts from gleick's books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever. this, of course, is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience, and any literate viewer of "chaos" who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered. how could a film so bad be made? rewritten as a novel, the story in "chaos" would probably not even make it past a literary agent's secretary's desk. how could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film? regarding what's in the movie, every performance is phoned in. save for technical glitches, it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene. the story is uniformly senseless: the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight-year-old. among other massive shortcomings are the following: the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow. he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints. police officers do not carry or use radios. dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy. let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film. if there is any other movie you like (or even simply do not hate) watch that instead.

i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. in other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. howsoever, at the end i realized that mr. tony giglio was earnest about this movie. it's a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! poor ryan phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! what to say for jason statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... for this reasons i vote: 3/10

obvious tailored vehicle for ryan philippe. it seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like he's eternally 16 (he can't).heavyweights jason statham and welsey snipes serve as bookends to phillippe, but when they're not on the screen phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.the script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s tv cop shows, such as "the streets of san francisco." snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain, playing a slightly less crazed madman than his demolition man role. however, there wasn't much for snipes and statham to chew on. statham's character announces he'd given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.truly forgettable moment: ryan phillippe expounding on buddhist dogma: galloway: are you a buddhist? dekker: no. it's just something i picked up along the way.

i went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, chaos is terrible. this movie has absolutely nothing going for it - it should not have been made.don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers, cause i'm going to address a lot of plot-holes here.first of all - the opening scene. it's the great big event that made the two semi-lead characters (statham and snipes) turn crooked. but it's boring and mundane. only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you won't care anymore. also - this whole event, where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as referred to in the movie.then the bank job - it doesn't get off the ground for any second. the bank robber makes some un-needed references to chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story, by the way). the way statham gets summoned is very 'die hard with a vengeance', but more boring. then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless. -what's with the safety deposit box. there seems to be some plot unfolding there, but then, it doesn't. -why go through the trouble of stringing up two people, when it leads to nothing? it involves a lot of preparation and it's used for nothing at all! -why doesn't the swat leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down?and this is only the first 10 minutes. it keeps getting worse and worse. -the whole romantic / love interest story (with the 'he wasn't just a better cop, he was a better man' remark to finish it of) is painful to watch. it's just pointless -why would statham's character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank. this essentially leads to finding the 'virus' that will get him all the money. -why go through the trouble of forging some guys signature and killing him, but then not kill the guy that can identify you.i could go on for ages (really), but it's like this movie is... pointless. the whole script is a mess. the 'smart' references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic. the plot 'twists' can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time. it is really painful to watch a movie like this, where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn crunching people, of which the director hopes they won't see all the plot holes and the over-all ridiculous script. the 'explanation scene' at the end only adds to insult. it is really, really not a good movie. in any way.people who come to see an action film don't get what they come for. people who come to see a cop-buddy movie don't get it. people who come to see a smart thriller don't get that. in essence, everyone gets the same - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. do yourself a favor and skip this one.

seeing the names of the starring actors (statham, snipes and phillippe) i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting. instead all i got from it was not just boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen, and hearing tons of lame and shabby "bad cop" phrases.the main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to begin with. and when you have that, than no one can help you, not statham, not wesley snipes...not even john mcclane could save this movie :-) it could be cool for the kids, if they aren't over 12 years of age, because they don't care so much about the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.

those people,who told me"this movie is good"-shame on them!this film is for an audience,who has no problem to watch everything{especially when it's all about tough guys,guns,chasing&heists}.i 'd compare this movie with"the inside man"{the same loss of time}. i'm tired of copy and paste movies.and i'm discontented,but what can i do?fans of that types of movies are much more.... if you want to watch good movie from that type ,i will recommend to you "lucky number slevin". i'm not mean, i just dislike this movie{weak actors,weak script,weak action}.probably someone else will like it.many people-many tastes.however for me"chaos"is tasteless!

frankly i'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews. i'll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan phillippe, and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor, though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990's indicated.as far as action/suspense movies go, this movie fails in nearly every respect. the acting is ok, i guess, but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense, a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory, as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually 'clever' - but then again, judging from other reviews, some were. don't be fooled: the script is a boring, derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it. wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film, and statham is a thoroughly dull actor.not recommended.

this is the award that made me lose all respects for the hugos.if such a "distinguished" panel can't see or care about the obvious story-telling problems of battlestar galactica, then what worth is their award? the answer: not much.award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, neither of which are in evidence in bg, in this episode or any other that i've seen.shooting in drab video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. shaking the camera is not "creative" it's vomit-inducing and lazy as can be.all bg has shown is how corrupt most award-giving "academies" really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of pr money.

it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing, and it was very predictable: i mean, we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal, and i'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end.not worth watching. it's sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career: kane, ambersons, and a touch of evil.

one of the last surviving horror screen greats - conrad radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great conrad greeting you as you visit. unfortunately for him and his captors, conrad's body is "borrowed" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with and at him, and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs. news of the missing body reaches radzoff's widow and her friend(who happens to be proficient in the black arts) and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings conrad back to life so he can, in his own words, get "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." well, frightmare is an interesting "bad" film. sure, it is cheap. the sets look like they were borrowed(which i am sure they were). the special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility. the acting is average to below average with a few exceptions. jeffrey combs of re-animator fame is in tow, but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks. none of the "kids" except the pretty girl playing meg is any good. nita talbot plays the "friend" of the radzoffs with withering interest. also, look for the big - i mean big - guy that plays the policeman. that is porky himself of porkys fame. but thankfully for all of us, one performance does rise above the material. ferdy mayne, an oft overlooked actor from germany who had christopher lee features and did star as a vampire in the fearless vampire killers, does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. conrad radzoff in a bad human being in life, living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead(obviously none of the swinging teens at that point). mayne is able to look very regal, speak very elegantly, and convey menace with ease. if for no other reason, one should see frightmare for his performance. i do; however, believe that when they showed black and white clips of radzoff that they used christopher lee footage(anyone have any thoughts?). anyway, one can guess what happens and it does indeed: radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace. again, the formula is trite and overused. the acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous. but mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude. definitely worth a little peek. watching mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time.

conrad radzoff(ferdy mayne), a hammy cult icon, dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and tv commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults). his body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to "invite him to dinner"..they are quite big fans). what these kids(..including a young jeffrey combs)don't expect is that radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest.the list of violent acts include radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face, decapitates one fellow, and cremates another guy alive in a coffin. a really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around radzoff's ghoulish activities.silly hokum from troma is limited by a very, very low budget and slowwwwww pace. the film feels a lot longer than it is. the film isn't really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark. at times, radzoff is an ominous presence, yet at other times he just looks real silly.

island of death is not really a good movie, by any standard, but it is a curious one. imagine if natural born killers had been made 20 years too early, as a greek eurotrash porn film. that's what you get here - the quaint story of a young, sociopathic british couple cutting a deadly swath through the population of a lovely little greek island.i'll spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot; it's not really important except to set up increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes followed by disturbingly brutal murders, often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple. it could have been brilliant, in its own sick and nasty way, but instead...instead, i found myself impatiently checking the run time and chapter index to see how much longer the parade was going to last. sluggish pacing and listless, bland acting turn even vilest perversities into pablum, and connecting scenes into an eternity of dull plodding. ah, well. you can't win 'em all.

director nico mastorakis has made a cynical cash-grabber (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan.the most extreme, confronting genre pics, to paraphrase a character in videodrome, "have a philosophy"; that is what makes them dangerous.island of death's philosophy is to throw many "shocking" elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly. the result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance.not to be confused with serrador's brilliant who could kill a child? (sometimes called island of death), mastorakis's effort is set on a greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion.everything moves at a snailish pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed.touted as "the movie that the censors didn't want you to see", i'd hazard a guess that the censors never saw it, they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked upwards.

how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie? the lack of script is one thing, but the cinematography makes you want to weep. a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it's of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden. it would be a shame for the industry if he (or any in the team for that matter) is given money to make a film ever again. this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year.

i saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can't believe that this is sweden's official submission to the 79th academy awards to be considered for best foreign film. producer anna anthony last year also had sweden's official submission for best foreign film with zozo. i wasn't personally a fan of zozo but at least it had some production value to it. this could have been shot as a high school film project. as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it's characters. this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood. actually falkenberg isn't like some remote northern swedish village. it's a popular summer resort with a population of city and townships of almost 40,000 and lies between two major southern coastal swedish cities of götborg and malmo. the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more. they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with adulthood. if they want to stay in falkenberg forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding bicycles, drinking, smoking pot and occasionally painting a house. maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends, of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn't make sense. jesper ganslandt makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer, of which i use the term loosely, fredrik wenzel. the acting isn't too bad. i would give this a 4.5 out of 10 but despite it's submission for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it.

this is an admirable attempt from first time filmmaker ham tran, offering little-glanced perspective dealing with vietnam war victims struggling for liberation, but plays out as a glorified history special. with clunky, self-consciously informative dialog and sub-par acting, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not spring to life this sagging, albeit historically worthy, melodrama. paying no mind to the often distracting disconnect with the actors to the reality of situations on screen, and you should be left with an informative, if somewhat impersonal educational lesson in vietnamese post-war history.

(chances are, i'm gonna spoil valuable plot points while writing this and because i can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point, then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things, then i suggest you hop right on to the next review.) you know, i don't mind the cult films being filed under the "cult" section. and people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the "reality". i mean, is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo-christian propaganda films be filed with the other special interest movies? i couldn't have been more flabbergasted had pat robertson made a porn movie. (or would that be "flubbergasted"?) it was bad enough that there was an egregiously insufficient count of kicking and punching in this. it was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways. it was bad enough that it wasn't filed under special interest, with other cult films. it was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being "realistic" as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the "debbil" and the really profound and nasty evil isn't done by human beings -- usually in the name of religions based on the god of abraham. it was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful.no, the really bad part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off, and declared "i for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now, just to get that out of my head. preferably both, if you have it." and we had just met her.

my friends and i are always on the lookout for chuck norris films to just bash and make fun of. one of our favorites so far is lonewolf. i went to a wal-mart christmas shopping and i came across this movie in the 5.99 bin. i had to get it. i had high hopes for this movie and although being absolutely hilarious at times, we agreed that bells of innocence is the worst movie we've ever seen, made, produced, thought up, etc... who the hell would think this is a good idea. not only is it confusing at times, but the acting is just hard to watch. the man who plays oren has acting i can compare to my own vomit, and chuck took a dive on this one, he's not the greatest actor, but this was terrible. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux........ jux. come on people. if you honestly thought this movie was at all watchable, great for you because it was hard for me and i seriously had a headache and stomach pains after watching it. i'm telling you now if you haven't seen this movie, don't!!. for the love of god please do not subject yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life.

this is another one of those fundamentalist christian movies that hit you over the head with religion like a sledgehammer. you know you are in trouble when the setup of the story is completely ridiculous. three men are flying to mexico to deliver bibles. this makes no sense since the church is protestant and most mexicans are catholic. protestant and catholic bibles are not the same. the catholic bible has books in it that are not in the protestant bible. i also find it difficult to believe that churches in mexico would not distribute bibles to them. i can understand if they were going to a place where christianity is in the minority. but mexico is far fetched. if you cannot believe the setup of a story, then you don't the rest of the story either. a movie about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.

boring, rank nefarious plot, some of the worst direction i've ever come across, inane acting and horribly clichéd. the movie ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream. what's with that? even jr from dallas couldn't survive that lame twist. you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl, which is ostensibly meant to be fatherly, but which comes off as perverse. you have freshman community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of the kimberly hole. this is like children of the corn meets passion of the christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video - by the end of it, if you aren't contemplating ending it, you have no brain.don't bother.

when you watch the making of with this dvd - they tell you what is attempted here- they are retelling the bible story of good versus evil & trying to preach it to a main stream movie audience. in a modern society such as ours, this is where the film fails. there are way too many sheep depicted in this movie. people are too empowered for this type of preaching today.as far as the acting, directing, & technical functions, they are done ok. chuck norris actually is ok as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of norris as an angel is no more absurd than tommy smothers was in the 1960's sit com.

ok, chuck norris has shown up in many an entertaining movie over the years. this is not one of them. i won't even bother trying to get into the plot about a bible shipment gone wrong. the "acting" of the main characters is so wood like, pinocchio would have done a better job! the synthesizer based soundtrack is even worse than the one in deathstalker. whereas traditionally low budget spooky movies are often trying to catch their audience by adding plenty of graphic violence, this one is trying to catch an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbo at the spectator. the plot boils down to different versions of the bible.

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. what were they thinking. stop preaching to me already! this is why all of us watch walker texas ranger and wont admit it to our friends. terrible acting and a extremely phony plot. while the movie is unfolding the story stops and the actors start preaching to the audience. the director somehow believed the two meshed well. it looked like crap! when i saw the title at my local blockbusters it looked interesting. their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action / adventure. first time in a long time i stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate finishing it.

normally, i don't like chuck norris films. i appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his fight scenes are usually fairly well-choreographed. chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats. so, in my local used bookstore, i found a film i hadn't seen before and took it home.while the acting in this movie was worse than most chuch norris films, i was hoping to see at least one fight scene. i quickly began to realize that this wasn't a typical chuch norris film; rather it was a christian film, destined to illustrate the "good will win out" paradigm.there is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film, with the exception of the label ... goodtimes entertainment, which i had never heard of before. i'll certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that company.i don't have a problem with christianity ... i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing. if someone is going to make a religious film, at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get. the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only $3.25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight. at least it was during supper-time, and i spent some of that cooking and eating.in short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film, and not hoping for much, don't bother with this film because it doesn't even offer that.

ok, i'm 26 so i've been thru all the action heroes 80's hype, and chuck norris along with seagal, van damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of bullets from one round only;) i saw the advert of this movie on tv a couple of days ago - chuck norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. whoa! 'that is a must-see crappy movie!', i said. and indeed it was. only a lot lot worse. it is very difficult to see all the movie - stuffed with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, who serve satan, all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community, which represent whole mankind - it is a load of christian fundamentalist's wet dreams.i've nothing against christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, c'mon, chuck norris playing an angel, whose job is to look after little town, where satan lives?!?! the whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning its silliness (yes, it's not stupidity anymore, we're talking silliness like... like a retarded child's joke) make altogether terrible movie, made as far as i suppose for elder people very much devoted to catholic church, because young viewers laugh at almost every scene. technically it's incorrect, the fx are worse than the ones you've seen in early 90's in tv series, the plot seems very stupid, actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands, not mentioning the music which as far as i've heard was played on a childish toy piano. i've seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (the ones from the imdb bottom list) like 'space mutiny' or 'manos - hands of fate' but believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly acted quasi-movie which brings some students' prank movies to my mind rather than regular production. avoid it. at all cost avoid it. there's even nothing to laugh at. chuck norris has officially finished his movie career.

i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris. this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research, and find out as much as i could about the man. i later find out that he is not in fact a man, but an angel sent from heaven. with a face like that, who could ever doubt it? i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should. i am proud to say that bells of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list. i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local wal-mart without the receipt, which i had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue. the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it, but his son mike. i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old can't-act-his-way-out-of-a-wet-paper-bag block. i came to the conclusion a long while ago; the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason. the only character he ever plays is himself, chuck norris. no matter what movie, no matter what situation, he is always chuck norris. the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent. mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter, he seems to be extremely happy! maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic, as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time. his actions confused me throughout the film, making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was. the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris. the guy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the direct-to-video screen. the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie, was an episode of walker texas ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. maybe chuck owes this guy something. the other guy, which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable, was your average christian fanatic. i don't have anything against christians, in fact i am one, but this guy was just too much for me. to round out the story, you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people "friend", and a couple of villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge. not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies. all in all, the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time, on more levels than chuck norris can kick people's asses. despite being one of the worst actors of all time, i still can't get enough of chuck. maybe he really was sent from heaven...

i don't get it! the teenage leads in "horror star" supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol (conrad radzoff) passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. that doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it? i'm a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price, peter cushing and boris karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. no wonder conrad comes back from the dead  admittedly, after a séance  to wipe them all off the face of the earth! mr. radzoff already wasn't known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets. "horror star" (a.k.a. "frightmare" and "body snatchers") is a pretty lame 80's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy. the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one  not even a film school student  is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through. conrad's video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive. one teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (jeffrey combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence. in the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin. writer/director norman thaddeus vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister. the locations and scenery are great, but vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job. the acting performances are overall decent, with ferdy mayne (imitating christopher lee) and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles. "horror star" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film, but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of enthusiastically made b-horror.

get shorty was an excellent film. it was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. be cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. john travolta as chili palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. he plays it like he's a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a shylock. uma thurman, great in nearly every role she's ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? the chemistry between her and travolta is strained and uncomfortable. other than that, just add every movie cliché you can think of. a well-educated rap producer by cedric the entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in christina milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in vince vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by stephen tyler. the only funny part was the rock, who invents his own new cliché as a gay samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. probably the biggest crime is the plot: it makes no sense. get shorty was clever with chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. but this film tries that with about a million different characters. and even chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. fans of get shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.

blindingly stupid guff from the formerly talented john hughes, who'll soon be making a film with the sperm from 'look who's talking' if his stars get any younger. he recycles the 'home alone' formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy, in which a baby makes his way around chicago while inept kidnappers joe mantegna, joe pantoliano and brian haley try to catch him, along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick. if mantegna and pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie then you're in trouble, but the laziness of the movie is most glaring in the scenes where crowds of people fail to notice a baby crawling around on the pavement. utter nonsense.

this was painful! recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper, this british-belgian co-production from 1977 (could've fooled me, it looks ten years older than that at least) is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half-hour mark, consider yourself a trouper. the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst, which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn't really there. harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i've seen, with the obligatory 'trippy' moments (especially where the animation of the brainiac-type subtracto character is involved) that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated. the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored. as for adults, stick to jonathan swift's original novel.

peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film "on her majesty's secret service" (considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series). other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like "gold" and "shout at the devil", both adapted from wilbur smith novels. "gulliver's travels" is an odd one on his list of films; it seems strange that a director of hunt's style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind. a half-live action/half-animated retelling of jonathan swift's classic satire, the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made, and in all honesty it simply doesn't work. and there's not a damn thing that hunt (with his usual eye for fast-paced action), or star richard harris (who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles) can do to rescue this one.lemuel gulliver (richard harris) is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol. his father (norman shelley) wants him to go to london to make his fortune; but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called the 'antelope'. during a voyage, the 'antelope' is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef. the ship sinks and everyone is lost, apart from gulliver. who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of lilliput. when he comes round, gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans, no taller than his toe. to them, he looks like a giant. they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island. but gulliver doesn't like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation, so he makes plans to escape.harris is left to carry the entire film here. his first couple of scenes involve other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in lilliput he spends the rest of the film striding over knee-high sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts. the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but it certainly hadn't been done a lot. a few disney movies like song of the south, so dear to my heart and pete's dragon had tampered with the idea, but it was still pretty much in its infancy. "gulliver's travels" is not an especially well-animated film, but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon co-stars are at least competently done. occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins (there's one scene where we learn that lilliput has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs !?! - and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things). but at its heart, this is very much a kids' film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon. everyone involved has done better things during their career  "gulliver's travels" might fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience.

i have to agree with the other two comments. i waited over a month to see this great new show a&e had been hyping. what a disappointment!!! the show is pretty much all about ryan buell. his voice-overs are campy, not creepy. it sounds as if he is talking into a can. as of the second episode, which is roughly 30 minutes or so (if you take out the commercials) he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic. he can't say the name, anytime someone needs to convey that name, they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else. not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. why can't he say the name?...supposedly it would give the demon more power. funny, i always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. if you know the exact name of the demon, doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out. now the next episode, which airs in just a little while is titled "exorcism". so is ryan in need of an exorcism already? not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything. i can tell ryan that if i were a small child, hell if i was an adult, and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me, i would look elsewhere for help!!! besides which, if you don't use holy water & blessings, etc. in the right way don't you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you? i will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time i watch it!

i suppose i should be fair and point out that i don't believe in ghosts. that said, i'm very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy. i am a fan of ghost hunters because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific angle. even early episodes of most haunted had a camp entertainment factor to them. paranormal state has neither of these qualities. the cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality tv" these days, it suffers from overproduction, poor acting and silly scripts. the makers of the show freely admit that writers "guide" the stories. i hear they are even going to shoehorn in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic. the show has many other flaws too. as others have stated, the narration quickly becomes like nails down a chalkboard. over the top visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating. i'm willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vendetta" story arc is just ridiculous. given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain dead fodder like mtv's laguna beach and newport harbor i suppose this is really no surprise. if you are a die hard fan of ed & lorraine warren or a big "reality" show junkie i guess you'll find much to like in paranormal state. for the rest of us....i recommend you avoid.

i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows. from the cheesy mockumentaries like discovery channel's "the haunting" to scooby doo reality shows like "ghost hunters". when i saw promos for a&e's "paranormal state" i knew i was going to watch. especially when "paranormal state" was juxtaposed against a weak monday night football game.by the end of the pilot of "paranormal state" when the main "character" in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he, too, had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that "came out of the closet" and the (catholic) church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot.the shtick behind "paranormal state" is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club. or society. or super adventure club. and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m. night shymalan movie.the "they" is kind of a misnomer. really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show. he is often accompanied on "investigations" by hot co-eds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera. hey, are they ghosts too? this is ryan buell's show. paranormal state is his "vehicle" as we like to say in the biz. and, oh, what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be.did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star date-less "director's log" voice over? almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas, but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs. seriously, every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game.the "investigations" -- the plot that each episode revolves around -- are interesting on the surface. no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in "paranormal state". this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear. small children are harassed, things loom in the dark, voices encourage the living to kill, and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands. of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent, nasty hauntings tied to violent, nasty deaths. maybe.maybe not. everything in "paranormal state" is short-handed into half hour, "dog the bounty -- er, ghost hunter" blocks. every time there is an interesting, verifiable shred of evidence -- the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s -- the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander. at least with sci-fi channel's "ghost hunters" there is a somewhat over-exhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer. evps that could be a rat farting, cold spots in a drafty house, and "orbs" that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust. it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes "ghost hunters" ... almost believable.whereas "paranormal state" claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio. yep, see, an evp, right? people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement... well, we will just go and see about that... while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room. ryan, the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates, is claiming to see "visions" of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting... but he can't tell us, the audience, or his team of gothed out undergrads, because... he can't. you never say a demon's name out loud, ryan informs the wide eyed co-ed who dare inquires.well, how very very convenient for you. especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind."paranormal state" is all turn and no prestige. the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people. not even grainy video of a chair moving, or a black blob running between prison cells. nothing. you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over.if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little. if you are trying to sway me, show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer. and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode."paranormal state" is weak sauce. not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time, or just have that thin of a dvd collection. or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water.

okay, sure, this film will never win an oscar. citizen cane this film is not... but why does every film have to be scrutinized? when was the last time you saw a film that was funny not becuase it was good, but because it was goofy? doesn't anyone remember roger corman, king of exploitation?well, i had fun. i liked the cheese. just go in not expecting to think, and prepare to throw popcorn at the screen.

like another ticket buyer i saw a nice cute poster about this film, it's five star review, and awards won. thought what the heck, let's by a ticket for myself and my two sons. bad idea. the movie was not a family film, it was gratuitous, and it contained nothing worth watching.

why???? what a disgusting joke of a supposed movie...from the poster it looked like a cute movie.. what a disappointment.. who the heck is the male lead? he looks like an old retarded retired reject cop... i am a cop and i can tell.. the man can't act... go back to being a cop..no screen presence.. why did they show his bare ass so, as if he is mel gibson,, hell no... put the filmmaker out of business.. this guy has no business making a movie... i seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive... whoever cast the film is a no talent hack who cast no talent hacks in the lead.. it's great that us white guys are alway getting the asian women but why an ugly white guy why not dean cain or brad pitt as the white boyfriend.. why to asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what i see??? don't get it.. must be low self esteem..the only hot girl who can act in the movie was the kate holliday..why was there one hot white chick among all the rest of the ugly asian chicks who think they are hot and can act???only two actors in this movie the host of the poetry at the end of the movie and the one hot white chick in the massage house.. tl young and kate holliday should have been the leads in the movie..the asia character was ridiculous looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto/sexy black girl...key word here is "trying"..gina.. you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role.. you need to play character roles and be more humble in your self presentation..i think the actress is gina hirazumi... i looked her up on the imdb and she is a great asian actress???? if that is the case i don't want to see what the bad asian american actresses are... no wonder hollywood doesn't have asian american actors!!! if this is the best they got!!! they were supposedly winning some kind of asian film award?? give me break...it looked like they just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of asian girls in them.. they aren't even hot..gina...you are not hot.. stop trying..play character roles and improve your acting..you are not a leading female type...if this movies makes money pigs can fly..sorry for being so blunt but i feel that these actors/ actresses need to either get better or work on their craft: for the exception of the two actors i mentioned who should have played the leads.. i say this in love for all the asian lead girls in the film please do what your parents say and go and be doctors/lawyers/and engineers...and do acting on the side for fun..hopefully that is what you are doing now.. i am not trying to be mean but hoping this will be read and push you people to either get better or go do another business.. there was not even a message ethically in this movie..i would not be surprised if "soap girls" was secretly funded by members of the ku klux klan special department of asian american hate propaganda of the klan.. otherwise asian people must hate themselves..seeing this film makes me as the viewer grateful that i am not asian..you folks are pathetic..have some self respect you asian people.

1983's "frightmare" is an odd little film. the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s/'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding '80s slasher genre. it isn't totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late german actor ferdinand mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala vincent price) named "conrad ratzoff." at the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. just when you think he couldn't be any more un-likable, the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. nice, huh? conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. still feisty even at death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad's grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in an '80s horror film. logic has no place here.) the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad's body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. in the meantime, mrs. ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband's body, has called in a psychic friend to try and "reach" conrad through a seance. you can pretty much figure out the rest from here. since conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life, it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any friendlier in death. psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one. this is where the movie falls apart. endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying "hello? is anyone there?" are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (way later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again, we're in an '80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.i can't really recommend "frightmare" to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s. "modern horror" fans will doubtlessly find "frightmare" incredibly slow moving and goofy. if you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from "frightmare." fans of jeffrey ("re-animator") combs may also want to check it out, as the future dr. west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label (paired with roy ward's "vault of horror" and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. i'm told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma, which seems appropriate. if you're a troma kind of person then "frightmare" will be right up your alley.

i thought maybe... maybe this could be good. an early appearance by the re-animator (jeffery combs); many homage's to old horror movies; the troma label on the front this movie could be a gem! i thought wrong.frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half assed homage to the fright films of yore. the story is an old one, young people breaking into a house, getting drunk, making love, and tampering with things that shouldn't be tampered with. the oft  recycled slasher film formula is used here, this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing. in fact, the performance by the radzoff's actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. he does the snooty dracula style character very well. but as for the kids, its not so good, with combs only having a minimal part.the film lacks entertainment value, and only features one cool character, and one or two scenes that can hold your attention. i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch, and this is the only movie left at blockbuster.

this is a parody. that means, there are no characters as such, they are all plain stereotypes, and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes.well, there are quite some good jokes in this movie. unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones. if one expects all dialogues to be absurd, the fun wears off.you see, there is american pie 2, my all time favorite teenager movie. it contains a lot of real original characters. maybe the jokes are tasteless, but all the people have some kind of live. for example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny !not so this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, so there are no characters at all, therefore there is really no room for any sympathy. too, if you know the original movies, you know whole scenes in advance. add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie.the only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where i was watching the film.ah, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of melissa joan hart in one scene. sigh. she is just too cool, she can't be real. hmm, worth a whole movie ?

this is a stupid movie. like a lot of these karate movies it is badly written, awkward, and sometimes just stupid. the action really isn't all there and the movie overall leaves much to be desired. everyone here is talking jive, doing bad karate and doing a very bad job of acting. watch for scatman crothers in a small role, he is too good for this movie overall. jim kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. gloria hendry is real bad. all of them are, there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense. the supposed love/running away scene with hendry and kelly, what the hell was that? they destroyed that man's guitar, for no reason! and then there was the mandatory girls on trampolines!!! now what was that? they were in the movie for five seconds, then you never heard from them again!!! then there is the whole racially charged element of the movie, which is cool and all, but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere. like i said, this is good for a laugh one time, but don't watch it again.

another try, another miss. france may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie. i mean... the least they could do was to shoot the movie in the forest of brocéliande, but even the forest is fake ! it was shot near paris ! the subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf. nothing could save it.bad... to the bone. i wasn't warned. i want my money back.

yes, absolutely dreadful, and this coming from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. i enjoy all sorts of horror/suspense films, and have seen some wonderful work from european film makers. broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film-making. the camera work is worse than amateurish. not the fashionable, shaky mtv "cameraman needs ritalin" type of camera work so many film-makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. this is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. the acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. the dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror/suspense film delving into pseudo-mysticism. i think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. these were bad to the point of being ludicrous. i've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. this was just bad film-making. very, very sad.

what should i say? i only saw this flick for curiosity, and this is truly a shame... i grew up in brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent 5 years in rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place... shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in rennes. they could at least have chosen a likely town, or a likely forest, but nothing even seem like brittany nor rennes... and calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience. besides those details, it could have been a good film, but it's crap. silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. definitely to avoid.

i hate this movie!!!!!! i have never seen such utter, complete trash in my life!!! i live in france so it turned out that i was in the front line to watch this awful movie. at first, it seemed cool, kind of like something about a cursed forest that chomps people. unfortunately, it turned out it was something quite different: a good start with a girl that meets a guy and all that whatnot, then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of ravens shut up in her bathroom closet(ludicrous), from that bit and on, the movie starts to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate thrashing in the process. the movie ends with sacrificial druids galore and ancient ugly, stinky creatures coming back from the past to kill a few people. many questions were rushing around my head by then: why the heck did they bring back that scummy monster? do druids look like maniacs dressed in bedsheets? why did they even bother making this movie?? the "climax" of the movie was so goofy i laughed all the way through it: the "awful" stinky monster does battle with the two young women(who appear to be expert kung fu masters) and the professor gets sliced in two or something. what surprised me was that the monster was so slow and ungainly in battle, wasn't it supposed to be a god of war or something? anyway, the movie in it's death throws was a pitiful sight. a brief condensation of the contents of this movie: kung fu mayhem+druid stones+mysterious murders "à la thriller"+ancient prophecies+shabby ravens+old clumsy boneless war god+nutty professor=complete and utter, diseased, boneless, worm eaten, godforsaken, goddam, recycled, fake, wannabe, ludicrous sh*t!!!!!!!!! things i learned from this movie: -ancient war gods are lousy at kung fu. -all young women who study archeology at university in france are kung fu experts. -professors are so resistant they can survive being sliced in two by a saw-mass-whatchamacallit without any injuries.

after a few misfires, we are still waiting for the french horror movie that the critics will certainly vilify, but will launch a new trend. not this time. doug headline can't be accused of not being knowledgable in the genre (he is editor of a high-class fantasy imprint, has worked for legendary magazine starfix.), but why a scenario that uses every cliché in the book (except maybe the odious comic relief) ? why make it so predictable ? even the nods towards argento fails flat. it's not even an euro-teen movie like the german "anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features lots of plot holes. the whole "celtic" aspect is barely touched. and, after a "revenation" painfully predictable, the screenplay offers us a boring, endless chase in a subterranean necropole which seems bigger than parisian catacombs. i really wanted to love this film. really. but even a mother would not. oh, and writer valerio evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo, but i vainly looked for him.

the actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, quite ok. apart from this, there is nothing to save from this movie. incredibly bad acted, dumb to tears dialogues, all-too-expected plot, a lot of goofs and inconsistencies (for instance, a pretty young girl gets hits in the head by a morning star and not only she survives, but barely with a scratch !)... to make it short because it does not worth more, even the fans of the genre can avoid it.

in the early 00's, production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after "the crimson rivers" and "brotherhood of the wolf" turned out to be hits, so several movies were green-lit or saved from their "direct-to-video" fate. however, france, as opposed to the us, uk or italy, has little tradition of fantasy b-movies and it turned out quickly that "samouraïs", "bloody mallory" or the "crimson rivers" sequel were ill-advised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place. as they flopped, producers have gone back to their usual fare: derivative farces or the umpteenth self-referential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from "les cahiers du cinéma"."brocéliande" could only have been green-lit during this short window, as it serves no other discernible purpose. it's your by-the-book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you'll find bimboesque female characters, a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before, even before the movie started.these elements make all the fun of a 70's or a 80's b-movie and you expect them in a 70's or 80's movie. however, we're not in the 80's anymore and nobody warned director doug headline, as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie. headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80's but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "brocéliande" a bore.when you put together clichés from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino, you get a "scream" or a "death proof", movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clichés and add a great deal to them. that's called "talent" and that's why you can't confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago."brocéliande" takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies (unfortunately for the male viewer, the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing). there are very strong similarities (presumably unintentional) between the plot of "brocéliande" and the reviled "halloween 3: season of the witch", as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night. as even the plot of "halloween 3" makes more sense than this one, it means that something seriously wrong went with "brocéliande".

really!here the french cinema hits rock bottom ,and compared to it, the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies,the likes of "friday the thirteenth" "freddy" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art.it's all the more infuriating as there were exciting original elements :the forêt de brocéliande and its legends ,the druids and king arthur ,all were splendid assets for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film.alas! filmed ,as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest,near paris ,the movie is fake horror,fake celtic history,fake vestiges -you should see the professor (wilms who was a wonderful m.le quesnoy in "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille) scream for the "invaluable scrap" -which the production probably bought in a dime store-fake characters ,fake excavations...the boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny ;so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts.and what can we say of the professors? of the monster? a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce.to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer!word to the wise:maurice leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his arsene lupin saga called "l'île aux trente cercueils" .a miniseries was made 30 years ago.avoid this "broceliande" garbage and try to see it instead.

i really wanted to like this movie, because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of everyday horror movie clones, and i appreciate that the filmmakers are trying for something original. unfortunately, the plot just didn't hold together and none of the characters were likable enough for me to really care about them or their fates.visually, the toybox was pretty interesting. the director took a lot of somewhat risky moves, like adding in little bits of (flash-looking) animation in parts and really cheesing up some of the special effects (such as the light from a certain amulet). sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't, but he deserves kudos for the attempt, and the cinematography was generally of high quality.unfortunately, when this same approach of throwing lots of things at the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot, the results were not very good. the film never really finds a tone that it likes, moving schizophrenically from black comedy to family soap opera to 80's witchcraft flick to childhood nostalgia to embattled-family slasher. taken on their own, bits and pieces of each of these elements work fairly well, but nothing ever coheres into a satisfying whole. besides that, large bits of the plot are never really explained. i'm not one who likes to have everything spoon-fed to me, and i like movies that leave things up to the audience to decide, but the parts that are left out from the toybox just seem like they either ran out of money before they could explain them or they didn't really think things through to begin with.i look forward to the director's next project, since i think there is a lot of talent lurking under the surface here, but i can't really recommend the toybox on its own merits.

this show should be titled, "when bad writing happens to good actors" considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues, e.g. andre braugher in homicide: life on the street and david morse in st. elsewhere. i'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd i wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be. we're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out, almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel, sentenced to redeem himself from sins, both venial and mortal, via butting into his cab fares many affairs. watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief, that mike olshanskey's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers. that he possesses those "super-cop" abilities, to be all things to all people, weapons expert, martial arts master, psychologist, father-confessor, locksmith, and so on, ad infinitum. pure drivelesque fantasy. what is it about recent televisions shows based in philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child? overdone. i wanted to like this show, really i did, because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors. but i'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution.

if you think hannah montana or the suite life are at the bottom of tween sitcoms then you've obviously never watched icarly. icarly is without a doubt the worst show i've ever seen. from the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show reeks of cheapness like last week's chinese takeout left to simmer in your overheated car.the show revolves around a pretty, perky, and "supposed to be" funny girl named carly, as she and her friends make a live web show called icarly. carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some counseling or something, because he's a few cells short of a brain.the plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and unbearably annoying. but having to watch carly and her friend, sam, do their little icarly show-within-in-a-show is even worse. they basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laugh-track plays over and over. i mean seriously, every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reason.so, what's the point of this review? you may ask. just to ridicule icarly? well, yeah, but i'm also warning you to beware of this show. because seriously, if i had to choose between watching icarly and barney? no questions about it, i'd choose barney.

i... no words. no words can describe this. i will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their toasters... after watching this show.this... cosgrove person... her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly agitated insects. perhaps i exaggerate. however, i have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show.the characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week. though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets, i have no doubt that it will happen eventually.the main plot of this *belches loudly into the faces of the actors* is that of a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly web-cast on the creatively titled icarly.com with her brainless friends, one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn't afford. her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother.i haven't watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer, or perhaps a cold, but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator, the doorman of the apartment almost dieing, and the world's fattest priest coming for a visit. no, really.avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma. if you do decide to watch it, laugh when the laugh-track tells you to, as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers.

...and that's saying something. no matter how bad a movie gets, i'm normally able to sit through it so i can judge the full movie. through this one, i made it about 20 minutes.maybe it was the dvd, or maybe it was my laptop, but i could not hear the dialogue, even with the volume turned all the way up. sound effects were fine, so with the volume turned up to hear the dialogue, i was blowing out my eardrums with the effects. as much as i wanted to see this thing through, i wasn't going to sacrifice my hearing for it.from what little i could tell about the plot, the movie was one big flashback by the main character's daughter. it seems the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because the one person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemy and now he is pursuing her across a desert planet.the only thing i liked about the movie was the look of the main character; there was something i liked about her hairstyle.oh well, looks like this one is going into the dumpster...

first i have to say that i don't like since fiction movies at all so much! but there are some movies i liked really. this is one of the others ;) i've the same opinion like some (most)others here. the film is still going on in my back, but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time....i think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with 3 suns and 4 moons, but its the only i liked. there are no intelligent dialogs (are there???). but its a great film for everybody who loves lara croft or some other girls in hot-pants... ;)for the directors: " stop to try again, please!!!

i'd never heard of zero budget "auteur" neil johnson before seeing "battlespace" on dvd at hollywood video. a few minutes into the movie i realize this isn't a bad thing. like many straight to video sci-fi movies, this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that fail to create a story.viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter. to me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis. some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it's seemingly new age messages hook line and sinker. these favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like "battlefield earth" was a brilliant movie, or that shasta is just as good as coke.those who were lured in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses, spaced with long blocks of people not talking), rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses), and irritating talking computers. what you won't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue, or a good story."battlespace" is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it. real science fiction, hell, real film-making, is about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. this is right down there with similar direct to video sci-fi like "cl.one" and "recon 2022". if the boredom of "strange horizons" and "alien visitor" is something you seek out, by all means, watch the crap out of this. if you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.

i watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. so, i fast forward all the way through the end. this movie must be the worst of all in the low budget sci-fi movies category so far. bad acting, cast, directions, lara craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! through out the entire movie, i think that there maybe only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but only two of them started in the entire movie. i was expecting something like the starship trooper, but it was nothing close to it. i was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the dvd cover. don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. come to think of it, i wonder why did they even bother to put out bad movies like this one?

i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film. no plot, very limited action, and what is with the 3rd person commentary throughout the film???? instead of running around the planet to shoot on all of these locations, they should have spent some money on script writing and actors. what acting there was, was lousy. this was 90 minutes of my life i will never be able to get back. i should bill the director for the cost of renting this film. to the director and the writers of this film....please quit now. this film should have a tag on the front of it saying beware of boredom. the only good thing i can say about this film, is the computer generation. it's ok as generation is. this movie should never have a sequel....ever.

this movie was rented for free, i had no misconception about this being a very bad movie. i rented it for thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches an awful movie. so you ask, what makes this movie so bad you gave it only 2 stars? dialog. the lack of dialog makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience. in fact if you rent this, just turn the volume down to zero and pop in any heavy metal cd from your favorite artist. i know you will enjoy it better. the plot of this holiday turkey was so encumbered with tech and geek speak you need a translator for the narrative. now for all you people who enjoy good sci-fi effects... eh, they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse. the actors, um both of them, are not much to look at either. they say nothing much through out the entire movie. many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero straps herself to a missile and fires it at the city 70km away (it never showed how she landed). the scene before that we see a robotic sentry fire at her with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses multiple shots. also we are told that the political division between the antagonist and protagonist is bio-tech (genetically enhanced humans) vs cyber-tech (machine enhanced humans) but both seem to be cyborgs or enhanced humans. what told me this was a bad movie at the rental store was the cover that looked like a video game cover art and there was only the one copy, good new releases have many copies available.

i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie. oh well, had fun making fun of the endless sand trudging, eating camel dung (well, actually eggplant) and weird grimacing acting from i think it was about five actors. the dvd needs a director's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking...or if he was at all. i can't believe they actually went to england, austrialia and wherever to film this...could have been done anywhere. would have been better if they had managed to get her naked. the best line of the movie? "he waiting for his upgrades." "yup, still waiting". now that was funny! if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog (beyond the narrator....shut up already) then i'll watch it again.

the film begins with a 30 minute explanation about the war, the human cyborgs, battles, history, and then dumps 2 actors into a gravel pit. they run around this gravel pit/desert area for about an hour shooting at each other. that's it. must have cost about £10.00 to make, with change. avoid.marks out of ten: acting -9 sets 1 costumes -9 direction -50 production 1 titled intro 4i think to improve this film would be to: lose the commentary. (let the watcher decide what's going on). remove some of the awful cgi. add some techno rave music to it. they might just rescue it.......

ok, please believe me when i say that this is a terrible, terrible, sci-fi movie. its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as unintentional surrealism and its absolutely a 100% waste of time. awful, but somehow also deeply unfunny. i watched this as a double feature with "recon 2020: the caprini massacre" and although "battlespace" was an incredibly superior film, that's not saying much. the plot of "battlespace" is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow. the narration is cryptic, often nonsensical, seemingly endless, and thoroughly exhausting. literally half the film is duplicative scenes of the female lead, who looks like brian bosworth, walking through the desert. the movie actually starts out pretty cool, but then nosedives into pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. absolutely horrible and truly an absurdist endurance test. zero stars. ---|--- reviews by flak magnet

let me break down this film for you...the first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects. i'm not one to nitpick about special effects, but what you've got to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you shouldn't anchor your film around special effects. starships fire blobs of color at each other, flaring into stock explosions, and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers. you will have no idea what is happening. it will not make sense.the second act involves a woman walking in the desert. at this point you will be treated to drab scenery, and illogical, boring fight scenes. nobody speaks. nothing interesting happens. the protagonist's goals are unclear, and are not very compelling. this goes on for about 45 minutes.then in a five-minute montage, she sneaks into an enemy base, straps herself to a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies.none of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.in the last twenty minutes, basically the chick's memories get transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of mankind. after this, we see the first, and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. you know. because when the universe is collapsing, you get to decide if you want to be a part of it.she chooses yes. but the memories of mankind survive in a capsule. maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? if you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. the lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind-up toy capable of staying right-side-up while walking through sand. all of the story is told through painfully dull narration.the film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas. there are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films, but as it stands, it's bloated with completely irrelevant details. two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage. instead, the narrator fills in a novella's worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters.there are good ideas in here, but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained. people watched films to be entertained. this film does not entertain.

in a world where humans can live forever you spend the entire movie wishing they would die. first off if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on mute, don't worry you miss a plot, hell they don't even talk for the first 70 min of an 87 min movie, after putting on mute you must now hit fast forward till the main chick dies don't worry even if your paying attention you won't know why or how she died. once you get to the "good part" take it of mute. oh, how will you know the good part, wait for an elevator scene with two morons in space suits with wwii weapons. these weapons won't seem like much till you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag pistol and a bandoleer of co2 cartridges. the only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick who looks like she was attacked by wolverine. after listening to the "plot", you will wish they went back to not talking. of the four people that are in this movie none of them can remotely act, not even a little bit, you will have better luck witnessing acting at a kindergarten theater.to comment on the special on the special effects, let me just say "wow", no really you will spend the entire movie saying to your self "where did this movie's 1.8 million dollar budget go!" seriously it will leave you in aw of the magnitude of ineptness. the best "sets" are basically windows wallpaper backgrounds. the ships are basically flying wrenches, wait some are barges that kinda look like whales . i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life. they have buttons on their wrist(large pedometers) that can put them in "fight mode" and super runing mode (makes them super blurry). this will seriously drain their power reserves but they find bits of wires to chew on to regain their strength. the explosions were less impressive than my fourth of july, i only had sparklers.so the plot as far as i can figure goes something like this "mother" is a space ship captain and goes to the desert for a while rides a rocket dies. then her daughter 6000 years in the future ( no i am not exaggerating) recalls her mother's memories through some sort of capsule. anyways they jabber on for another 10 min and then the cause a big bang. yes the same "big bang" that started our solar system. it's explained how she goes back in time or something, it does not really matter it happened i guess. roll credits seriously the whole script was mercifully on one sheet of paper, unless that actually detailed any of the dreadfully fight scenes.after watching the credits i have now laughed more than i did the entire movie, the jobs the created like catering supervisor "galactius sarcophagus" and then the special thanks to george lucas was just the best.i really wasn't expecting that much for a movie i paid 99 cents for but seriously some body owes me for this. most frequent comment heard after the movie "i want my life back". you have to admire that some but put time and effort in to this movie but seriously, why ?

you see a movie titled 'battlespace', what are you going to think? space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other. what do you get with this movie? well, you do get some space battle goodness, but for a great majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. no one talks!!!! what is this nonsense?! we get a narrators, and a ton of british computers, but thats about it. the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen, as she doesn't even have any dialog, and sleepwalks though scenes (literately!). some of the things happening are just stupid, like they use a rocket (like to go to space) for basic transportation planet side, why not just use one of those nifty space ships? in any case, the music is almost non-existent, with a few boring dull lifeless samples, but the main thing you will notice is the atari sound effects the ships use...you have got to be kidding me. i can also tell that the budget was low, because everything looks fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. i seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad, making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is. i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had, because their is very little here (if you can't tell already that is my main gripe here, as i probably said that like 3 times already).

today i had a real craving for a sci-fi movie and so i decided to check out battlespace. sadly, that was one of my biggest mistakes this year.i see that the director, neil johnson, has directed over 500 music videos, and i suggest he goes back to that. music videos are a perfectly good form of entertainment, and not everybody can cut it making movies.the worst part of this movie is probably the voice over. and that says a lot since the special effects are appalling at times. voice over didn't work in blade runner, and it doesn't work here. the first hour or so is spent watching the main character walk through the desert, while her daughter tells the story. i think the story could have made a great movie, but not like this.the second worst part are the effects. they are simply bad and they don't blend into the rest of the picture at all, so you simply don't believe in them. and absolutely all the frames in the movie has been filtered, and not in a good way. filtering used as an effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad.and what is it with all the gadgets talking all the time, and not shutting up!?!? if i had used technology like that i would have gone mad. i was just waiting for the guns to blurt out with: "i am awfully sorry, but i seem to have run out of ammunition." no, stay away. this movie is just not worth the time.

i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci-fi movie, but this was almost intolerable. while a few of the special effects are very cool (landscapes) this is no 'battlespace' rather a disjointed weird mother/daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts thrown in. the acting (wooden), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with "hand-to-hand" combat scenes funnier than any hong kong chopsocky movie, this film bores. the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. save your love of sci-fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.

i made it through half of this, but was not enough of a masochist to see it all. the first half of the film had next to no dialog ! almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story. the scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over. at the same time he forgot to do any character development. most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other. there are some good things going on in the film. the soundtrack was well done. some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.

so it's a space movie. but it's low budget. you ask, "what about the effects?" the effects are at times good, and at times really, really bad. i mean bad. and notice i started with the effects.there's a story here, but it's told in what i think is the wrong order. i don't mean a tarantino style wrong order. i mean, it's told in a completely nonsensical arrangement. most of it's about a mother (in the future, because you know, it's sci-fi) as told by her daughter, which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughter's perspective. only once you're through the first hour and hear paul darrow's voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he'd read it. this narrative is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hour.there's also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers: if you're not doing 2001 and want to have some action (this one does), then please hire a good fight choreographer. otherwise, your fights will look like, well, what's in battlespace. and notice the title has the word "battle" in it. ugh.i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. and some effects. my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as costing $1.8 million. when you compare it to something like primer, which did better with a budget of a few thousand, you realize in low budget film-making, it's all about the story. i wasn't expecting much - but i was still disappointed. two out of ten stars.

normally,i would say i loved this movie.not for acting,although that was ok.not for the script,which was so-so.the reason i would have normally loved this movie is for the intense action,which starts from the get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll.but,the problem with this movie,and i felt it was a big problem,was the horrible cgi.it looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effects shots. a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughest form.since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish the movie,they should not have released it.i actual found the effects insulting.it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent end product for the consumer.if it weren't for that,i would give this movie a much higher rating.my vote for air panic is a 3/10

it amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this. really. let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality... most of the movies today are based on other movies' stories, so a "simple" lack of originality is not that big a deal. but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this. because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. to be sincere i think a 6-years-old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. some examples following.the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like "ok, push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard". now, those are not buttons. they should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. that's something only plane-addicted would know, you say? wrong. the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the "buttons"... and of course the so called "buttons" don't move at all! not even a single millimeter! (and note that i haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine, that you just turn the key and the magic happens... you have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on...) come on guys! you could have faked the movements at least!! not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway (light poles along the runway? what where they thinking?!)... and the wings don't even get ripped off! it happened to me too, once... except the plane was made of lego! what about the flight attendant? she's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are, in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. should we mention, then, the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? and how did he turn the other airplane engines on?really, i could go on hours with this stuff. this is the dumbest movie i've ever come across, and i'm including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list. want to do yourself a favor? don't watch it.

i rented this movie because i love kristanna loken and i've watched her on many tv shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new t3 movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been in.she's just ok in terms of acting. not good and not bad either. she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous. yummmmmrodney rowland was quite a surprise as the hero. he provided the only solid good acting in the movie. he's a very good actor and should probably be an action star.besides kristanna being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest form.a computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something. and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game.this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick.what's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the september 11th tragedies.why do they make movies like this in the first place?panic * - one star (a waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as air panic)

generally speaking i don't make negative comments on here. but since this is a festival piece, i don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again.i thought the actors were pretty bad. for instance, they totally didn't play off each other, rather, they waited to recite their lines which were pretty poor to begin with. the dialogue sounded really forced. norman or whatever his name tried, or so it would appear, to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short.after words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all "yea", and he all but called them liars. look there were so many clues, the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $500 an hour whore. i mean the john gave her at least 20g's... tell tale sign. now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred, i for one, didn't even care. i was just glad to get out of there. i asked him which draft he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15.3 cause this needed a lot of work.but he seemed like a fairly nice guy, he is making his own films, he'll probably get better and i hope he does, not in a snotty way either, i mean it, i wish him luck. just remember, this is just my opinion.

it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie. i have to say it is really hard to make a good and/or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money. also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus. first, the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit, second you got a stick, third using computers to control rudders/elevators/aileron via "fly by wire". when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was "don't fly with computerized airplanes like airbus, use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and rudders."all i can say: bad story, horrible acting (most of the actors), worst film trick ever...

this movie has every cliché of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie.however, it is not entirely unwatchable, thanks to good performances by rowland, loken and smallwood (and maybe enberg).what is amazingly bad, though, is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes. boy, oh boy, the cgi scenes in "the last starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). the feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine.a pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.

it`s funny how instinct warns you of something . for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was . maybe i`m psychic ?!!!! mild spoilers !!!!the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . i don`t know about you but i`m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it`s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? yeah he`s a serious badass mofo . in fact he`s so bad ( and i don`t mean the acting - i`ll get to that in a moment ) that he`s impossible to take seriously and this is before he`s executed only to return as elton john , elvis , a french chef etc . i wonder if keith david got paid for this ? because he looks lke he`s having so much fun on screen that`s the only reason he`s playing the role . what a pity this reviewer didn`t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury . hey maybe the producers could send me keith`s fee ? gawd only knows i deserve it.i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn`t guessed and my main beef isn`t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . if like me you`ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you`ll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but judge and jury will have you believe that if you`re thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you`ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . it could of course be argued that any film starring sly , arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain

return to frogtown was a hard film to track down. well, i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while. wish it was kept that way! first, sam hell is of course not roddy piper. he is replaced by a dude with a large face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft-spoken for the part! sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. here, he gets captured three times! what kind of a hero is that?! spangle is replaced as well here by another actress. why did we not get different characters here? this was stupid! lou ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero. common sense says let lou be the hero of the film! bad effects, poor acting, and just a forgettable film. funny as they take shots at ninja turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. at least ninja turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! i really wanted to like return to frogtown, but i just cringed when the fight scenes would commence. this film makes turtles 3 look like gold! avoid this or you will be the one singing "meaner, greener, talking turtle tv dinner!"

the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like "miner's massacre" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and a couple of embarrassing performances. somebody forgot to tell the writers that "fool's gold" refers to the genuineness of the gold, not the people who are looking for it. 3/10

director and fx man john carl buechler doesn't have to do much in order to terrify me; the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart.his lamentable straight-to-video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop; twenty years later, and his dvds occupy the same space. it seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. you can rely on old jcb to serve up dreck, whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie-making technology.in this contemptible offering, a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of jeremiah stone, aka the forty-nineran evil, claim-jumping, cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid-1800s. before his death, jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold, and it's not long before the pick-axe wielding killer is back, bumping off the hapless treasure seekers.with its dreadful script, unimpressive make-up effects and scooby-doo style villain, 'the curse of the forty-niner' is par for the course for buechler. only genre stalwarts keren black, richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever, with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful (although i'll forgive alexandra ford, who is a complete hottie).even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on, and a lot of the deaths occur off-screen (which is probably not such a bad thing since the on-screen deaths are pathetic).'the curse of the forty-niner' is another in a long list of duds for john carl.

this was bad enough. i really hope that there is no sequel. maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility, but no, it really isn't.there is really not at all special about this movie. well, the special effect were fairly good, but nothing to write home about.there were some hot babes in her, especially elina madison and alexandra ford, but nothing to see folks. pg-13, definitely not an r. that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual.tame scare fare.

and believe me that's a pretty stunning accomplishment. take "jolly roger: massacre at cutter's cove," change the killer from a pirate to a prospector, change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold, and his color from puke green to deep blue. you now have "miner's massacre." the problem is, at least "jolly roger" was entertaining enough -- albeit in a so-bad-it's-good way -- to keep you watching it for the whole two hours. there's no strip-joint-murder scene or any bizarre killings. i can't tell you how many times i lost interest in "miner's massacre" and started doing dishes or cleaning around the condo. and, the ending is absolutely silly. the 49er dude just randomly re-appears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff, while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriff's cruiser, screaming. a truly horrible movie.

certainly expected more after seeing the cast list, but wow!i think a first time director could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like john buechler made it, puzzles me to no end. somehow, the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of d-list actors, whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half. the unknown actors were just plain awful, less steve wastell who does a decent job as axl. the story is so bad, that it really needs no mention. the overall production value seems standard, with some above average camera work, if you can make it through the god-awful "slo-mo" scenes and the painful "person on fire" sequences. i knew it would be dumb, i just had no idea how dumb, and unfortunately it's time spent that can never be returned to me. i suppose if you enjoy really bad "b" films, this might work for you, but if you value any story at all, this one is simply dreadful... a complete waste of time.

this movie made my face hurt. i don't understand it...things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number. i don't understand how people can laud this film with praise. there are b-movies, and then there are b-musicals, and then there is rockula.the songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video, which eases the pain, yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist. the most frightening section of the film is toni basil's creep-dance that accompanies her weird song. but on the bright side, she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for, unlike pop music sensations rockula (aka rapula) and mona...wow, can we say tone deaf. so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, see this film. if you hate your life, then buy it.

if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love bug' was daft, wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel. dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally; this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race, a lancia driven by julie sommars. by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'herbie rides again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast's frantic mugging.

even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease, after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968, the house of mouse cashed in with herbie rides again, herbie goes to monte carlo, and herbie goes bananas. neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of the love bug back in 68, in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick wheely applegate, entering herbie in the monte carlo rally. naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and herbie falls in love with another car!. the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. still you get to see herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4/10.

in the last few years of ron miller's (son-in-law of walt disney cum producer) reign he churned out live-action crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones, whose entire career was based on that kind of light, empty-headed fare. other horrible films from that same period include pete's dragon, the last flight of noah's ark, unidentified flying oddball and the dreaded condorman. i'll not mention tron because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it, so he had little to do with the actual production. however he was in full force when this god-awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity. herbie goes to monte carlo. second sequel to much- loved love bug tale finds herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. there's a race, some lame bad guys, a diamond and barney fife. shot in france, the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely. but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france. the rest of film is a wreck. prat falls, bumbling thieves, wicked german racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. the biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop herbie's lover personality via shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old, disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little vw. then again i would think it'd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing.

sadly, this movie did have potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud, as it did here. also, i don't think i've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh, but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery. the last time i was this stunned at how un-funny a comedy can be was with the awful "big momma's house." scene after scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly. silly and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer. an absolute, rock-bottom dud.

if a movie has an unimaginative, hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really, really funny. you can get away with a lot if you're funny. but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in grandma's boy, they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance.the movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone. when alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does. the movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them.the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. the game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy. but don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games.the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of j.p. j.p. is i think more-or-less conspired by the creator of doom, john carmack. at least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games.in the movie, j.p. is a weird, obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers. that makes no sense at all. if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as j.p. is supposed to be) then even if you're quirky and obnoxious, people will still admire and respect you on some level. if stephen hawking is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make jun of him to his face.also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as j.p., but in the movie they are basically frat boys. it's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie. and while that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a game company. if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one. unless you're a hack.about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up. something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. and i realized i hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. so i stopped (although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clichés, which they did).normally if a movie's bad i just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe.shame on the movie for luring a good actress like linda cardellini into it, then surrounding her with talentless nobodies. i'll give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the anti-shirley partridge though.

i can laugh at just about anything, but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb!!!!i honestly watched this movie from beginning to end, and did not even crack a smile. i am shocked that sandler, schneider, spade etc., would put their names on this piece of crap. worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players. what more can i say? how could such tasteless, extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent!! maybe i have lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time. what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back.

i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler "happy madison" production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. i realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. the acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. overall i was very unimpressed with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it.

that snarl...that scowl...the acts of random violence...the gutteral voice...the fetish wear...that shaven head...it can mean only one thing...grace jones is back!actually my sources tell me that the title role in blade wasn't played by the 1980s diva, but by wesley snipes.all in all this is not an improvement.blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic, two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions.the plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre, in fact, much like nosferatu, it seems to suck the life out of the audience. in brief, upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by blade, half-human, half-vampire, all annoying. it all climaxes with blade being put in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful cgi since 1968.blade has to be the least empathic character since dolph lundgren's punisher (also a comic adaptation, perhaps there is a trend here?). surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the 'hero'? and whilst a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not true of blade, he is relentlessly cruel, scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys.i assume that wesley snipes has an 'acting' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably. as he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put blade in the grave. as a piece of narcissism, blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh snipes for no reason whatsoever. likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of steven dorff *can* act, but they have to play second fiddle to snipes' tedious performance.kris kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel. and what happens when blade finds out? yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair.why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house? they always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had albert speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. a lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements. the rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again.to finish, there *is* a grace jones vampire movie, it's called vamp and it's about ten times better than this.

this movie has no plot. it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big pot party at grandma's house. the climax of the movie didn't even relate to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end. i can see how it could have related to the supposed story - that grandma's vg skills redeem him - but that just wasn't there. however, the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes. "her pussy smells like the great depression" "he just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours" "it's for you...i think it's the devil"

alright, how someone can actually think this movie is awesome, is so beyond me... i can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character it has going for it, is the evil super nerd game designer, and that gets old after a while. this movie is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny they're forced, you see better acting at the red light district, and the story sucks it's so predictable, you know exactly what's going to happen. even the characters do not react like they should, try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're banging 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time, her response wouldn't be (smile) "ok let's get back to work". i didn't laugh once during this movie, and i wish i had never seen it or spent 3$ to rent it because that's not even worth it. adam sandler produced this movie, i have lost all respect for him. all his movies are the same, his comedy style got old ever since the waterboy came out, if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented it...there's no way i would have wasted my time on it. this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect... ace ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie, it didn't have a killer plot...but it was original and it was hilarious. i'm not knocking the movie because it has 'low-level' humor, i'm knocking it because it sucks, it's a piece of hollywood crap. if this movie was presented to a production company and din't have "adam sandler" behind it, it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom. if you want a good movie about pot-culture watch cheech and chong, or whitecastle. if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14-17 year olds, with loud rock music at every possible cut, acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn, and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. don't do it.... for the love of god...this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind it.....hercules in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen, but it's actually so bad it's good. this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much, if not more.

first of all, i'd like to say that i really enjoyed this movie. however, that said, i can't say that it was a "good" movie. i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations (something i've learned to do). i'm glad i did, because the plot and development wasn't stellar. the jokes were low-grade humor. but, i was in the right mindset to enjoy them.i wasn't the only one. in fact, the entire theatre was laughing out loud. i didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close. i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing! but again, i have to warn you, grandma's boy is not a top-quality film. it is a funny (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. oh, and don't take kids to it.

call me old fashioned, but i like movies with plots. i thought "stoner comedy" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high. "grandma's boy," however, has decided this is a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached. apparently, allen covert (star and producer) and the happy madison gang were right, but that doesn't make "grandma's boy" any less boring and unfunny. they might be completely stoned -- but the characters are mostly half-baked.alex (covert, a longtime supporting player for adam sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted. he could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. after trying a couple friends, he ends up living with good ole grandma lilly (doris roberts of "everybody loves raymond"). she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline.like most people, alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both. his friends/co-workers all do the same thing. most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games. they're all awkward and all with the exception of nick swardson and joel moore (only at times) their characters aren't funny. funny if you're blazed ... sure, i suppose, but i can't say from experience.maybe all we loser guys like is getting high, playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film. neither should old women getting high on accident (saw that one coming) or being the but of gross-out sex jokes -- but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything. no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot, alex trying to get the hot girl (linda cardellini) to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline.characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but aside from a lovable doris roberts, the aforementioned swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moore's skill at making robot noises, there's little character ingenuity. covert is a run-of-the-mill main character with no comedic dimensions, his dealer friend dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and jonah hill and kevin nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter.if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness, "grandma's boy" will likely be just what you're looking for. those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected. the most i can say for "grandma's boy" is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness. it won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half.~steven cvisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com

there's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, don't take it seriously. chillax dude!!! well that's one point of view. the other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these "comedies".what you get is a slacker who, through some totally unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always a he), overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you won't believe it maaann. this guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. then he shines his shoes with it". hilarious.most of the usual names turn up. david spade and rob schneider do unfunny shtick but they're crrrazzeee characters - a russian and, i'm holding my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. adam sandler, the king of the brainless unfunny, illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called dante shows up, yet again. the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy dante is famous for cos we are clueless. allen covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. he was 42 and looked years older.did i laugh? yes, but no more than i would at a tv sit-com and i don't have to pay a penny to watch them. please stop making these movies.

positively ridiculous film.if doris roberts, shirley jones and shirley knight persist in these kinds of films, they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full-time.while the idea that a 35 year old swinger, who works on video games, loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight, this is foolishly dealt with. imagine the 3 bags getting high on stuff that grandson alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson!the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film. the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others.terrible best describes this miserable film.

what could be expected from any adam sandler-produced comedy, grandma's boy is predictable and so dumb it is sickening. allen covert stars as alex in the film, a 35 year old pothead who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandma and her two roommates after losing his apartment. some usual plot turns occur: he has trouble adjusting to his new living situation, which in turn makes him have trouble at work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the office's new consultants. throw a weird boss, almost alien company star, really nerdy best friend, a few scenes at burnt-out pot dealer's place, a really big party scene, and an original video game alex is trying to finish by himself into the mix you have grandma's boy in its entirety. allen covert does make a marginally good lead, linda cardellini is cute enough for her role as the just-one-of-the-nerds office consultant samantha, and a few scenes do manage to squirt out a chuckle or two but none of that makes grandma's boy worth much of anyone's time. most of the supposed funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them are nothing but "humor" that would make anyone at national lampoons embarrassed to watch, joel moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video game mastermind j.p., and the entire film actually manages to be boring on top of not funny or substantial. well, at least grandma's boy did something for someone: adam sandler was able to get a few paychecks to his out-of-work friends david spade, kevin nealon, and rob schneider.

honestly, this may be the worst movie i've ever seen. and i've seen spider baby, and not of this earth. heck i've even seen 200 motels. having just discovered the freaks and geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda cardellini i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try. that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb. i didn't realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio. this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state. seriously. watch this movie if you think will farrel is really really really funny, if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius. watch this movie but please don't breed!

creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. it either works, or it does not. grandma's boy is one of those movies that does not work. it may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films (sans sandler himself, he's just a producer).alex (allen covert) is a game tester. he's 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid-filled workplace. he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just been spending the rent money on philipino hookers and not paying the landlord). desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, lilly (doris roberts of everybody loves raymond) and her two roommates.that's the basic plot of the film, thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha (linda cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as velma in scooby doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can, a robot-like game creating prodigy j.p. (joel moore) who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix, and of course, all sorts of sex and drug related jokes. that's it.the problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it just is not funny. it is totally mind-numbingly boring, and only sparingly funny. nothing really happens at all. no emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense swearing. you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, wishing you had not even bothered with the film. how this film was greenlit and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me.there's just no entertainment value to come from it. none of the actors are actually putting in good performances, they are just acting like idiots for the camera, and hoping for the best. stoner comedy has been done before multiple times, and on occasion, actually works (harold and kumar go to white castle and dazed and confused come to mind). here, it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already. the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either.other than a few funny one-liners, this movie should just be out-right missed altogether. it's not very funny, the entire plot is silly, it's boring, and it just makes for one horrendous film. avoid it like the plague.1.5/10.

this movie is on the level with "welcome home roxy carmichael" for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. if these guys weren't adam sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. i hate this movie, it makes me want to injure people. i will admit that i have high standards, but honestly i'd rather watch step up 2. the ultra sad part was when i logged onto imdb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. this is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. after seeing this rating, i would like to suggest "tyler perry's house of pain" to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination.

it's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film. the story is predictable when not completely laughable. it's all a matter of "dutiful gestures" which, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. yes, the mgm "production values" are gorgeous, and yes, ms. lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective... it's my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released; the passage of time has not improved it.

i fully agree with the previous reviewer. there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. hedy lamarr isn't at her best, and spencer tracy appears to be naive, simple and overly-hopeful -- both in love and life; an idealist role that played out best in 'boys town'. if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station...whoa...it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast. not the best acting on anybody's part. miscast and mismatched. story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent. hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself, which is truly the best part of the film. spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason.

hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress, is again the kept mistress of kent taylor, society playboy and general all around rat. on a boat from the yucatan after taylor's given her the brush she tries suicide. but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean.tracy's quite the all around medical fellow. i guess he never heard the word specialist. he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research. lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern. of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens.watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracy's oscar winning boys town. unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker ain't a patch on what he did as father flanagan. maybe they were trying to give father flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak.tracy and lamarr did not get along too well. in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film, presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did. she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions. and a whole new supporting cast was brought in.fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them.

i adore hedy lamarr. i think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s. she was the nastassja kinski of that era, and critics didn't take her seriously. having said all that...this film is a bore. when i watched it for the first time, i was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in story, but in makeup and costumes. hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. so does hair length and style. reason: this thing had so many writers and underwent so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all. her "lady of the tropics" began filming after this one began, yet it was released before "i take this woman." in fact, at the time, it was known in hollywood as "i re-take this woman." that should tell you something. i'm a spencer tracy fan as well, but he is awful here. i've read in various film histories that he absolutely despised hedy lamarr, and that looks perfectly obvious on film. no chemisty whatsoever. the story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely. i can't recommend this one at all.

i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are exchanged among various rental outlets. 'the man who skied down everest'. hmm... never heard about it. the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to ski down everest and actually did it. sounds interesting. i rented it. as expected it was documentary style. the first part can be summarized so: "i always wanted to ski down mount everest". this is followed by some footage of preparation for the event. lots of preparation footage. ok, i suppose it takes a lot of preparation. then we are treated to a protracted piece on the skier, yuichiro miura's philosophy on life etc. more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the skiing fits in to this show. more preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain. more philosophy is shown. at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin' thing. lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow miuras' speed on the steep slope. finally he straps on the skis and gets ready to go.he's off... he skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot out from under him, he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and that's that. end of story. what the heck was that?ok i can buy that he always wanted to ski down everest, made extensive preparations and actually tried it with camera crew in tow. it didn't work and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself, so what egregious hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it skiing down everest? perhaps the title,"the man who's feet shot out from under him and he slid on his ass down everest" was just too long for the tape box.

i saw this film when it came out. let me see now--this guy who had earlier skied down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act---to ski down the world's highest peak. well--and here comes the spoiler--what happens, see, after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top--and a life is lost in the bargain--he gets on his skis, manages to make it down a very very short way, at which point his parachute opens...and that's that. and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got. another spoiler--oh yes, one of the sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse. the narrator, who is quoting the "daredevil skier, casually remarks that, according to the sherpa religion, since this man's body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest. is it worth it, the narrator muses. yes he answers--because it served the purpose of letting this clown "ski down everest." i can't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid. this is one to miss at all costs.

if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of mount everest, then you may enjoy this movie. just skip ahead to the views of the mountain.(spoiler alert) however, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 sherpas and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down mount everest.the question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives, and he answers an emphatic "yes".the part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. he skis for a short time, then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow.

i'm a huge lover of really bad b movies. and i especially love alien/scifi movies. i say the cheaper, cheesier, and campier the better. a low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad b movies, but this movie is so bad that i really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad-lib actors. first off, there's no real plot, it's all sort of situation "comedy" (if it can be called that). the "comedy" in this movie is more about characters saying, in essence, "look at me, i'm in this crazy situation! isn't this funny?", but it's only pathetic because nothing anyone's doing is that funny. there's no comedic acting skill, nor any kooky plot to carry all the very un-imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd.the bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad ad-lib acting, actors saying really stupid things over and over again (perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases, perhaps just b/c everyone in this is so bad), really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks, and people barfing and passing out in bathrooms.there was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who i could tell had some acting chops and was kinda' convincing in his role. he was as out of place as a solid bm in a weekend detox unit's bathroom. corey feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (thankfully we didn't have to put up with him any longer), and he was filmed off site -- probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere. he said a few really un-funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance.if you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) you'll lose by watching this garbage, avoid it. if you do a lot of drugs, like adam sandler's comedy stylings (and thus have no standards whatsoever), and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie. p.s. i think the people who raved about this must work for troma or something, b/c i can't believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie. (do drugs really ruin your judgment that much?)

this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - which prove why actors - even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not!i'll say this though - the better moments show some basis for being really funny (not just wacky), to keep trying, maybe taking some classes, and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie. ("dude, where's my car" and the "scary movie" sequence have it all over this ... college attempt.)the lighting wasn't; the production wasn't; and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice try unconvincingly executed). (this reminded me of "dark star" - which is about being "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.)the talent was the bartender (he said 'dog' so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting... wasn't he? ... now that's acting!), the mark hammond guy, and marty. i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them... 3/10.-ld______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this show makes absolutely no sense. every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police? you know, the people who can actually do something about it... but every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. all the evidence has been sabotaged. and you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? yay! we've solved the murder! now like every other week, let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.

thank god this has not been renewed by itv.this series, while popular (god knows why) has a very simple - 'look i've found another body behind the flowers/bushes/trees/wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time this series' plot. the dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children - talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point.they just 'happen' to be around when someone does something out the ordinary - and no-one notices them.every time they look into and investigate someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else - messing up the lives of all - including those completely innocent.they break and enter into people's homes, stealing items and evidence (even firearms) being nosey and getting into people's lives, spying on them and going through their stuff. they never apologise, never get caught or arrested (and if they do they can talk their way out of it, even though another character who does the same gets put in prison!!!).they always come up trumps. now i know that this is an easy going series, but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes! put simply, it's unrealistic.i think that they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where they are every other week), so i do hope it never comes back.itv should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - 'someone's been murdered at the village fair - again' type series.

i saw this film at our crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavored to portray. how did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? which of the two were f***ing the girl under the tree? it was unclear. and, there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, "this must be how they sound, just soften the "r"" approach to dialogue, so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether. aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during "emotional" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. walt goggins' character was supposed to have been from morgan city, louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. the other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. before i start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia, i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably "punks" "when love comes" and "b monkey". but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. well, tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. so, i wonder, if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in minnesota and in mississippi, why can't anyone else? what a waste of my time.

the hebrew hammer is a clever idea wasted, as the execution is weak. as if often the case with iconoclastic humor, it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs, which simply isn't enough. poor-taste humor has two elements -- poor taste and humor -- and both are needed here, but the humor is pretty scarce. as a result, it is often painful to watch, all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers, particularly adam goldberg as the hh himself. the shaft references are funny, though, but only to those who know those movies, and they certainly don't carry the hebrew hammer.another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of american jewish culture, and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes.

i was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best, the only funny character is, believe it or not andy dick. the timing was just horrible on most of the jokes & gags and the writing was bad, i mean i know its supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just did work. besides this whole genre has been beaten to death already, with all the austin powers movies & undercover brother, it just seems old, it also just feels like a rip off from undercover brother (which also wasn't hysterical, but a lot funnier than this). also, for an comedy/action movie the direction was kind of bland. i don't know if this is going to be released in theaters, but it definatley is made for tv.

not like i went in expecting a lot out of it, but i was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie. this isn't even that. this item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies i've ever seen (and believe me, i've seen a lot of them). bad acting, zero characterization, little to no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that that's there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in). sure, it has action and is loud, and has more action, and more noise, and blood, and action... these things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie. beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made--all i can assume is they haven't seen many. i suggest seeing near dark instead.

i mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the buffalo - niagara falls area might be something different. unfortunately i was incorrect. there are are many problems with "the falls", that really have nothing to do with it's low budget video production. immediately one has to question why all the constant narration? my feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow along, without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling. the acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. finally, the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video, which i found to be totally unacceptable. the narration, bad acting, and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided. - merk

i'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap.who knows: "witchery" may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios, even with a "big name cast" (like blair and hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef (i dunno, some woman...).but on film, it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard, and one of them (a woman, i'd guess) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque, tortuous ways. okay, right there you have a cross-section of plots from "the exorcist", "the omen", "ten little indians" and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line. none of it is very entertaining and for the most part, you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over.no, not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much. they're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their "all". from the looks of it, hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson (and who can blame him?) and linda... well, who knows; a celebrity peta benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays.and the torture scenes! ecchhhh. you'll see people get their mouths sewn shut, dangled up inside roaring fireplaces, strung up in trees during a violent storm, vessels bursting out of their necks, etc, etc. sheesh, and i thought "mark of the devil" was the most sadistic movie i'd seen....don't bother. it's not worth your time. i can't believe i told you as much as i did. if you do watch it, just see if you can count the cliches. and yes, blair gets possessed, as if you didn't see that coming down main street followed by a marching band.no stars. "witchery" - these witches will give you itches.

i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible. there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less. the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing/racing. the car chase isn't so bad (though not as exciting as fighting) but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring. basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan. even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour.i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions. i usually try to see the subtitled version...i wish i could understand chinese.i've only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didn't turn out so well.avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports.

second nature will not go down as one of the worst tv movies of 2003, but perhaps the worst of all time. formulaic, derivative, and every performance phoned in, from far, far away. everyone associated with this project should have a hard time looking in the mirror.

it's a shame that quality actors like baldwin and booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money. but, hey, it's a cruel world...this is just another one of a long line of assassin thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it appear more appealing than it is. sure, it has some nice locations, it's a slick production, there is some good camera work and editing, and it's fairly well paced, overall.so, what's the real problem? quite simply, the whole premise is just totally unbelievable. however, instead of spoiling a rotten story for you, i'll let you find out what it's all about, that is, if you can get through it. i managed, but only because i like baldwin and i kept hoping that it would get better.it didn't. and, it had one of the most anti-climactic endings that i've seen for a long time. in fact, maybe never...but, it's harmless fun, i guess, if you've got nothing better to do.

i and a friend rented this movie. we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging. the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending. we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.

i'm sorry guys, all who thought this film could be something great, i'm afraid you would be disappointed.the standard, the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot. so simple, that the movie is not evolving until the end. i asked myself if the plot wasn't about the action but about the main character (played by mickey rourke), but i found that the character was inconsistent - either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother. but both don't go together, because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. now, joseph gordon-levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. i didn't believe his acting, it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn't provide. and he didn't have to, because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough. the only one whose acting was great, was diane lane. if not her, i would give this movie 1 star.in conclusion, i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot. and i completely blew it with my high expectations.

based on the elmore leonard novel of the same name, killshot suffers from a lack of focus, direction, and creativity  all elements which the original story likely had, and negative test screenings forced severe edits, (including the complete excising of a character) resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a leonard story. far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical trait of the author's work) and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who don't command our sympathy. while the story itself provides precious few twists and turns, sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery. washed-up hit-man armand "the blackbird" degas (mickey rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment. now on the run from his former employer, he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal richie nix (joseph gordon-levitt) to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor. when struggling couple carmen and wayne colson (diane lane and thomas jane) are privy to the thieves' blundered plot, they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses. killshot proves that being based on an elmore leonard novel isn't grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. the characters, situations, and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more. it's not that there wasn't potential, especially when rourke's black-garbed, calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene  purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away. the style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing; visually the roles of bird and even wayne are fleshed out befittingly, giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impasse.the pairing of the cold and calculating black bird with the irrational and explosive richie is an enticing combination (comparisons to fargo would be extravagantly too kind), except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting. as richie starts picking up the more experienced killer's habits, bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder. regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with donna (rosario dawson), it's hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome. likely or not, this is killshot's unfortunate downfall  and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing. - the massie twins

humm, an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair, i wasn´t expecting very much, to be honest and in fact, i took even less than i was expecting. it doesn´t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this. apart from that you are going to love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. now i only want to watch "troll 3" by this same director, sure it is not going to be worse than that.

it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise. didn't they do that with truman capote the same year, and the zodiac killer last year? interesting.writer/director david michael latt didn't have steven spielberg's budget and c. thomas howell is not tom cruise. this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $588 million worldwide.the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles, who played a pastor that was giving up on his god.gary busey was creepy as an army lt.

why does c thomas howell do these movies? cruise (howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effort.where do i start here? production values - i'll start with the good stuff. the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. the set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.script - terrible. a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. the amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. very poor storyline (but so was the cruise wotw) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.special fx - okay, i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, washington, liner. but in the main the "alien" machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.acting - i'm a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie. there is no comparison. he overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. hysterical. but after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green (zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. i honestly could not understand one word he said - i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the dvd did not have subtitles. this seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. none of them are good.direction - not bad but not good either.score - dismal.overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won't have a career soon enough.3/10.

one of my favorite "bum" actors, c. tom howell, stars in this tepid remake of wotw. he runs around a lot, while a cgi-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. the budget for this one obviously was pretty low. it also was one of the asylum productions. have you seen any of those? yikes! i am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. and if truth be told, neither version is all that hot. the george pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the h.g. wells novel, primitive special effects and all. perhaps because gene barry was much more convincing in the lead than howell or tom cruise.

it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good; hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. very good. actually, it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a bravura performance.the acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. the fault was, in part let us be fair, that the plot bore as much resemblance to the hg wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor. but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the colander "my, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes", unless, that is, holes are your bag; in which case this film will commend itself to you.the fault in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, dvd actors who knew full well, one assumes, that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the $5 dvd shelf. and overpriced at that.so should you watch it? why yes, of course, you should. you are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.

my paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the dvd box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying.this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember. my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version. the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.but as the film wore on, we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing, trite writing, and crude special effects. we gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly, it couldn't possibly get better.since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics, here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments, even if they amount to spoilers:- the lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother, the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. the son asks, quietly worried, "will i ever see you again?" perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition, but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation.- a huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. a crowd of people stands nearby, peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. one woman finally says "it's gi-normous!"- after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a bystander, now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, have an exchange something like this, in a quietly puzzled tone:"what was that thing, anyway?" "i dunno..."- a crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it, the crowd starts to run away, seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger, let alone unusual circumstances.and so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. but please, please, save yourself the bother, even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! the film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus, say, king vidor's "solomon & sheeba" starring yul brynner wearing a wig). life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. there must be something more productive and enjoyable to do, like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage.

this movie is so bad they should burn the master. you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one. the graphics are less than fake, they're horrendous. then you've got the rambling through the countryside star gazer work-a-holic who bounces between his own lunacy & the mad rantings of the crazed preacher. & when he finally makes it to dc, they don't even have the decency to kill him; the monster (which you don't know at the time) is already dieing but how ... who knows & of course it has the ultimate sappy ending... everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family & a handful of stragglers survive. imagine that! this will be the movie that c thomas howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in. it probably gives him nightmares.

after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters, i was hooked on the topic. i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie, people getting vaporized, people panicking, fire, explosions, it was all so great...so a few weeks later i enter my video store, and i see david michael latt's version of war of the worlds on the shelf. "it couldn't have come onto dvd, that fast, could it?" i said to myself. i read the back of the case and saw c. thomas howell, instead. "oh, i remember him from the outsiders!" so i thought, it might have been a try.i was wrong, dead wrong. as soon as i watched the opening credits, watched them take forever, i knew something was wrong. something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did. the whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. from the acting, the special effects (stupid looking tripod things, when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version, in fact, the plot was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! what the crap? i ended up being so bored, that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting. and nothing was really.my advice: don't even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month, buy that one! but please, please, i beg of you! stay away from this turd before it smothers us all!

this movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. it made no sense! it was well acted, but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. the alien machines were created with pentium i technology and no creativity, they were crabs! the under-lit and barely seen aliens were frisbees with legs. where were the tripods? the editing, done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper latt, jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated numerous times. most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane katrina. the next time latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! that doesn't include the writing, editing, directing or visual effects credits on other movies. if the rest are like this snot-load, then he's just making fun of us. this was a slapped together rip-off of spielberg's movie, nothing more. i'm looking forward to latt's "backbroke ridge', "x-man iiv", "the hillocks have eyes."

i wish i could have given this a zero. sure i'll admit that i also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the spielberg version. a clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and being prominently displayed at the video store. however, i was willing to give it a go anyhow - i wish i wouldn't have.where do i start? i have read some of the other reviews here and have to say i disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good - sorry even c. thomas howell stunk. none of the performances were any good. not a one.even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible! "ginormus" and "dick skinners" just doesn't really cut it.now as for the story well - it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old. the main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient - or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together. for example he is trying to get to a place called new hope to find his brother. during a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to new hope. what the hell is that? when he gets to new hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother. then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in. he was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was? he has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. there are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse yet dusk of the next day. i also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason - we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house. which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice. what the hell, the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? there is one point where an alien kills a random citizen, supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him - but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face. the special effects in general are terrible. the entire movie is like a bad "train wreck". when we finally get to the end, after this guy trying to get to dc to find his family, they just appear. no searching no asking questions nothing. just oh there you are i am so happy - the end.i am sorry if my review rambles a bit but this movie was so bad i had a hard organizing my contempt. please save yourself the time and don't watch this sneakily displayed pile of cinematic stench. it is quite possibly the worst film i have ever witnessed. i would rather have been getting a root canal - it would have been less painful.

i am not a big fan of the spielberg/cruise version of this film. and so i must throw in with the more humble latt/howel version. c thomas howel had more heart and more sympathy that cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars. there would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no cruise. because i doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the david michael latt version. so, comparing apples to turnips i guess i have to go with the turnips. at least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market.

h.g. wells' war of the worlds by director david michael latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $1 million. for this budget, the production value wasn't too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget) and sound design. the less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best (but again i think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (again it's because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. however, again, i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. still you should,d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.

while it has been many decades since i last read mr. wells "war of the worlds", or "the time machine", or any other of his works, i believe that they were all set in london, or at least, in england. this grade "b" ("c"?) movie is set in the eastern part of the united states as was orson welles excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. however, this film exhibits none of the quality of the narrative style of the mercury playhouse program. thomas howell's emoting would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. i was actually embarrassed for him. his rolling around in the grass on the hill crying "my family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to the death of his brother. of the three film versions of the story that i have seen, this was by far the worst, with gene barry's 1950's version the best. additionaally, this was the first time i ever saw a "machine monster" dripping sticky saliva such as did the creature in the "alien".

i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie. i think the director filmed it in his back yard! there was no real plot. terrible script.terrible acting.the worst production i have ever witnessed. a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard.i don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one.life is to short to waste your time with this movie!

spoilers****this is tenchi?this is not tenchi.practically everyone is written horribly out of character ... when it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between ayeka and ryoko.also, the villainess is not punished for her actions, which amount to mind-control rape. if a male villain had done to one of the women what haruna does to tenchi, then he would have (rightfully so) painfully bought it at the end of the movie, dying horribly, and the audience would have cheered. but not only does haruna pay no price for her crimes, ryoko actually forgives and understands her actions. no! the real ryoko would have disintegrated her for what haruna had done to her beloved tenchi; the audience i saw this with, myself included, all booed audibly at this sceneanime fans, avoid this movie. tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.

"tenchi muyo in love 2" is the third tenchi movie. it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one. at the risk of giving out spoilers, tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back. nothing new there. a past love of yosho's is the bad guy. that was done in the second movie. the battle between aeka and ryoko and is starting to get boring. the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy. i personally don't know what aic, it's makers, were thinking. i gave this movie a vote of 4.

there were but two reasons for me to see this film. first of all stellan skarsgard and marisa tomei were in it (who are both good actors) and i had nothing better to do. while seeing the film though, i immediately thought of something better to do: sleep! this film is a complete waste of time. it is a standard ex-cop flick. the ex-copper is the best there ever was, but he was fired. he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day. all big surprises (not!!!). go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one.4 out of 10

the perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie:1. take one burnt-out, rogue ex-cop with a bad attitude, yet a sensitive touch as well (closet concert pianist with a pet cat);2. add some "cool" retro gadgets like a beat-up porsche 356, a roaring bike, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles;3. mix in a couple of "free-spirit" locations e.g. a trendy sea-side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office;4. spice it up with "deep" socio-romantic themes such as a post-divorce-traumatized-but-finally-remarrying-ex-wife, a secretly-admiring-and-therefore-forgiving-waitress, a pair-of-former-colleague-cops-only-one-of-whom-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-buddy-getting-iced-over-a-suitcase-full-of-illegal-$$$;5. let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a "fast-paced" though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes, cheap tender moments and sluggish wise-cracks;6. serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do!).

wow...reading through these comments, i see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the us and ... the dutch! the us p.o.v. appears to be that this is quite a good little movie, parker being a likable hero, the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality.all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems. they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster.far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically. still, based on factual observation - i saw the movie with my very own eyes - i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark: "parker kane" is poorly made, utterly boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation.

poor old robert taylor. other than the feds, nothing much has gone his way - this almost-shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more. it's one of those cheesy detective-crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through - usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously! a pity; australian films, particularly in the 2000-01 periods, have been of exceptional quality overall - but i suppose there have got to be a few misses. why even make a film like this, that obviously isn't going to be any good?

the funniest thing about fortunes is that one of the main characters, lewis (urbaniak) has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film. this is sad, as well, as i guess by large, this is supposed to be a comedy, or dramedy, but that's the funniest thing i can remember from watching this.three friends go out and drink one night. on the way home, two decide to get their fortunes told by a "gypsy," as they call her. those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. then, nothing happens.i hope i didn't spoil the movie there, but really, this extremely low-budget, bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell. yeah, i'm being harsh. honestly, it wasn't that bad, it was just blah.the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch, though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines. the clichéd "ladies man," the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. the only bright spot, was the remaining friend, the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. he was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. unfortunately, that's not saying much.perhaps i'm being too cruel. heck, they got the ambition to make a movie, went and got funding and accomplished something. unfortunately, however, i can't at all recommend the film on the basis, there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions. this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes.

this is just a very bad film. miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden. it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all. one of the worst films that i have ever seen!

terence stamp can carry off anything, but this is still a shallow one-dimensional movie. it's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you're into drag queens, i guess you might like it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. it's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and cuddly. it gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue, which is amusing in this sanitized form, i guess. ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations. the dramatic content is a token appendage - they hardly try to get you to take it seriously.

this film tries hard but fails. perhaps to non-australian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue, but to the native it is merely tedious.anyone who lives here knows broken hill is a rough, tough isolated mining town. if a couple of citified fruits turn up in drag, well it's all so predictable. where have i come across that well-worn theme before? oh yes -- town mouse and country mouse. spare us.i kept hoping it would improve but after the broken hill scene i could see where this was heading and so turned off the tv and went to bed.

we brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. the film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.just terrible

the costumes are outrageous and the australian outback scenery is fun to view, but there is an edge to this story - a mean edge - about drag queens. i particularly noticed that in terrence stamp's character, "ralph bernadette bassenger." perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing "good-guy- like" about ralph-bernadette and his group of "queens." once again, we get the strong liberal slant which says anything goes and if you're not "with it" - or in this case, pro-homosexual, then you are a homophobe. (gasp!)what's really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his "alternative-lifestyle" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script. pitiful.

this is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more. but like so many others, it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours.the pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the outback from sydney to alice springs. they run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.the real trouble is with the dialogue. the leads are fine (though pearce's continual campness becomes tiresome), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away. characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags.writer/director elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make-up. for a movie about self-confidence and just being yourself, it all seems very insecure with itself.

"priscilla, queen of the desert" is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of australian cinema. i found it quite disappointing. the lead actors are great - terence stamp is aging beautifully, guy pearce should do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses and i've been a fan of hugo weaving since i saw him play oberon eons ago. the cinematography is great, but if you've ever been to the australian outback, you'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a box brownie and it still would have looked spectacular.so what's my problem? well, three things. first, there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film. a woman who has to earn her living shooting ping pong balls out of her privates in a roadside pub deserves our sympathy. tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment.second, the scene when they sing "i will survive" to a group of aboriginals is offensive. to try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trannies and the almost total destruction of aboriginal culture, which is what i assume the scene is supposed to do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of paris hilton.last of all, and the greatest defect of the film is that it just isn't funny enough. did stephan elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film? anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have rapier-like wits and they're not afraid to use them. now, i can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused classification but elliott should have been able to gather enough "fit for the kiddies" material to complete his film.so, all in all, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.

shaggy, friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, being imaginative isn't enough, you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us. drag queen comedy-drama from australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the outback in their pink bus, christened priscilla. while not a formula film per se, there are the obligatory "road movie" sequences (bonding by the bonfire, facing down the rednecks, etc.). writer-director stephan elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative, a dire subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son (both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy whatsoever. it has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast, but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way. ** from ***

i like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. terrance stamp, guy pearce & hugo weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around, but i could not get into this. i don't know if it's because i don't understand the lifestyle or what, but i could not get my head around this film. worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens i've ever seen. i think that was part of the point, i don't know. i realize that is probably an insult, but i don't know what else to call them. i must say i bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. i will say that i can't usually appreciate costume designers very well, although i notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but i was very much impressed with these. very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but i don't think they're supposed to be. i don't know i am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers, but i wouldn't go see ballet, or opera either so i don't know. if this is your kind of film then you will probably like it, but if it's not skip it because it is...well not for most of us. i just checked it won the oscar for costume design & i will say rightfully so. i must say ebert didn't care much for this film either, though he liked it better than i did.

a romp across a disbelieving outback, this outragous adventure enchants through it's downright brazeness. comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as drama from crisis. perhaps a little too queenie for some - i would love to have watched in a cinema audience in the outback. shockingly good

great balls of fire is the movie you show to someone you really, really hate. it is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents. i've enjoyed some of dennis quaid's performances in the past, but he goes totally over the top in this film. he doesn't so much cross the line, he pole vaults over it, then comes back to jump over and over again. he struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. it's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. was he desperate to win a golden raspberry or some other award for bad acting? that's the only conclusion i can come up with. thank you dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. where was the director to reign in this guy?the opposite end of the extreme is winona ryder, she of the plastic features and plastic acting. i came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. that was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth, all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of jerry's underage cousin/wife. this brings up the film's mixed up message, that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. i fail to see what is so "okay" about that, but it looks as though hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. talk about "family values."another problem is the format. is it a stright forward re telling of lewis' life, or is it a musical? i'm not talking about the music, i'm talking about the truly weird scene where jerry drives up to the school, starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was broadway musical in search of a tony. fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. but who really cares? i don't. and neither should you. you can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film. so don't waste your time, it's too precious for something this misguided and poor.

dennis quaid is tryin' hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy. and he's doing too much to prove it. tv sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white footages. music is fine too, because mr. lewis himself is singing. but the rest is just hollywood b-movie style, with the fifties happy days complex. i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder.

i must say i was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey (in desperate need of a feather transplant)! i'm giving it a 1 because i think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - jerry lee lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put out such trash and the "killer" does not deserve this! it's a good thing it came late in his career... they said elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for jerry lee, had it come out some 15-20 years earlier! it's based on myra gail lewis book and that's a shame to begin with. it's a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with lewis and there is far better books about the killer, that could have made a much better and more interesting script. add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! the otherwise fine actor dennis quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! he is walking around in the picture, talking about his "god-given talent" and as a spectator, you wish he'd show some of it on the screen too! silly gestures and funny faces and jerry lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie! the rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for winona ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. it's "grease" all over again and whenever jerry lee take a ride around memphis in his convertible, having the radio on in the car, the whole town is dancing to the music from it! everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved... from the wild man himself to sun records sam philips! and it's a damn shame! a charismatic and interesting artist like jerry lee lewis deserves better and i hope he took the 500.000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f**k themselves... twice!

just re-saw this last night and to put it bluntly: "style instead of substance". we can already guess that there had to be a lot more to jerry lee lewis than what is depicted here. the jerry lee lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time, but then again, all the other characters are only one pencil-stroke from being total cartoon characters.let's take the beginning. we see jerry lee and his cousin, jimmy swaggart sneaking over to the black jazz club and we see jerry getting his inspiration. might be possible. we see how the two cousins choose different paths in life (also possible). then we cut to jerry lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by dennis quaid) and it's thrilling and a little scary. cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, myra. from then on the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events played out in a style befitting a news reel on high speed.not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made jerry lee. alec baldwin as jimmy swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greater successes in the years to come. winona ryder as myra is the most one noty character in the film. she teases, she sobs, she chews gum and play coquettish and that's about it. there is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third mrs. lewis and speaking of wives, where are the first two? that is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. we see jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. then comes the inevitable downfall. absolutely, no basis in reality.to conclude another minor quarrel: the movie takes place from '56 to '58 and still myra says: "i am only 13" right up till the end.

i haven't seen this film in years, but the awful "taste" of quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. some have commented on how quaid has jerry lee lewis "to a tee" but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage jerry in mind. nobody acts that way all the time, and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish, reducing lewis to a buffoonish caricature. the nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over-acting.the author of the book this is based on (nick tosches) is a good writer, who has written several fine musical bios (i particularly liked "dino" on dean martin); in the books tosches gives us a full human being, both separate from and involved in the "biz." quaid's acting seems to imply that jerry never acted like a human being. if people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them. as cartoons go, it is mildly amusing, but otherwise it is one of the most egregious, film-destroying performances i have had the "honor" of viewing. terrible...

it's really just terrible. quaid overacts more than shatner. the part where elvis walks in and says "you can have it all" just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that's bad enough as it is. drug use was completely snow coated, the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the bit about him wedding his cousin. quaid also looks nothing like lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. i wish this could be re-made in the future with someone who doesn't try so hard. a bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more about his actual life. i was very, very disappointed in quaid. don't watch this movie or you will be too.

this movie has some of the worst acting i've ever seen. dennis quaid's performance was high school caliber. while it's difficult to portray an off-the-wall character like jerry lee lewis, it can be done. just ask jamie foxx (although ray charles had more depth to his personality and musicianship than lewis ever dreamed of possessing). the phillips brothers portrayal belonged in the dukes of hazzard, and alec baldwin playing jimmy swaggart is a bit like donald duck performing shakespeare. when robert duvall played a country preacher, i bought it. baldwin never made me believe a single word. wynona ryder's part was the best, and she was mediocre. (and can anyone figure out how she was 13 when lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later?) some checking on the internet reveals the essential facts presented by the film were true, at least no more fouled-up than most hollywood bio pics. this film did badly at the box office, and it should have.

this movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that to actually insulting. i mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? from beginning to end we bombarded with quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions, laying on the "im a loose cannon" act a little thick. another picking point i had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. i mean in one scene where lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top, just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. then lewis begins to play his rendition of "a whole lot of shaking'" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world. these kind of scenes, of which there are numerous, coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter. so all in all this film is not worth viewing for anyone not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors decisions for an hour and a half.

spoilers abound. you have been warned.i was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first street fighter movie i have seen (i dare not go near the 1994 joke yet). very little grabs your attention in street fighter zero (alpha) as opposed to most japanimation. the fights are hilariously done over board (shun versus zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother.the main street fighter, ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! a shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind.what is with the artist 's drawing of feet? any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. the story 's soft nature makes the street fighter genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! a character study on more than just the core stars of the original street fighter is completely ignored. how many times did you catch rolento? adon? guy? street fighter zero lacks the imagination of the video game.

this movie is based on the series street fighter alpha (or zero)! it is placed in an other setting than streetfighter the animated movie! this movie is all about ryu who is accompanied by ken and chun li. i recognized rose,zanghief and birdie! there weren't any other characters used from the video game (that i could discover)! the fighting scenes were ok but nothing really spectacular! and there were not many of them! to me this is odd! isn't streetfighter about fighting! streetfighter the animated movie (1994) is far superior to this movie. it tries to be more than it really is! the use of the "hada power" and other supernatural elemnents have nothing to do with skills the characters have in the video game! and in this case that is a bad thing! the story is so boring that you don't really care what is happening! the action is toned down considerably! why? and what happened to the other characters from the video game! surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! the main attraction of the video game are the characters with their own special skills! in this movie it is all about ryu! that is why this anime fails!

being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film, street fighter ii: the animated movie, i was really looking forward to this one!however, it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose. most of the characters i could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superior.there are some good points however, the animation is superb!!!

not being a particular fan of westerns, i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an "i love lucy" or "lucy show" type of role. here she plays christine larson, owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in 1868 who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent (dean jagger.) ball's performance was ok - nothing really more than that; she didn't blow me away. it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what i'm accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout. (a typical funny line - "there's two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them!") i didn't find the story all that compelling, although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent. there's typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words. as to christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up; it's just a question of how she's going to get there. if you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in. if you're not big on the genre, this will be lacking. i'm not big on the genre. 3/10

i was 19 in 1970 when it came out and having heard how funny it was when it came out and reading the reviews here, i finally rented it and watched it. i didn't laugh once - a very unfunny flick - and i usually love reiner. i cannot for the life of me figure why this is seen as funny. i had not one chuckle. and i love comedies! oh well, at least now i know what all the shouting was about. not my idea of a comedy. go rent the navigator or the love nest by buster keaton - now those are comedy classics! if you rent this one - have a back-up rental so your whole evening isn't a loss. score 3 out of 10

a mild-mannered ny lawyer (george segal) is slowly going crazy. he promised his father on his death bed that he would never send their senile mother (ruth gordon) to a nursing home. years later he's taking care of a senile, dangerous psychopath. he meets a beautiful nurse (trish van devere) and they fall in love. but his mother keeps scaring her away. segal is ready to kill her....ummmm...this is a comedy? i have nothing against sick, black humor but come on...there has to be some limits! this movie goes out of its way to throw every tasteless sick joke it can think of and rub your face in it. too bad none of the jokes are funny. the jokes involve rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile old people, swearing and racism. basically this is a movie that thinks it's clever by trying to shock people and thinking they'll laugh at it. i was disgusted and didn't laugh once. the movie is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) dull. the cast is the only thing that kept me watching. segal and gordon were both wonderful in their roles--gordon especially. and van devere is pretty good also. but the script is against them. the only interesting thing (not funny) was a pointless courtroom scene with rob reiner jr. (and try to spot his then-wife penny marshall as a spectator).actually this movie could have been worse--the original ending had segal getting into bed with his mother and pretending he's poppa! that was (thankfully) changed.a real lousy, sick film. bottom of the barrel. i give it a 1.

in the opening sequence of "where's poppa?", george segal rises from his bed one morning, shaves, showers, puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mother's bedroom, we realize later, to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever. this is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture: insanity, blended with what might be taken as morbid daring.segal plays a new york attorney who lives with his supposedly senile mother (ruth gordon), whose life is further complicated when, while hiring a nurse to care for the old bag, meets the girl of his dreams, the pleasantly prim trish van devere, decked out like florence nightingale. his dilemma: how to integrate the lovely nurse into his and his pesky mother's life.segal's performance is about the only thing holding the picture together. his frustrations, his reactions, his comic timing is almost peerless (whatever happened to that guy?); where the film fails is in other areas. ruth gordon's characterization is dreadful as the mother. at the beginning, you can't figure out if her character is senile or just being deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out. by the end, it's clear she's just nuts. when segal brings van devere home to meet her, gordon's eyebrows furrow and she gets a mean, sinister look. she wants the intruder in her son's life removed; she's calculating. this is not the mode of a senile person. you're not getting a consistent performance throughout the picture, which is probably the director's (carl reiner) fault as much as gordon's. ruth gordon's old lady in "rosemary baby" is much more successful because with the kind of ingratiating, cloying person that ruth gordon generally plays, the audience responds to her as annoying. but when mia farrow is too timid to fight back, gordon becomes more cloying, her fangs dig deeper and deeper and we're frightened for farrow; this kind of imposition is genuinely terrifying. here, we're being asked to laugh at what we'd normally find annoying, and if gordon played it as helplessly nutty all the way, we might. but she's selfish and mean as well, and it dampens what little humor there is.there are a few good laughs, though. a courtroom scene with barnard hughes as a military officer and rob reiner as a counterculture punk is fairly hilarious, and vincent gardenia does a nice turn as a lombardiesque football coach. there's also an inspired bit where segal's brother (ron liebman), having been stripped naked by muggers on his way to segal's place, asks him for something for to wear home- and he gives him the gorilla suit.but of a lot of the script is poorly conceived and simply doesn't make sense. why is a new york lawyer with his own practice even living at home in the first place? why does segal, if his mother is senile, try to reason with her logically: "if you spoil this for me, i'll punch your f---ing heart out." why does liebman keep cutting through the park if he knows he's going to get mugged? why does he take a taxi after leaving segal's with gorilla suit? why wasn't he taking taxis all along? a funnier bit would have been liebman, as the gorilla, terrorizing the muggers. why does van devere keep coming back- after her first husband was a kook, why does she want to get involved with this bunch? i suppose if i put this to carl reiner, he'd say, 'these are crazy people, they don't have to make sense.' which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script that's full of holes. the characters' moment-to-moment behavior may not have to make sense, but their motivations do, and that's where "where's poppa?" falls apart; the situations are created just to have the gag, and the gags are mostly one-shots, they don't build to anything.carl reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco. how he has acquired this vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzles me; basically, his career has been to hold a microphone in front of sid caesar and mel brooks while they talk in funny voices. his son rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director. in show-biz terms, reiner pushes buttons; a monkey could do his job. and that is most apparent in his framing of the action. why is all of new york shot in tight and in close-ups, but the scenes in the country are all distant and panoramic? that's the mentality of carl reiner's direction, claustrophobic for the city, spatial for the country. in the final lunatic scene at the old folks home, the camera is so far off, you can't even make out what's going on. the abrupt ending suggests a resolution that segal could have easily arrived at ninety minutes ago; it also suggests reiner couldn't figure out how to end the picture. so he just cut it, as another example of "craziness". reiner seems to think dumbness equals craziness, and craziness without logic is always funny. it isn't, and the creators of "where's poppa" are as demented as ruth gordon putting pepsi in her fruit loops.

i was prepared to love "where's poppa", it features the nexus of normal lear sitcom character actors who, when i was growing up, felt like extended members of my raisenette-sized broken nuclear family. how fun it would be to see censor-free barnard hughes, vincent gardenia, ron liebman, rob reiner, and a pre-snl garret morris.but alas,"where's poppa" drags. it's claustrophobic and plodding, and breaks the cardinal rules of farce, lightness of mood and a fast pace.the plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (george segal) to rid himself of his overbearing jewish mother, who lives in his gigantic new york apartment. along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations: a comedic group of muggers who repeatedly mug the brother of the main character, the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love, ruth gorden pulling down segal's pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner. why doesn't this work? part of the explanation is the sense of doom engendered by the cramped, dark interiors and antique set-decoration. i absolutely eat up cinematography of new york during this era, but watching this movie felt like i was leafing through the police gazette in a dark bus terminal.the main reason though is the slow pace. modern mtv-style quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing tempo, but, even taking this into consideration, camera shots are held for an excessively long time. plot developments are also very slow. there is one situation in which this works: a weird love song george segal sings to trish van devere, softly, very close to her face, and for an excruciatingly long period of time. it reminded me of those cringeworthy extended shots in the british version of "the office", where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away, and at the same time you can't stop looking.sadly, most of the film is more "hurry up" than "can't look away". which made me wonder if it's possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. the dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to weigh down lightness of the farce. movies like robert altman's "m*a*s*h" and kubrick's "dr. strangelove" prove that it can be accomplished. they do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots, something "where's poppa" neglects.although the film features multiple, stereotypically-funny characters, almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the recalcitrant mother. the scenes featuring garret morris and the central park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break. the muggers seemed almost shakespearean, following the tradition of comic ne'er-d0-wells. if the rest of "where's poppa" had clung a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film. edgier isn't always better. it's as if all these talented actors and the director carl reiner, were taking a short before the creative maelstrom of the 70's .random notes: after strealing ron liebman's clothes, the muggers mention cornel wilde's "the naked prey" (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to 1968's "planet of the apes".as politically incorrect as he was, it's disquieting to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as charleton heston. linda harrison, who played "nova", taylor's mute mate, said that james fransicus, in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to heston.

new york attorney plots to rid himself of his senile mother after meeting an attractive, available woman. screenwriter robert klane, adapting his own novel (the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirty parts), doesn't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: to him, it's just an excuse for prurient comedy and scatological jokes. george segal--who, in the 1960s, starred mostly in war and espionage pictures--had become, by this time, one of america's greatest sad-sack comedians; his nutty reactions and batty responses rival only his mother's inscrutabilities. segal is paired well with trish van devere, and their moments of connection (though also played for laughs) are really the only sequences one can gravitate towards. ruth gordon, lovable as is she, is simply around too much--and more of her amounts to less. this is one of the worst directed and edited films i have ever seen from so-called professionals. promising scenes which ultimately don't play out for the full effect are haphazardly disconnected from other moments which flail around endlessly, causing the crass, rickety movie to self-destruct long before it's actually over. *1/2 from ****

george segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. there are many jokes about her alzheimer's-like dementia and most of them aren't funny, though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there (such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home). at first, segal tries to kill his mother because she's tough to live with and because he's a selfish guy. making the film sort of like a wiley coyote versus the roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot--too bad this was not the overall tone of the film.i do applaud carl reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone. i have a special place in my heart for films like ed and his dead mother, eating raoul and happiness of the katakuris--all films about death that dare to offend. the problem here, though, is that where's poppa? has some funny moments, but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland. plus topics such as homosexual rape, incest and the like are really difficult to make funny. i read in "the rough guide to cult movies" that it is considered a cult film, though i just can't see anyone wanting to see this more than once.

ok, where to start. i can't believe how many good reviews i read on here. i watched this (year 2004) and i had to fight to not push the stop button, i decided to continue just because of all the good reviews i read. after watching it i felt it was my duty to let the world know about this. first of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin, the plotline doesn't actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends, leaving the viewer wondering, `when is this going to start' so don't ever call this a `revenge movie' because the revenge doesn't even start until over half the movie is already gone by. furthermore, the movie tries to make you believe this is a post-apocalyptic australia. i am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign didn't quite convince me of that, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. so anyways, add this on top of randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have got yourself one crappy movie (i have nothing against gays, there was just no need for it). the only good part was the first chase scene, good directing considering it was 1979, and another good part is how he kills the last guy. so basically i recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle, which may lead you to gouge your own eyes out. don't say i didn't warn you.

this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff. well, then let me bash it to. compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays, this film isn't too bad. it has the beautiful leslie cumming. she is super hot, but can't talk very well. there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. she shows off her nice body. linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff. 3/10

i hired this movie out from my local movie shop, not really expecting anything to flash or fancy. since it was a "b" grade movie, made on a very tight budget. the opening scenes of the film were rather original and so was the plot and thats what made me hire the movie out. however the film becomes very boring and frustrating at points. the story had plenty of holes in it and the acting had its fair share of disappointments as well by the end of the film i was praying that a higher power was going to strike me down where i laid as i was extremely bored but more importantly frustrated with how the story turned out. i still don't understand what actually happened and i don't particularly care. in conclusion the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell (his domain ) was used as a basis for such a crappy film.

this remake is entitled "that darn cat", but d.c. the cat is more of a sideline than the major character. patti randall was not likable at all in this remake either. she reminded me of one of those high school goth jerks you read about who have been angry since the day they were born, so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day. the federal cop, kelso was okay, but not as good as the one in the original. i guess disney was trying to make christina ricci and doug doug (or whatever goofy name he has) into stars, but they don't hold a candle to hayley mills and dean jones in the original. i'm an animal lover and a cat lover and i don't blame d.c. for the remake being so much more inferior to the original movie. after all, they nearly cut him out of the whole movie. all in all, a very poor remake.

but i still enjoyed watching her, so i gave it a 3 instead of a 1. her expressions are priceless. some of the other cast members (e.g., michael mckean) are really slumming, too. the cat himself is somewhat amusing. aside from that, the movie is all cliche, culminating in a much-too-long car chase. (it's also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude, having been very "family" until then.)

the disney studios' remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever feline leading an f.b.i. agent to a kidnapped woman. christina ricci gives a churlish, let-me-outta-here performance as the cat's owner and the fed is played by doug e. doug, embarrassingly over-the-top, like a human cartoon. a pair of rich neurotics (dyan cannon and original "cat" cast member dean jones) are funny and the formula-plot still has a little juice left in it, but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious, and the cat is so lifeless, that it's strictly d.o.a. * from ****

chris ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this, but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain - much as i did when watching it. without her this would be no more than a cheap kids' movie, but at least she does add an air of quality. there are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business.there's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap disney re-make aimed at very undemanding children. i could watch ricci all day so i'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you too are a ricci fan, a cat-lover, or very small child, i doubt you will find this very entertaining.

i was 12 years old when i saw the original film (i lived in italy and the italian title was "fbi, operation cat!") that was a fun film and not just for kids. this awful remake it's pathetic even for a 5 year old! what possessed disney to ruin their reputation and the memory of a lovely film i don't know and i just can't believe it. even the title song in the original film (both original version and the dubbed italian version) was extremely nice and creating the mood for the story. on this remake the title song is even worst than the movie itself. it was just nice to see dean jones even if for just a cameo appearance, he was a regular on the great old disney's films. i cannot honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie.

i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience. you can either say to yourself a) "let's make a movie that kids today will love!" or b) "let's make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid!" the second approach explains why steven spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience. prime examples are e.t., the goonies or indiana jones. that darn cat is an example of the first approach. you see these flat, unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn't. the plot itself is enough for a ten minute short, but instead it goes on and on. and although i'm not a kid, i don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids? the clumsy cops chased by a dog, the old lady with a tweety bird or christina ricci's sarcastic oneliners? one actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humour: doug e. doug playing the fbi agent.

i watched this movie purely for the setting. it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of. the plot was predictable, the acting was mediorcre at best, the scares were all gross-outs, not true scares.i don't remember much of the plot, and i think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember. they didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential...the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. at low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and i'm using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings!

total garbage!!! no reflection to washington heights what so ever. if i had four arms, i'll give it four dumbs way down. acting performance worst than storyline. truly over rated. hour and a half of visual torture.rather watch ben aflec movies for the rest of my life. feel bad for the films that lost to this crap. what were the judges at the film festival watching? total garbage!!! no reflection to washington heights what so ever. if i had four arms, i'll give it four dumbs way down. acting performance worst than storyline. truly over rated. hour and a half of visual torture.rather watch ben aflec movies for the rest of my life. feel bad for the films that lost to this crap. what were the judges at the film festival watching?

starring tomas milian and manny perez  'washington heights' is a low budget drama set in a latino neighborhood in nyc.a young comic-book artist (manny perez) wants to escape his latino neighborhood. when his father is crippled by a robber's gunshot, the young man is forced to run the family bodega.the movie was shot in a budget (low resolution video and poor audio) with low profile actors.the plot flowed well for 85 minutes but the last 5 minutes were just terrible. we don't know for sure if perez and his girlfriend remained together and if angel ended-up in jail for the shooting.4/10

i walked out of this movie and i did this only one time before with the australian movie sweetie close to 20 years ago. after about three minutes i felt like killing the camera man and just couldn't believe that this film actually showed anywhere and- guess what - was nominated for two independent spirit awards. what???? regardsless how realistic the dialog might be (i will never use the word "dude" again!) -who wants to listen to these conversations? i don't go to the movies to be annoyed but that's all i got. the only good thing i came away with was the realization that if this movie can make it to sundance and other festivals, anybody can. well, wait, that might not be a good thing after all...

i saw this film at the 2005 edinburgh international film festival. this film had been compared in the eiff program to sideways - which i liked - so i was quite looking forward to this movie. i also liked garden state, napoleon dynamite etc... so i have had good recent experiences with slightly weird american indy films.unfortunately, i found that puffy chair does not compare favourably with any of these movies.i was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing, witty, insightful or even mildly interesting to happen. it didn't - and the shaky video cam was making me sick - so i left.this is only the second film i have ever walked out from (the first was "showgirls") which is slightly disappointing. i probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the wobbly picture - but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that i would be missing anything.disappointing.

this movie is ridiculous. it's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy. truly is bad cinematography. you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves. this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. it really is a very pointless movie.their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. unless you want to be bored out of your ass, i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.

plot:- a chair from ebay- random people- random people talk (" dude, it's right. " "i'm feeling it." "lets get married now!")- if you are a "hippie" then you will love this movie. (you must be high or drunk, otherwise you will question your life watching this junk.)this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end, and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews. if this wasn't aimed at my demographic, i don't know what it is aimed for. i found the plot everyday boring. it's something that i would do, and trust me it's not worth filming. going on a roadtrip and filming half of the silence does not make a movie!

imdb lists this movie as a comedy. i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isn't comedy. tragedy maybe.i won't say whether this is a good movie or not. all i know is it is not a comedy. i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of someones attachment to some ugly chair.this movie is not what is advertised. it's film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to "make people think". i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that i know, or even that i don't know. it's ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoever.it made me think alright. it made me think, "i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life back."i'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to them.i am not one of them.

so then... this is what passes as high art for the likes of sxsw film festival and sundance, eh? well, i suppose i can relate as long as story, script, dialog, acting (save for ms. aselton), cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant.i remember telling other film-making friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to wade through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the case of the duplass') could run out and make a movie. "the puffy chair." need i say more?this feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal, ever-expanding world of "dudeology" movies; young guns armed with a dvx100a, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written, shallow script, and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voilà!, instant feature video-makers. don't get me wrong -- i'm all about independent cinema (i.e. hollywierd sucks). but having said that, you can't argue with some of the realities of that system. if the duplass brothers would've had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers, its clear a script like this would never have been green-lighted! and therein lies the problem. there is no longer such a thing as a vetting process for getting films (sorry... videos) ready for production. just grab a dv/p2 camera and off you go! and what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. and why? precisely because its no-budget. i think its important, especially in todays climate of indie films, to quit allowing video-makers to high-jack the language by labeling themselves, "filmmakers." there is quite a difference in my book. when you have to go out and actually put your script on the line, asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature "film", knowing the potentially losses at stake, then you will know what it means to be a "filmmaker." but dropping a few hundred at sam's club for some dv tapes, some soda and chips doesn't cut it. oh... and by the way... i have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as "dude" throughout the entire movie. even mark borchardt reserves that intensely-overused moniker for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy mike is concerned!i think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy, no-budget videos for what they are, and simultaneously scold prestigious festivals for giving such casual efforts, high praise. either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups... "dude films."

in spite of many positive reviews this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialog you will ever hear. this is another road movie that really goes no where. the camera frequently goes out of focus and the constant panning in some of the over long scenes is annoying.the three characters are attractive but note likable. the cast also sets what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word "dude". (even howard stern has abandoned this tired pesudo pronoun).the three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise. they are clearly comfortable and bravely allow themselves to be depicted as shallow and even goofy. the character actors all seem as they are plucky amateurs who generously volunteered to speak a few lines.. indeed they all physically fit their roles well.all in all a dull 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity. this is among my ten worst films of all time.

i saw this at my city's independent cinema - no surprise, because no mainstream theatre would want its fingerprints on this train wreck.the camera work is very distracting. the constant shifting, refocusing, and zooms could induce a sensitive person to have motion sickness. it looks more like a film student's project than a serious movie.though well-acted, the characters are unlikeable. josh is devious, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. without any context to emily and josh's relationship, she comes off as a whiny, insecure girl who's desperate to get married. rhett is an emotional infant, incapable of understanding the complexities of human interaction. without any redeeming qualities, i didn't care about what happened to any of them.obviously some people liked this movie, as the couple sitting behind me were laughing hysterically. of course, they could have just making fun of it. i could hardly blame them for it.

i'd love to sit down and write an intelligent, well thought out review however, i feel i'd be spending more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did. i live in los angeles and i'm sorry to say that the characters seemed just so much like underemployed and overly ego inflated actors. there was not one moment in the film when i could escape the feeling i was watching the drivel ridden conversation of unemployed actors at a hipster la coffee shop. one of the worst "indie" films i've ever seem with so little to recommend it that hearing it won at sundance has effectively removed any prior interest i may have had in attending, much less considering a postitive sundance review to be meaningful. watch at your own risk.

"the puffy chair" was a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life which cannot be retrieved and spent in a more worthwhile way (even "the blair witch project" was a better use of life's precious moments). it must be called "the puffy chair" because only 'puffy' chairs could accommodate the extremely 'puffed-up', self-important brothers who drooled it out for public consumption; and, obviously, they are so full of themselves that they have assumed the public would actually want to consume their drool. "the puffy chair" made "the wooly boys" seem like a cinematic masterpiece! "valley of the dolls," "beyond valley of the dolls," "pink flamingos," "texas chainsaw massacre," "night of the living dead," "urban cowboy," "the blob," -- all of these would be a better use of one's time, than viewing "the puffy chair." the characters portrayed are either too predictable or too lacking in normal, emotional reflexes to even come close to being likable or believable. also, at one point in the film, while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town, if one watches closely, one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the southern united states, and the other half is located in maine. that's some town, eh?

most films are crappy with high production values, this one is crappy without high production values. which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies. as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn aselton who, i believe if given the proper script, could probably turn in a pretty good performance. she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh, who often refers to her as "dude" or "man" in a non-ironical tone.but heres the thing, emily is a semi-believable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast, to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh. when we first meet rhett we learn that he is "deep" because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world "uniquely!" rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emily's few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard, wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied.from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy, we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy! oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy! haha. this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be (and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit, i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome).i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award (oh south by southwest, why do you encourage them, its only cruel). but here is where i hand this film a compliment, it is the best of the mumblecore movement. mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting, but still, its good to be the best of something.i haven't seen baghead yet, but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward, the preview at least made it appear tolerable, where as even the puffy chair preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck. i've gotten off topic here, anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all, much like josh most likely isn't an actual actor but rather the director (or brother of director, there's some mixed messages there). i think rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why don't you play this guy named rhett in the movie, the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same, unless i am mistaken, which i am not.if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive. so anyways rhett, emily, and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and josh's dad. some stuff happens along the way, more bad acting, bad supporting actors, crappy camera work, an attempt at significance. this film wouldn't have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance.the whole thing is amateurish, if you can view this movie without paying for it, like if its on tv or for rent at the library, then consider looking at it, just to see if you like this super cheap style of film-making. i like what the duplass' are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept, but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see.

when the puffy chair beckons, beware of its soft, colorful upholstery.the movie starts out quite well. josh (mark duplass) and emily (kathryn aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. an argument occurs one night and in order to make up, josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his father's house where josh plans to deliver a purplish lazyboy recliner for his dad's birthday. emily accepts and along the way they pick up josh's flighty brother rhett (rhett wilkins), an amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than his own.the roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily, as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh "convinces" the original owner to refurbish it). rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of emily and josh's problems is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch one night ...and that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film.the big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair, when it isn't the chair at all that takes center-stage. it is josh and emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at josh's parents place on his father's birthday without a gift. josh never mentions the chair, nor does his father. there's no connection between it and the lives of these people. so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isn't there a tie-in with it at the end? bad script.the other annoying thing is that mark duplass' brother, jay duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable.the acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. all of the actors/actresses did fine jobs. but the poor production quality, stilted ending, and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems.

although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget, that's not what i go to movies for. there wasn't one character i found sympathetic, they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers. everything they attempt ends badly, it's all too hopeless for me. reviews refer to the puffy chair as a black comedy...comedy? the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother, he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck. nonetheless josh performs a "wedding" for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before. there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road. however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film...and i saw it at a free screening.

this low-budget indie film redefines the word "blah". it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the dictionary, defined as: "nonsense.. uninteresting, dull, lifeless". the movie redefines the word because i would have to add to those four words: "pc crap", "pretentious on a pathetic level", and "pointless".the film tries so hard to be "hip" and "in touch" with contemporary beautiful-people-struggling-for-je-ne-sais-quoi behaviour and "thinking" (do they think?). there is almost no plot to speak of, though there is one to sleep to. the phoniest and most politically-correct things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young, black stud, the black street-sax-player with a penchant for oh-so wise council and advice, and the fat black psychic. isn't it beautiful how the races can get along after all?... ahhhh... in the end, the woman reads out "poetry", which is nothing more than one of her dull "dear diary" entries. she gets a standing ovation(!!!), although in real life her listeners would have more likely than not dozed off into deep slumber. but this movie has little to do with real life, even though that is where it's supposed to be happening. in real life her "poetry" reading would have gotten standing ovations only if she had the sense to include the juicy, sexual details. "and then i rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty, impatient pink little vagina..." cheers! what's worse, the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or screws with someone, yet they never have the sense to show her breasts, which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess.the black guy and the blonde, who are separated by about a meter in height, hook up: they look like a cheap variation of rodman and madonna (as if the latter two aren't a cheap enough combination already). nicole eggert, mentioned by howard stern in his "miss america" book, is the blonde. stern writes of eggert that she took her implants out. yet i believe that when they took her implants out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake, for she looks starved here.the sax player in one scene develops angel-like wings; he looks like al roker advertising angel food cakes.

the only interesting part of this movie was it's jazz and reggae new orleans back drop. it tries to be one of those movies that has two struggles the heroine has to overcome, one from the past and one from the present which she fails to do convincingly. the acting's bad and the direction is even worse. i'm not surprised at all that this went straight to video. the end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced including the actors themselves.

this movie has a few good performances going for it -- and that's all it has going for it. the leads, especially pauley perrette, are appealing. (although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) the material -- that is the problem. i feel as though the screenwriter/director watched the entire run of felicity in one sitting, then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep. it really did remind me of felicity -- a thoughtful young woman finding herself, finding love, with a shake-them-up-and- see-what-happens approach to the characters and their relationships. except that while i usually enjoyed watching felicity, this movie left me cold. the writing is just awful. it's amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did, as the dialogue is dull at best. at its worst it becomes trite, stilted and amateurish. there is nothing original here, with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to begin with. (angels and fortune tellers? come on.) for the first half of the movie, i rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. by the second half, i just wished for it to end already. my sympathies to the cast, who deserved a better vehicle for their talents.

it was the first action movie made in banned in ussr hollywood action style. it is not even close to the hollywood action movies of that time. the plot is childish, the directing is so-so. this movie succeeded because it was first of its kind in russia. even though i watched it many times i have to admit it was kind of naive and i did not like it. this is not the best example of russian action movie. this is just the first experience.

officially the first martial arts movie in ussr cinematography featuring actual martial artists like tadeush kas'yanov and russian bruce lee - talgat nigmatullin. bad people highjack a ship in the high seas but fortunately just about everybody on board is a trained martial artist. a collectible for martial arts aficionado.

the only positive thing i can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now i finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie i ever saw was called.it would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable...a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even. why would anyone want to produce such waste? i refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented. making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point. anything else just doesn't make sense.

this movie is about people living at a trailerpark. later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out-of-work comedians, mainly old males. well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f***ing. but never there is any action, just those people talking. in the beginning i thought it's some cool perverted redneck-stuff, but after a while it got boring. i mean, how many versions can you think of saying f***ing, d**k & c**t? for sure, this can be funny - for half an hour maybe, not 80 minutes. but it was funny to watch those people trying to act. i'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing. but it does not disturb the movie, it's cool like this. because those individuals seem so poor, f***ed-up, crestfallen a***oles that the style totally fits. their wooden, helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere, i fell in love with the characters a little.***spoiler ahead*** later in the movie the f***ers do some comedy-shows (rhymes about f***ing) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction-advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs - armed with some weapons. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like action, but it's not. just some trashy home-camera takes. ***spoiler end***but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and i'm pretty sure it's just what the movie-maker wanted to have. it's the portrait of those f**k-ups in an groggy home-camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. but the texts about - you know what - the whole time get boring after a while.pretty young director who also seems an interesting person, as he played some teenager-stuff in popular movies/tv-series but now got in more horror-movies which is more his cup of tea i guess. and this, his first direction-effort will be distributed by troma now. don't know anything about a release, i got this one as an "advance screener" from this years cannes which says "for bootlegging purposes only".

another of those flimsy stories coupled with most forgettable musical numbers. powell and o'keefe as battling publicists are quite forgettable. however, there are two shining moments. hubert castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you will ever see - his "drunken walk" on the wire has to be the most spectacular piece of balancing ever recorded on film. he has to be seen to be believed. the other is sophie tucker doing a turn near the end of the film. her magnetism, her professionalism, her sheer talent at being herself - well, charisma is not learned - you have it or you don't. a great lesson for all would-be cabaret artists. a sad note: w.c. fields in his last film cameo is completely forgettable.

this piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again. the only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. i was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and i was free to vacate the auditorium. what an unmitigated bore; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. when i die, i pray i can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish.

sherman hemsley was great in the jeffersons and especially all in the family. he was also very good in amen, why on earth would he do this movie? this movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. luis avalos does the best he can but this is awful. this movie was the beginning of bankruptcy for sherman hemsley. i think he is very funny but this is an awful awful pointless ghost story. stick with ghostbusters.

this movie is só incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry, the cliché are put on thicker than 5-year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart, every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't have been funny if it were timed correctly.don't see this movie, there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again...ever.

i was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater. he never picked another one again! it was that bad! anyway, my friend then told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage. i thought she was kidding. it turns out, she was serious. she had never actually seen it, and she said that it put a quick halt to her father's writing career. i told her not to waste her time. but, if she did actually break down and watch it, she would see within the fist minute why this ended her father's days as a writer. i mean, even for the 1980's, this crap is bad beyond description. i mean, joe frazier as terrible tucker? and why in the world would two cops care one bit about a house full of ghosts? and the movie poster? a ghost with his tongue hanging out? what is that about? nothing about this makes any sense. well, i told my friend that this crap not only ended her father's writing career, it ended the careers of everybody involved. or, at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this garbage of a movie. let's just say that i will forever ridicule my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer for this movie! that alone should tell just how bad this is!

especially if you love horrible movies. when i first started watching it, all i could say was "i hope there's a dance sequence in it." imagine my delight when not only did the two main characters dance, but the main ghost began break dancing as well. and on top of that, sherman hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). it makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie, but i've never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better. not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he directed!).one note of warning, though, the writer seemed to really like jokes about the, um, male lower regions. for example, one of the characters discovers a book called "groins of the darker species." i am not kidding. and that, to me, is the most disturbing part of the film. other than that, find the most obscure video rental store in your town, get the movie, invite all your friends over, and laugh until you cry with ghost fever.

i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old. i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters (and the star trek universe, in general). even in "the undiscovered country" i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release. however, having said that, "star trek v: the final frontier" is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew. i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk, spock and mccoy is well handled, but the overall script, the direction -- by william shatner -- and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. this is a "buddy movie" and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie. the action sequences are not sustained and therefore, build little or no tension. the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs, both intended and not-intended. the klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought. the whole "sha-ka-ree" concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill, a fine actor in everything else i've ever seen him in, boarders on the absurd in this movie. the scene where sybok conjures up images of spock's pain and mccoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we've known them. spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy, trying to save his father is full of insipid, redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelley's acting abilities. the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. i understand that shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that doesn't allow for such a bad story. in some respects, i think this story does fit in with the old series, but the movies, including "star trek: the motion picture" are all much better quality than this. it's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. the focus on kirk, mccoy and spock is nice, but way over used. the old crew really seems to be out of character. i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar. i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. if this was a tv episode, i'd be able to accept a lot of the faults. as a movie, this is just bad, uninspired film making. it's a shame too, because i want this movie to be good. even if it was the level of "star trek iii" i would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare.

welcome to the plan 9 from outer space of star trek movies. come on, trekkers, admit it. this movie is so bad, so staggeringly inept in every department, it's become something of a classic.the shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid. "boones! hi, bones" brilliant! this isn't just ham - it's several large pig farms in kentucky! the "special" effects. should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term. the enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. really! even the star trek tv show had better.bones, spock and the shat sing! yeah, spock sings row row row your boat. after struggling over the meaning of the words!!!! "capt. life is not a dream" poor leonard nimoy, he must really want to strangle shatner for this. could the shat not have given us his rendition of mr. tambourine man, or harmonised with nimoy on ballad of bilbo baggins? sorely disappointed.a sean connery look-a-like plays spock's half-brother. only cos they couldn't get sean connery! uhura does a fan dance! that would have been sexy in 1966. in 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a christmas party.cat woman jumps on shatner's back! shat twirls her around a few times like a wwf wrestler, and chucks her off. yayy the shat! seems connery 2.0 was a bit of a vulcan rebel. which explains why spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. mccoy apparently mercy-killed his dad, but afterwards they found a cure. tell me this isn't hysterically funny.the 11 deck enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. spock's antigrav boots amazingly support bones and the shat as well. should also have used em on the humped-back whales in star trek iv! shatner meets god! or what purports to be god, but i assume is really some kind of alien being. god looks a bit like charlton heston in the 10 commandments. sean connery the 2nd calls on god to share his pain, and promptly dies. or something. god punishes the shat for questioning his identity. so spock kills god with a photon torpedo. i'd love to know what jehovah's witnesses made of this scene.the shat, having killed god, promptly goes back to his sing-song with spock and bones. altogether now, row row row your boat.....

much like final fantasy, if you look at a still shot - it doesn't look so bad. but when the people start moving, it's utterly horrifying. uneven jerky motions, frightening lack of emotion, and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps. the characters do not even appear alive/organic.i saw a preview screening with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! she was not at all engaged. for the record, i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar-esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2d films like sinbad.the lighting is painful, giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. the lip syncing is bad - worse actually than final fantasy. i also seriously question having hanks play five characters.... this was a major distraction throughout the film. the role of the conductor is eerie - although in a way i just can't pinpoint. it reminds me of my father's fake "phone" voice when greeting clients.i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting - you are accutely aware that the voice is the same, but yet distinctly different. it gives each character the feel of being acted, as opposed to being real human characters. the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks. i've seen the technique work - a la eddie murphy, but hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone, given the horrifying animation.i would not waste my money on this - wait for the rental.

the polar express. director robert zemeckis, i love back to the future, forrest gump, contact, and who framed roger rabbit (no question mark after that movie title!!). and tom hanks, one of my favorite actors. the reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. ebert & roeper give it two enthusiastic thumbs up! even ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! wow... ok... this i gotta see! but wait... the motion capture used looks really weird. hmm... maybe i'm not so interested in seeing this anymore."well, you comin?" says the train conductor to the boy in the polar express. the boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on its course without him. the boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time. now, most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the tv train or rental express (hee hee, i'm so witty and clever). i, on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about. i just wasted $10 and two hours of my life. i can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. the polar express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny. there's no story. there's no pay off. you sit there through these series of events and you wonder "is there any point to all this?" it'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining... but they're not.this movie is void of any emotion, any soul, any ounce of plausibility, and most of all: any fun. this movie is not fun. and let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. saying that it's the same technology (motion, i'm sorry, "performance" capture) used to make gollum is a real shame because gollum was believable!!! photo-realism just does not translate well in this medium. you're using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? or why not just film it all with real actors? they certainly could have. we as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive. caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable, as the incredibles has proved. the result of the polar express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets. they're moving and talking, but where's the heart? where's the soul? that's what we're seeing on the screen. ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh! this movie is so horrible! there's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it. he wants to give it to her but you sit there going "why??!" just leave it.. she's coming back! he of course loses the ticket and "adventure" ensues. and then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids? and then there's this annoying "know it all" kid with the voice of a 35 year old. it's all so very disturbing. oh and there's songs! one girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is. he's singing a song to himself. and then she interrupts and joins in! they end the song as they're holding hands, looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers. very awkward. i won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. "keep it hot keep it hot!" the one scene where tom hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably bad scenes in the history of bad scenes. i have to stop now or i'll just kill myself. i need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette. yes... crappy is better than the polar express. "the one thing about trains, it doesn't matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to get on."don't get on this one. for the love of god, i have decided for you! this is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form. it happened with the grinch and the cat in the hat and those were horrible also. but who can blame them? i bet if i took the book, the berenstein bears' too much junk food, and turned that into a feature film, it'd probably be pretty dull also. but at least... there'd be a story and a point, which is what the polar express is so lacking of.

this movie is awful. it creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. not to mention the yiddish speaking elves. the book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.the animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by hollywood.the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.

"the polar express " was an awful movie .what makes this movie worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as a innocent ,sugary and harmless tale for children about the "true " meaning of christmas . i never read the book of chris van allsburg in what it was inspired ,but the most disappointing is that it was directed by robert zemeckis ,the same who made the great "who framed roger rabbit?",a excellent movie where he proof that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults equally ,while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to create impressive level of detail than a interesting story .i'm sorry to say this ,but "the polar express " have so much artistic level as a publicity campaign of a video -game or toy . everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless : the characters could look like humans ,but they don't have nothing of life on them ,and they have a malevolent touch in their eyes .but the worst ...is the "message" in this movie .you could see it at some parts of the movie ,and believe me ,it was vile .take for example one scene ,where one kid refuses to enter to the polar express . notice that the character that looks like tom hanks makes a gesture like saying "you are stupid to don't accept my offering " .second ,when the girl says that the toys are so "warm " and things like that . all the damn movie the kids keep talking about how big would be the gifts that santa would give to them . there is even a song about the gifts !the vagabond is a irrelevant and weak character . and ,in the last scene the character seems to "discover " the true meaning of christmas : and what would be ? what do you think ? the gifts ! many christmas movies are close to say something like it ,but "the polar express " it's a ode to the materialism and greed . seriouslly ,i refuse to call it a "children's movie " , because if is that what the kids would learn ,i don't want to think how would be our future .

i borrowed this on dvd from a friend the other day. i didn't really know what to expect. i haven't seen a lot of russian movies, and i don't think i've ever seen a russian war movie. maybe that made me expect something different, something more along the line of an imagined russian mentality. but whatever those expectations came from, they were put to shame as this is a quite ordinary war movie.the whole formula of following a few young people from their recruitment, through training, to deployment and through some battles, is well known. we have seen it done both many years ago, as well as more recently (as with jarhead). sure, there's a difference here because the movie is about russian soldiers instead of americans as is almost always the case. but in general this could just as easily have been a vietnam-movie. i guess that just underscores my feeling that afghanistan was the soviet unions vietnam. a country that should have been a pushover for a superpower made the war drag on for years with terrible loss of life both for soldiers and civilians.the good points in this movie i felt were good photography (there are some beautiful ambiance shots) and decent effects for what i guess must have been a rather low budget movie. what made me disappointed is mostly the story itself. it just doesn't manage to stir any emotion in me. mostly because the character development is lousy. and to really feel something when people are gunned down you have to make them people, not just faceless cardboard cutouts. they fail to do that in this movie. also it's overly long, and that seems to a kind of trend lately. in my opinion a movie that's more than two hours long has to have a lot to offer, and this movie doesn't cut it. also there is a disturbing music that's put like a wet blanket over every scene. especially in the action scenes this is highly disturbing, not that you need action-music but something more than just slow keyboard-music would be nice. otherwise the production values were good enough, that was not where the problem was.i don't know how to view this movie. as a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, war sucks? that russian film-makers have already watched too many american war-movies to make something original? regardless of which, this movie is rather clichéd, lacks in spirit and while it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks in script and character development. in the end it just becomes another of all those war-movies that fails to make you think, and fails to add something to the genre. i've seen a lot worse, but a lot better too. i rate this 4/10.

okay, first of all, i missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie, so i missed credits and stuff. so when i finally got to it, i was like "who the hell is this dude?". i found out it was flex like hours after watching the movie. flex didn't look like michael jackson. not one bit. he couldn't dance like him, or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice. people commented on elizabeth taylor, but i can't really comment on that because i don't know much about her. the whole movie was like just plain wack. the dialogue sucked. the cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked. the soundtrack sucked. the acting sucked. yes even flex...i'm so upset about it though. i didn't want it to suck. i'm so sad that flex got told he can get away with it. but the whole thing looked like dress-up. you know? it's like, nobody looked like they were supposed to except for joseph jackson. the concert sequences just sucked. i'm sorry, but flex just can't dance like michael. i mean, like what the hell was vh1 thinking? the makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever michael was going through. for example, in the movie he was still dark when neverland got raided the first time around. in real life, mj was white as hell. there was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring. the movie wasn't boring, well for me it wasn't. it wasn't really anything. i was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it. i wanted to see how it turned out and if flex could redeem himself. he didn't, really. the only part i found like a bit interesting was the whole lisa marie thing. when they fell in love. that was nice. but i had to turn my face away when they kissed. heh. and only two parts made me collapse with laughter. the first time was when they cut from michael with short hair, you know the thriller era, to michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era and he was still black! that was funny. the second time i laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of michael but they had flex's face instead! it was so funny. overall, this movie was cheap trash. it was simply two hours of dress-up and could have been so much better. but no, vh1 is cheap. watch if you want. but this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it. i came out of it feeling angry. and when i found out it was flex, i just started to feel so bad. so...watch if you want.

even though i sat and watched the whole thing,i must say it was not good.it was all over the place,with big chunks of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at some bits too.if you know nothing about michael , you wont understand a thing.you have to rely on your current knowledge of the man in order for some bits to make sense..acting was a bit dramatic, flex alexander looked nothing like michael which was a put off for me and towards the end he literally looked grey.saying that portraying michael as somewhat naive but highly positive, gentle and loving individual was okay even though they still made a fool out of him time to time.if you want to watch mj's life story check out "an american dream". it is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to "bad" era. i have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of mj's life story, cos michael you rock ;-) !!!!

the writers and creators of this film should actually be sued... for polluting the world with this crap! "man in the mirror" is in fact beyond horrible! way, way, way beyond! ...and people, i'm not just saying that because i'm a michael jackson-fan! or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life i've ever encountered! i'm saying it because this is a waste of time, money and celluloid! i feel ashamed of myself just having seen all of it! that's 1 hour and 26 min of my life i'll never get back! i'm telling you; watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this film! consider yourselves warned!

this movie is like so many biopic tv movies i have seen: formulaic, exaggerating, poorly acted, and most importantly, happening too soon.what i mean by that is the movie was filmed and, for that matter, aired before michael jackson's acquittal from his child molestation charges, which i think was one of the most significant periods of jackson's life and career so far. it probably would have made a great ending to this docu-drama. however, this movie already bites off more than it can chew, cramming too many details in this overly ambitious project.it's no doubt that michael jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician, let alone modern day pop star, to date, and his story would probably take six behind the music specials to tell accurately. this movie tried to tell too much in three hours, and needless to say, it failed.flex alexander did what he could in playing jackson, but he came off more like an snl caricature by the likes of tim meadows and amy poehler. it would admittedly be pretty hard to find someone who accurately portrays jackson without meeting with the king of pop himself and studying his methods of madness. on a shoestring budget, though, one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and those do not necessarily give an accurate representation.furthermore, the director's efforts to make alexander look like jackson are completely foolish. the caucasian makeup on alexander's face makes him look more like a reverse minstrel show, and everyone who has been in a grocery store knows that jackson's nose is not as big as alexander's. it's also amazing to me that the film documents jackson going under the knife to get cosmetic surgery, yet in the next scene, alexander still has the same size nose. this kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects can't hold up to tv viewers in the 21st century.it was even more distracting when footage of the real michael jackson (i.e. the time he hung his infant child over a balcony in germany) was interspersed into the movie in real time. it was a nice try, but it just didn't work.if this movie as it is was released into theaters, it would gain a profit only because of its tackiness. it even pales in comparison to "mommie dearest", and that's saying a lot. above all, this was a movie that was probably rushed into making, like many tv movies that aren't on hbo. it could have been done a lot better if it had just told of one aspect of jackson's life. even if it just covered the child molestation allegations, it probably would have been done a lot better and would have even been more intriguing.

this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. sure, the effects are laughable, the story confused, but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun. i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what little suspense was mustered. give it a 3.

porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has glen jacobs (kane from wwf/wwe/ whatever it calls itself nowadays) in his cinematic debut. he plays jacob goodknight, a blind serial killer who's forte is taking people's eyes out. the plot, be it as it may, has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that goodknight resides in and subsequently being offed by him. hemmingway it's not. starts of as fun dopey b-movie, but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable. glad i went in with pretty low expectations, but even those weren't met. how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity??? for shame.my grade: d- eye candy: samantha noble bares her ass briefly

ok, lets start with the best. the building. although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting. other than that, its not worth it.as far as the bad, its done by wwe films. wtf? is that supposed to make you want to see it? if anything, stay away. horrible, horrible idea for them to make movies and allow gregory dark to direct it. bad choice. the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertaining.i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is. untalented actors & a disappointing, vague storyline. apparently many of the actors are from that show "all saints". its a wonder why i haven't ever heard of them or their show. other than that, the bus driver, which you never even see, just him closing the door, has had more action that just about everyone together. at least he handles stunts for some decent films.i like to see scary movies, i really do. but this one blew so much, the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through. very annoying. the child behind me was yelping more during the previews of other horror films.this is not a film to see, even less if you have to pay for it.

i had no idea this movie was produced by "wwe". wrestling is lame enough. why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was?? i found it to be a complete disappointment. if i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was, i would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. sure, i'll give them the credit of the cool effects; but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have been. he lacked a number of things. but i'll let you point them out for yourselves. the plot was a great idea, just could have been done in a much better way. maybe in the future, wwe will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry..

i got stuck in traffic (i live in sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see superman returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie playing was "see no evil", there was no poster up for it, and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out...as soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gonna be awful. the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on, and i've seen "the ringer"...okay, i would have walked out of that one, but i was too busy sleeping. the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just stupid.

another movie with a star of a wrestling. so far i have noticed....wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. this movie is no exception.the action is dreadful. it makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid. the acting is horrible, possibly from the bad director.the plot was stupid....just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals, and they get randomly killed off. the movie is stupid all the way through, making it one of the worst i have ever seen.the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way jacob goodnight dies. the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome.overall this is a really horrible movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.

after watching this movie, i have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film. for one, as a general comment, the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichés all around. the same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. the acting was terrible as well with kane showing, throughout the entire movie, at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions. even the use of modern special effects failed, as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart. overall, i would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature, as it will most surely waste 83(not even 90!) minutes of your life.

the first official release of world wrestling entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror/slasher movie called "see no evil" starring kane, one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence, hard-hitting moves, and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. and let's not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by wwe), it goes without saying that after having seen this movie, i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time."see no evil" sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. of course, a monstrous murderer (played by kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. without giving away too much of the movie plot, this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact, but without any of the scares that those films accompany. and that's sort of the main problem with "see no evil". it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. it's too generic to be scary.the movie's gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially, but as you get towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly. the death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable, although some of them are pretty inventive.and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too, as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. some can't even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. so when they die, it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kane.as for kane, he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. there's no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. he has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work with.now, despite what may seem like a harsh review, i actually enjoyed the film. it's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. my main gripe with the film, again, is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. i enjoyed it, but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. if that happens because it was supposed to be that way, the movie would have been rated higher. but it didn't. it got laughs because it's a b-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. nonetheless, i enjoyed it tremendously.if you don't mind a fun b-movie or funny horror film, i'd highly recommend "see no evil." if you are a true enthusiast of the genre, i'd wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out. everyone else should probably go watch something else.

a really very bad movie, with a very few good moments or qualities.it starts off with pregnant linda blair, who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks, i'm not sure. she jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! on the island already are david hasselhoff and his german-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff...). he's taking photographs, and she's translating an esoteric german book about witches, i think.also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman i thought was their daughter. evidently she was an architect, and linda blair and the boy are the older couple's children. i guess they all traveled to the island together, but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately).the hotel seems neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it isn't used to any great effect. an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes, which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorder.people start getting killed, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. some of these gore scenes are ok, but not enough to recommend the movie. though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots, since we're not seeing anything ourselves. the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone. he looked particularly nasty. there's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed. i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions).in the weird, largely italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also aka la casa 4 and ghosthouse 2. that is, it is supposedly a sequel to casa 3 - ghosthouse, la (1988) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). la casa 1 and two were the evil dead (1981) and evil dead ii (1987) - again unrelated to witchery and la casa 3 (and much better than those). there's also a casa 5, la (1990) aka house 5, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house: house (1986) house ii: the second story (1987), the horror show (1989) aka house iii, and house iv (1992). how's the horror show fit in there? it doesn't really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. oddly, the horror show is also aka horror house, and la casa 5 is also aka horror house 2. does your head hurt yet?

im hoping this was made before half past dead and exit wounds because it was rubbish, seagal wasnt to blame it was down to the crap directing when the few action scenes took place. the plot was also confusing and basically just felt rushed out, maybe it was shelved and released to capitalise on seagals newer films??3/10he's not through yet, bring on under siege 3 and loose some weight!

this has got to be the worst steven segal movie i have ever watched (even worse than eco-piffle like on deadly ground & fire down below). i'll start with the good points..., it's got stylish direction for a dtv movie and has wonderful scenry... that's it! the story dosen't really go anywhere, it's just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys (the body count can easily match tarantino at his bloodiest!). the plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are. the acting (i use the term loosely) is mediocre at best, seagal's usual one constipated expression and wooden acting i can take but the others especially the brits were down right terrible.what's in the package? why are bad guys after it? is seagal being set up?who gives a s***!when i rented this movie at my local blockbuster (once i'd paid) the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop i could have picked! (i felt like punching him till my arm went numb)anyway, i haven't seen half past dead or out for a kill yet and i daren't go back for more humiliation at my store, but they can't be anyworse than this turkeythe soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip - it just gave me a suuden urge for half a dozen asprins.all in all this is seagal at his worst! the guy who's gained about 100ibs and looks well past it, he's a guy who just doesn't no when to stop, he should retire gracefully now! and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something.my rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)

when you watch a seagal movie, you expect good action. you expect fighting, not just a lot of shooting like in this flick. and: you expect a rather simple story. ok, i can live with a more complex story even though it's a seagal movie. but this one, this is, i don't know what to say. it's very, very confusing indeed. at the end of the movie, i had major problems figuring out what had happened. and i know i'm not the only one. the story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's happening in the movie. there are many people in the movie, people change sides all the time, and it switches locations too often. terrible. i just don't understand why it looks like seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one.

the foreigner is a straight-to-video steven seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in march, 2003, an intention which was reportedly reversed when seagal's prior film (half past dead) tanked at the box office. according to some reports, the film had a lavish $20 million budget, including location shoots in warsaw and paris, and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to a two-picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of exit wounds seemed to indicate that seagal still had a solid following.despite the size of their investment, sony screen gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie. it is nearly incomprehensible. what am i saying? it is incomprehensible. i don't think i understood what was going on at all, except in the very broadest terms.seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy. other mysterious guys try to stop him. other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him. other really, really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff, all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out. the intended recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. because he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband, seagal at first defies the wife, then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas, as well as from her husband.many people have mysterious, cryptic conversations. many people blow each other's brains out. some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result, so the audience sees somebody die, but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill. allegiances shift often, adding further mystery. or should i say confusion?i don't know who was on whose side, or what anybody really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition. at the end of the movie, i just sat there thinking, "that's the end? what the ...?"i couldn't even figure out the credits. imdb says that aussie actress kate fischer (from "sirens") was in this film, but i'll be damned if i know where. either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project. she could have found some activities more beneficial to her career, like having unnecessary surgery, ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines, or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry.seagal used to be a pretty fair hand-to-hand combatant, but the action scenes didn't manage to redeem this film at all. seagal is in his 50's now and is a very large man, so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his inchoate brandoesque girth. he might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars, although that's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth.steven seagal seemed to be making a comeback with exit wounds, but if his last film was half past dead, this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half.

i've watched a lot of tv through the years. so much, that when i start seeing new shows that basically seem like reruns of old shows, i get insulted. luckily, i am not too sensitive because all "hot properties" does is updates the cast (meaning make them sexier)of "designing women" and drops them in new york city instead of georgia.the jokes are more tv-14-ish, but it does not make the show any better. the only thing that this show has proved is that nicole sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like "my mother the car" a classic. her comic talents remind one of a modern day lucille ball--only funnier. unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy which might be good for some brainless soap, but they just aren't funny.fred

this movie is so bad there are not words to describe it. if i got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this. the plot is so dull and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning. the best part of the movie was when the credits roled and i got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was james bond iii. just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap!

absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash, and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class. this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen. it totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present, so the story is just really really dull. thank god the 80's are over, and god save whatever man was actually born as "james bond iii".

for me, it just didn't seem like gi joe at all. when i watched it as a kid, i just didn't care for it. in fact the part i liked best about this one was the opening credits. they change so many facts around and turn the story around as well. cobra commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in antarctica or somewhere that is frozen. though i always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here. there is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie, but for me it just ruins what i watched the series for in the first place.

i speak badly of g.i.j.:t.m. mostly because i think it lacked something that g.i. joe had. yes it had something that g.i. joe didn't have like celebrity cameos by don johnson, and burgess meredith but i think g.i. joe: the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g.i. joe tv series had. most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now. it's a good movie but i wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world i.m.h.o. :)although violence is what g.i. joe was built on i'd say that serpentor striking duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for charlie adler's character to go out. neither was seeing golobulus remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobra-la felt was rightfully theirs.it wasn't the best way for the g.i. joe series to go out but it's better than nothing. :)

i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was: 1) whether to show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police is (i surely could add various adjectives here, but i think my point on this is clear). 2) whether to show how a twisted-minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers? 4) or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a moviethis was one of those movies, that in a way - did not disappoint me. from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award, and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time. it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end  and i was not disappointed there either. was it a complete waist of time? yes. which raises your question  why did i watch it throughout? well, i was trying to fall asleep, and i thought this was a great candidate for that, but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that

only in the hollywood audiovisual fiction world could anybody, including fbi agents, be so unbelievably stupid. the good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they're interested in, answer phones, go up stairways, all in search for a demolition expert who's out to get everybody. oh yes, and then we get the hollywood supervillain. he can be shot, even if he's got a vest on, and then fall down a long flight of steps and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. every cliché you can think of in suspense movies were used. i only watched it because yuki amami is so hot. oh,,,,but yes, it's great to see how morally superior this fbi agent is, when she's pretty certain that there's a bomb in an opera house, and she doesn't sound the alarm. who writes these scripts????????????

well now, here's the thing - for this movie to work, you'll have to accept the following - a woman who's murdered is alive again at the end of the movie, a detective stops interrogating the dead woman's fiancée because a newspaper reporter asked him not to, and that same reporter, smitten by a good looking blonde hauled into night court for suspicious behavior, winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook. are you following me on this? i can't tell you how many times i paused and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that just didn't make any sense. in the end, the blonde (claudia dell) and the reporter (richard hemingway) remained married, but i have no idea how they came to that decision. in fact, i can't figure out how the film maker came to the decision to make this flick. oh i suppose there's some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all, but it would have been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit. still, i'm not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list. i think that night club scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it. but why was it in the movie? i just don't know.

this film was actually shot and made in 1987 but it didn't hit the theaters until 1990. as i watched this film i could see the good intentions that it had but i'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work. story takes place in california in the 1890's and some italian immigrants who own vineyards are told they have to leave their land so a railroad can come through. dennis hopper plays william berrigan who has offered money for the land but has been turned down. giancarlo giannini is sebastian collogero and he is to proud to leave and asks the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land. berrigan grows impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to vacate. these thugs are headed by a man named andrews (burt young) and he doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him problems. andrews and his men kill collogero one night and his son marco (eric roberts) vows to seek revenge and get the land back for everyone. marco blows up the bridge that the railroad was going to need and they also destroy a tunnel and this sets back the project for several months and berrigan now starts to get heat from other investors. this film was directed by peter masterson and besides "the trip to bountiful" he has at best a spotty career in directing. he's a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head. this was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and its easy to see that it didn't occur. roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980's but this is suppose to be 1890! the cinematographer is toyomichi kurita who ended up being a good cameraman but this was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time. its not a sharp looking film at all and i noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be glaring off of something and the scenes just don't have the crispness that would have helped the overall look. the script is just a revenge story and no surprises take place during the course of the film. we know giannini is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time. the cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired. this was promoted as julia roberts film debut but i'm not sure that is correct. she might have appeared in a film called "firehouse" before this.

this was obviously a low budget film. it shows in every scene. what is nice to see is where it was made. a lot of the film was shot in columbia, ca, in the sierra nevada mountains near sonora, ca. some of the film was also shot in jamestown, ca, very near columbia. there is a railroad museum in jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "high noon" was also shot in jamestown, as was "back to the future iii".

this was pretty bad. pedestrian work or worse. i don't think it was homophobic, just really bad. if anything it was really amateurish, like when you're 14 and first discover curse words and skin mags.the main point of this movie, the romance, falls really flat. i can't help but wonder if the writers ever had any serious relationships before this movie.plotting and pacing are horrible, going nowhere at all. one minute we're watching these guys catch cheaters, then we're at a gay club, then we're at a date. out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics, and then they sleep together. none of this feels real, like an elementary school production of shakespeare if hamlet was written by a frat boy.the ending was some kind of creepy over the top revenge fantasy by a loser who got dumped by a girl. unnecessary and actually kind of disturbing.still, you have to watch it. why?as others noted the director's commentary actually is hilarious - what kind of of professional talks about "banging" or "hooking up" with the actresses? dialogue sucked, relationships lacked chemistry. you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass.

they should make terrorists watch this video as torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy. about a half hour of this would convince even the staunchest fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than sit through even one more minute of this disaster.this movie is awful. i rented it because a friend said it was hilarious, only to find he was talking about the blowhard director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself. i guess if you find unrestrained arrogance funny, you'll like this. it apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks he's "banged", the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screen.actually cj stacy was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile. this apparently is the only movie she's done according to imdb, i hope she is involved with theatre or indie stuff as i think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production.

this so called movie is horrible! the actors cannot act. there is no plot. i believe they need to start from scratch and film again. i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie. i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again. maybe there is hope for it. i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job. the wardrobe could have been much better. sorry, but this just did not do it for me. i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but... this one i cannot find entertaining. i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film.

let's see how many ways you can insult my gender: 1. of course girl #1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and sounds/looks like a heroin addict.2. of course girl #1 sleeps with the guy on the first date after getting wasted.3. of course the lesbians are butch "germans" who are into s&m.4. this one was actually a surprise. ending the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sickening. seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy.5. director's commentary - talking about hooking up with actresses in the movie, just so you know, is crass and incredibly unprofessional.

i was completely mislead by the comments on this film, mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it. expecting this to be a nice run of the mill american pie style film, i was deeply disappointed.firstly the camera work is awful, i don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the actors move close up and far away of their own accord.secondly the scenery! my god i've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest. the club was totally unconvincing with around 3 extras dancing in the back ground at any one time. the flats were bare and lacked personality.thirdly the actors. wow. the director obviously went for the typical "reaper" character set up, a wimpy main character with a gruff "i don't give a f**k" character that takes pot shots at the main. everything the main character said and did was a chore, so much so it made me wince.overall the plot, the supposedly big revenge theme, lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. the characters acted irrationally and didn't seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. no character had any depth to them, they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camera.a truly horrible piece, worse than a first year students 2 minute short for youtube. advice to the director? change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in ohio.

how many disaster movies can there be before we get tired of them. come on, we can see them on the discovery channel all day long.i agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera. the great predictor's grandson makes a prediction and everybody starts moaning about how he is ruining the family name. the evil mother-in-law convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress, whom she wants to meet. can you believe that? the wife wants to approve the new wife! at the same time the mistress' has someone in love with her that doesn't have a wife, but she sends him packing.now, that the soap opera is over, the earthquake appears.the special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. that is why i like subtitled films. the actors are all very experienced and have won many awards, so you will get to see some of japan's best in an oft-repeated story.but, the soap-opera story returns with a kitchy ending.

geologist realizes a big earthquake is coming but no one will listen. whats worse is his father in law had predicted the 1923 tokyo disaster and he's been called unworthy to be his successor. of course the big one comes and tokyo is knocked flat.a poorly dubbed japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half. the second half- after the earthquake destroys a model city its an escape drama. there are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by undercutting the action by too many poor miniatures or by having people do unreal things. hokey and not very good it has an ending you won't believe...

remnants of an ambushed army unit hook up with a group of cowboys to fight their way through indians on the warpath. sounds like it could be an exciting western, but this one is dull, dull, dull. it moves like molasses, the action scenes are uninspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography isn't very good. eastwood, in a very early role, plays an ex-confederate who doesn't like the idea of fighting on the same side as yankees. that's about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie, but eastwood wasn't experienced enough an actor to pull it off, and his character comes across as petulant rather than angry or embittered. a very ordinary western. actually, a very less-than-ordinary western. worth a look if you're a die-hard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career. otherwise, don't bother.

first of all, katherine hepburn is badly miscast as clara. she just can't be convincing as the devoted, selfless, rather smarmy wife that the writers have created.but the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great piece of drama. schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder amounts to "oh, oh, i have a headache" and the occasional angry word. suicide? the word is used, but there's no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital he's calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic. a superficial treatment. and brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his gruff humour, his love of tweaking the noses of the establishment, no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in brothels. and was clara's long concert career entirely about promoting robert's music, or was she, in fact, a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself, a female pianist carving out a place for herself in a male world? any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none, but this is a standard hollywood, middle-of-the-road approach, particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic, so much more interesting, so much more human.

this movie is standard goofy sci-fi fare from the 50s. in its favor, the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. but come on now, if aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? why wouldn't they just suck it out of a star!?!? the only credible reason for the presence of kronos is a direct attack on earth society, not the mere collection of energy. nothing like that is even intimated; kronos may have been built by a superior race but its activities on earth are the most primitive. the end that the scientist-heroes plan for kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. it amounts to the "reverse the polarity" gambit which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself. low and behold, this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. no one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy (which by the film's end includes, among other things, the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. and unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the surroundings are the suburbs of los angeles. whoops!

i first saw this movie at a saturday matinee when i was very young. i thought it was cool and often thought about it. well i finally resaw it on dvd. it was still very entertaining but in a different way. it has to rank as one of the goofiest, campiest, 1950's sci-fi movies. it seemed filled with stock military footage. the dialogue is stilted and effects are crude. there is one line of dialogue that had me in stitches. the line jeff morrow says while on the beach with the babe. rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends. it is a classic.

i once heard this movie described as either you'll love it or you'll hate it. from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings, i would venture to say that this is true. i am placing myself in the hate it crowd. i have seen some truly bad movies, boring movies, and even low budget movies. this movie is bad on all three fronts.this island earth's exeter (jeff morrow), returns to his sci-fi/b-movie roots as dr. les (minus giant head prosthetic). the doctor and his assistant arnie (george o'hanlon - aka the voice of george jetson), along with les' girlfriend assistant vera, are tracking a meteor. this is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date. les has vera and arnie has his "susie" (synchro unifying sinometric integrating equitensor - aka the computer). lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid, rosie, (and his relationship with "susie") is more believable than the cold, clam-like feelings vera has for les (and vice versa). the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor, however. it is really an alien art nouveau/art deco energy storage device, which moves around like a 3 legged dog. there is also the little alien "energy" being that controls dr. hubbel (aka, the chief scientist there). the alien is obviously and from the get-go, malicious and evil. is this the kind of science we are handing out? no wonder the aliens from the explorers were afraid of us. from watching some of these movies, we shoot first. there's no need for questions afterwards. the whole movie is synonymous with watching some really boring science experiments, like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery. its not the fact that this is a low budget sci-fi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated. it is really, really, really boring. the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on. that is it. most of the things we learn about what's going on are through monologues and self dictation. now add crappy dialog, cardboard acting and cheap-sets and you have the makings of an ed wood clone (by the way, ed has made some really boring movies as well - please avoid the orgy of the dead). the dialog ... oh, the dialog. jems such as :"..from under 2 miles of ocean ?why not ?! it came through a billion miles in space."or"do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who's probably pulled the scientific boner of all time ?"this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet, this island earth, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits, twilight zone. namely, a low budget sci-fi movie (or tv episode) that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations. at the core, these movies are enjoyable on some level (the story, the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations). this movie has none of that. it is just 90 minutes of boredom. i couldn't even enjoy this on a ed wood level. i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead. it is so bad, that if my name was dr. forrester, i would never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except frank maybe.

jeff morrow is leslie gaskell, barbara laurence is vera hunter, and john emory is hubbel eliot. along with some ancillary air force personnel and a comic geek, they are in charge of a super-secret underground laboratory on the west coast. morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the pacific ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the mexican coast.nobody knows what this colossal, blocky structure is. obviously it's some kind of carpentered artifact because it's all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on top.it turns out that the machine, dubbed kronos, is from some far-away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy. you see, here on earth, we have learned how to convert matter into energy, but on kronos' planet they have figured out the other half of the equation -- how to convert energy into matter. and now they're running out of energy on the other planet. are you taking notes on this? good.maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by kronos' mission. for instance, if kronos' builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why don't they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to extinguish la's lights? but it's doubtful the writers could explain it either. reversing the polarities of two antenna is described as an "anthropic conversion," which means a "towards-human change", which doesn't make sense. but it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter. the diagram that morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction, from positive to negative.there's a problem with kronos' locomotion too. it marches along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (read southern california), but it has no joints in its two or three legs. these stumps just thump slowly up and down, squashing some people. the film doesn't make much of these squashed people. they're shown as mexican peasants, so maybe they don't count for too much. the usaf also drops a hydrogen bomb on kronos -- while it's in mexico, mind you. nobody raises an eyebrow.not much acting is called for and not much is given. jeff morrow has a distinct and resonant voice, great for radio or for tv voice overs. his face is less expressive. he has only one expression, no matter what the situation is -- a tight smile, as if he's having his picture taken at the universal studios tour. barbara laurence had a fine, golden quality when she made "street with no name" a few years earlier. she was a slender seventeen-year-old as richard widmark's wife. here, her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of b-movie actress, though she's still beautiful. it's always good to see morris ankrum in one of these movies. he's made so many, i get them mixed up.on the whole, the film comes across as flat, i'm afraid. (there are some nice shots of a b-47 in flight, though.) the sets reveal a low-budget enterprise. that's not necessarily bad in itself, but there's nothing to make up for the barren settings. little tension in the script, no directorial display, and little effort put into the performances.you might get a kick out of it -- a relaxed high -- because this is distinctly unchallenging. it's just that there are so many better films of the genre out there.

some nameless aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot kronos to rob the world of its energy. they've got a prototype clanking around mexico for openers and if he proves successful more will be sent. it would certainly take a lot of time for just this one kronos to perform that task.for reasons i can't explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist john emery who telepathically directs kronos to his first targets. since emery is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without emery as a controller, why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre.in any event scientists jeff morrow, barbara lawrence, and george o'hanlon who work under emery aren't fooled a bit about his nature. and of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giant.kronos is a perfect film for the fifties, the bad guys are never seen they're just out there looking to undermine mankind. it's a perfect film for the cold war. and jeff morrow assures us we'll be ready for them in the future.the players look like they're having a grand old time mouthing as many clichéd lines the writers could put in the script. i get the impression that kronos is the kind of film ed wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care.

we chose to see this movie as an alternative to the polar express showing at our local imax theater. what a waste of time and money! first, it is not cute. the snowman, at times, looked demonic. other times, he was simply a zombie. he showed no expression or emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy.secondly, santa states in the beginning it's a movie about the spirit of giving. santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? i'm all for a little parody, but this just wasn't funny or entertaining.the idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute...not even a "thank you" to santa.the only funny parts of the movie were the "outtakes" at the end of the film. too bad they didn't use them in the movie. it would have been better.

yes.a real stinker. i saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "psychological" movie. this film makes every effort not to be understandable. i was aware that i was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutes.i waited since i expected to see something valuable, and most important of all, i paid for this film. the wait was unbearable. after seeing the film, i talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments ( they call themselves under this title ) of turkey this "movie" had recognised as a masterpiece. yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers.i think that a movie must be self-explanatory. this film is just the opposite. keep away from this thing which calls itself a "movie". burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". rate: 1 out of 10

in the mountains of japan, forlorn young artist sessue hayakawa (as tatsu aka "the dragon painter") paints magnificent landscapes. he prays "divinity" will restore his fiancée, whom he believes was changed into a dragon, 1,000 years ago. meanwhile, in tokyo, an forlorn older painter, edward peil (as kano indara) laments not having a son to carry on his family line of artists. when mr. peil sees mr. hayakawa's paintings, he sees a painter worthy to become his "son and disciple." hayakawa also falls in love with peil's daughter tsuru aoki (ume-ko), believing she's the reincarnation of his long lost princess. but, with his love fulfilled, hayakawa loses his ability to paint an introduction notes, "'the dragon painter' was originally released in 1919 by the haworth pictures, a hollywood-based production company formed the previous year by sessue hayakawa, a japanese-born actor who enjoyed great popularity in the silent period. the film was ninth of twenty-two features produced by haworth, each of which was tailored to hayakawa's talents and to his stock company of japanese actors." fortunately, a print of this film was found, in france, and restored.the description, "the dragon painter is a fantasy-allegory of love and creative inspiration that is lost when longing is fulfilled," is accurate. "with its production, hayakawa intended to provide a different view of japanese culture to american audiences, avoiding the stereotyping, violence, and melodramatic conflict expected in 'oriental' films of the period." hayakawa was successful in that part of his goal; although, this film probably did not and will not appeal to most viewers, and is not the best example of its intent.**** the dragon painter (9/28/19) william worthington ~ sessue hayakawa, edward peil, tsuru aoki

i saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when i couldn't get to sleep. it didn't help in the slightest. i found myself staring up at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. i could quite happily never see this cartoon again, simply because of that face.now, don't get me wrong - i love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone. but this twisted and terrifying rendition simply is disturbing. it is mainly the cruel laughter, and the exaggerated features that terrify me, and i still have nightmares because of it. please, i urge you not to allow your children to see this. it is far, far too scary. please, i pray you, keep it away.

this movie describes a truly horrific event, to be sure. but it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast. it is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character, as all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves. for example, a character is shot at the start of the movie, and you get the clichéd desperate, "am i gonna make it, sergeant?", "yeah it ain't nothing'", but it plays out like a sketch from a wayans brothers movie (i don't know if they've made the war movie yet) or something starring leslie nielsen.the sergeant played by sean penn reminds me of al bundy from married with children, while fox is the greatest self-deprecating good-guy cliché you can imagine... thank god he curses and smokes during it.his emotional "noooo!!!" is definitely more suited to comedies like back to the future than so-called serious movies such as this.to their credit, some of the "main" scenes... (without giving too much away, where they actually perform some fairly horrific acts) ...are well done and do make us take the subject matter seriously. but that is in spite of, not thanks to the acting.

the problem with this- and with all vietnam war films- is that they're all too biased. antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of u.s. soldiers were heroes, while prowar films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie. this film sucks. it's time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar, nor liberal nor conservative, but completely unbiased.

i had great expectations surrounding this movie (not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when i saw it on cable, they were all shattered. starting by the acting (poor,almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: since when does a 5 men squad go out on patrol on a supposed «hot» zone???to suicide??that´s one big mistake, that costs the film dearly. very good actors do very poor acting here, like sean penn, that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on «i am sam», and michael j. fox, that wastes a good opportunity to beat charlie sheen on «platoon», performing just «average». but the most irritating character was diaz (played by john leguizamo, another stupid waste of fine talent by the director), that was a cheesy,scared and insecure kind of person, even more irritating that jar jar binks (yes,you heard it). the battle sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with michael j. fox trapped by his feet on a vc tunnel.mr. de palma has a weak work here, and if it wasn´t for films like «scarface» and «the untouchables» (these ones excellent films), i would consider him a «bluff» director: too much publicity, bad filming.3/10

one of the worst shows of all time. the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for. the fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors??? never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part. every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. the stories were as unbelievable as the actors. lame would be the best way to describe it. somehow this show makes a slug like ice-t more believable as a cop, and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded.

some folkie friends recommended this, but as a film it's really lacking in originality. i found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning. however, if you like traditional english/appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. i've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie, with professional musicians filling in for the actors.

i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and no-one had a good word for it.i happen to love bluegrass and country music so it's not as if i'm unsympathetic to the subject matter. but the problem is that at heart it's a very conservative movie- little more than a filmed mills and boon story. a bodice-ripper of the most simple-minded and soppy kind.it's not just that the love story at its heart, that between reece and dr. lily penleric is more than a tad unbelievable. (why any male would be attracted to the nostril-flaring man-devouring lily is beyond me, and frankly, mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motions).it's simply that the whole movie is too tame and well-mannered for its own good. there is precious little danger, dirt or drama. sure there's a moment of "excitement" involving a school run by lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic (it's just so poorly written and acted). and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved.as for good old reece kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like eberneezer bumpass?) i ask you! is the ending of this film believable? fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed? i think not...

visually beautiful with some fine music, this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-tv quality. the romance between two characters, which spans a cultural and educational divide, is simply not plausible. of course, from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up, win over the locals, and find true love, but that doesn't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns. this film had lots of promise, which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized. perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable, but i certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase. i'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.

this was a fabulous premise based on lots of factual history. but the serious lack of character development left us not really liking or caring about any of the characters, especially the musicologist! she did not get any sympathy; she seems like she deserved his own black cloud. the songs were great to a point, but became repetitive after a while.

*spoilers!* when i first saw the preview for this, it looked like a good old fashioned hallmark movie. i love bluegrass music, so i couldn't wait to see it. when we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounded even better. the film was pretty boring for the first half, every now and then a song would be played. then (i'm embarrassed typing this)a lesbian love seen came in. i that ther was something more then friendship between the teachers but i certainly didn't expect nudity and prolonged make out sessions. i was watching this with my mother and i was quite embarrassed, because i picked this movie. but besides that, it was an okay movie. the acting was fine, the actress who played deladis was great. to be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. i don't care to see the movie again but i bought the soundtrack the day after i saw the movie. and there are continuation discs that follow. if i were you, i would skip the movie and just get the music.

as a true canadian, i always avoid canadian movies. however now and then i get trapped into watching one. this one is better than most, which is to say mediocre. it has many of the usual flaws of canadian films...self-conscious acting...an excess of cinematic gimmicks and, above all, the self-effacing canadian habit of using canadian cities as stand-ins for american ones. i mean using the historic metropolis of montreal as a stand in for harrisburg pennsylvania is just short of obscene. i was in a generous mood. i gave it a 4.

first of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (not er or emt, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. on top of that, he is a comic book character---no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development. the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are. and trivett is the ultimate clown in black-face. come on---if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias, then explain why jt is treated as a dolt, always is the subject of walker's jokes, never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues walker, who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does. while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery. but then again, norris produced the show as well as starred in it, so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time. what a terrible series! it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger, roy rogers, the cisco kid, and wild bill hickock, though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows. but like those shows, in the same way as those shows, walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly.

i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country (houston, dallas, austin/san antonio etc.), they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers/cowboy hat , talks with a drawl, has zero fashion sense, and drives a truck on his way to either the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police-truck...anywhere in texas.the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy...they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference. the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away. this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high-brow entertainment. at least knightrider had the talking car.

this was an abysmal show. in short it was about this kid called doug who guilt-tripped a lot. seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth. the animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. it aired here in sweden as a part of the "disney time" show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13.i never got why some of the characters were green and purple too. what was up with that? truly a horrible show. appareantly it spawned a movie which i've never seen but i don't have any great expectations for that one either.

witchy hildegard knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. i thought i'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire. hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut...then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! "witchery" made me sick. it made my eyes hurt. i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent people...until the finale. i have to admit i loved the ending. it involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by linda blair looking fantastically possessed. the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over, but you know that old saying: "if you've got a great ending, people will forgive you for just about anything!"

in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously, and move into 'adult' films, mr. hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. true, it's got every cliche in the book in it, silly fantasy stuff and all that, but more importantly- it's got elizabeth mcgovern.clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film, she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material. kevin bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but mcgovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty. the 'teen film' fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he'd find some new material. but i keep going back to mcgoverns performance, because it's truly moving. mr. hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them (some kind of wonderful, breakfast club) and when his material bumps up against a true talent, some wonderful things can happen. if only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff.

warning, spoilers ahead (even if i doubt that anybody hasn't seen this yet)the movie starts off rather well, but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny, sugary sweet, predictable and unrealistic 'harmony romance' mess. i mean, it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage, but these problems are never solved but just forgotten.basically, as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back (without even asking) all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation. given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and cliche' 'having a baby will change everything' ending.the two main characters' families and neighbours are also extremely one-dimensional, and don't seem to serve really any purpose if not to irritate the viewer, and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the 'harmony moments' start.i am sorry to be ripping this movie, but given the start i would have expected something more. 4/10 for me.

dustin hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's reputed to be; a spanish/italian co-production filmed in italy with the director using the pseudonym "dan ash"(!), the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a $1,000,000 hidden by gangster cesar romero (who, despite being third-billed - after elsa martinelli and hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!).hoffman's performance, obviously, is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz - an accident-prone american treasury agent of sicilian descent (named puzzu, which nobody seems to be able to get right!) sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain "inconspicuous" but, instead, is forever getting into trouble - though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot, foiling the crooks and winning the girl (martinelli as romero's daughter, who's somewhat wasted here)!! still, the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster riccardo garrone: apart from his would-be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect, he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes! also, in view of the story being set in rome, it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a spaniard (doubtless an exigency of the co-production deal)! along the years, i've missed out on hoffman's other italian comedy - alfredo, alfredo (1972) - a number of times (i guess, mainly, because leonard maltin only rates it *1/2 in his "movies & video guide"...but, then, madigan's million gets a bomb!); with pietro germi directing and co-starring the luscious stefania sandrelli, the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable, and i really hope it turns up again on italian tv soon...

we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. well, we got it home and could not believe what we saw. its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. the main character is all over the place... one moment, he is like an immature little kid, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker.the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy, but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. nipple slips, close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. we were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. if you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch's... this is for you. if you are looking for something beyond that, this movie was empty. the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.

i'll give it this: i didn't stop watching, and it's not corporate, which is kind of cool. but my internal critic cut it to pieces -- i suppose i see too many movies. wooden script, the slang just sort of clanks out of their mouths without any kind of flow. editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel, but mostly its irritating -- jerky, quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups. the actors were marginal, though letisha had her moments.i'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis, he's a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing. the directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him, even; i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already. i didn't care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around. the completely predictable ending isn't credible at all. i'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he deposes are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams. "oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation? here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, go run it around the corner for me. now don't steal from me, etc."a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but it was let down in the end. handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-raising, if only mildly interesting. there are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film-school offering. 4/10, an f.

ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on? that is how i ran across this tripe. for myself, i would have been better served tossing and turning for the 97 minutes i wasted with this film.in its attempt to "be real" this movie's characters come off as such gangsta stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a wayans brothers movie. the dialog? please! it sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film.the editing was horrible. one of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chase down a bunch of narrow alleys. cut to the characters being chased, though, and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background.when any of our "homies" get shot in this film, he bleeds miraculously through clothes that have no holes, which is more than i can say for the plot of this predictable load of....baking soda.indie films can be great even if they are low on budget and effects, but they still need to have some cinematic integrity. if i could have given it a 0, i would. if you watch it, i hope it is on cable, because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay...

after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version. i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach. i was disappointed. i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played. maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bach's music that can explain the film. i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it, but i did not. see it at your own risk.

very stark, very drab, no real drama. why not just make a documentary? this isn't exactly the passion of joan of arc. the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances. i love bach's music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film. the great gustav leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) bach. we don't get much of a sense of him as an actor, since he's given so little to do dramatically. mostly, he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms. bach's life, of course, was not an errol flynn movie. it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard. this probably means that the life isn't a terrific candidate for a film. the music, of course, is another story. i recommend the stations of bach. far more information, for one thing, and some insight into the music, which is, after all, why bach interests us in the first place.

"witchery" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when linda blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts. the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of "the evil dead". the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.

this movie isn't even good enough for the $1 bin at the grocery store.i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it. guess he couldn't be too choosy about his roles during this time. the movie in itself was hard to sit through. it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline. the "guys night out" had to be the most boring i've ever seen. one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry? even the arguments were hard to follow. most of the acting lacked any depth.i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark.

i could not believe it. this film was a total wast of time out of my life. the title is appropriate. love didn't beat the hell out of me, this film did. i kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something, anything to happen. and nothing ever happened! nothing!! terrence howard couldn't even save this lame piece of work called a film. it was dark, and confused and i didn't get who killed the girlfriend in the end. the tone and pacing of the film was supposed to be building to a dramatic climactic ending. this only served to confuse the audience because the movie just plodded along going no where. if you want pure torture, watch this film.

in the process of boring you with the wordy, rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development, it manages to enforce a few negative black stereotypes out there. at one point i was wondering if jesse helms co-wrote the screenplay.

awful, waste of time. there is no camp or trash value in this one. seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs.how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians? it's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it.could not find anything good about the film. there was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. a few overweight goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene. nothing at all.well, cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark. purpose was probably good: make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood. problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally. it takes talent and an effort to make a "real" movie. ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort. these guys lacked everything. ed wood was a genius compared to these guys.

i have to preface this by saying that i love watching bad movies that are entertaining. this movie delivers 100%. it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen. it is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city (people walking, traffic, the skyline, etc.) that doesn't tie into anything. then there are the overly long 'sex scenes.' these involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each other's bodies. these are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie. this is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called 'barely legal' girls who couldn't be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him. no one had to memorize any lines for this movie, if they aren't clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue. then there's mr creepo. he throws ed wood's name around like he can somehow compare, but he is far far from anything of that quality. he walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on. we couldn't stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified)i give this movie a 1/10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.

bad. personal opinion? the folks who made it? they knew that when they made it. to star in this movie, again my opinion, you needed to meet three criteria ... #1: you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry. makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way. #2: you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards. note that i didn't say you had to do it well. saves on time and paper work. #3: you had to be willing to get naked. gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales. want to watch a better movie? easy. get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself. trust me, you won't do any worse. as vampire movies go, well, this one sucks. and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies ... consider the link between vampires and crosses. now, take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in. ed wood couldn't have planned that kind of an accident any better himself.

witchcraft/witchery/la casa 4/ and whatever else you wish to call it. how about..crud.a gathering of people at a massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel, torturous methods. photographer gary(david hasselhoff)is taking pictures for linda(catherine hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble ee-yor of the winnie the poo cartoon), a virgin studying witchcraft, on the island resort without permission. rose brooks(annie ross, portraying an incredibly rude bitch)is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and, along with husband freddie(robert champagne, who is always ogling other women much younger than him), pregnant daughter jane(linda blair)and grandson tommy(michael manchester, who just looks bored throughout, probably wanting to watch sesame street instead of starring in this rubbish), go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by realtor tony giordano's son jerry(rick farnsworth), obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet. along with these folks is architect leslie(leslie cumming, whose character is a nympho)who might help rose re-design the resort. the boat's captain is killed by the lady in black(hildegard knef, wearing her make-up and lip-stick extra thick)and a storm is brewing. the boat drives off by itself(..guided by the invisible power of the lady in black, i guess)with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort, which is in dire need of repairs. most of the victims, before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension(..perhaps a type of hell or something)where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage. one victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney, roasted as the others light the fireplace. one poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck. one fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge(..and bleed) and neck's blood vessels burst squirting in hasselhoff's face! one fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame. blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice. one is raped by this demonic man with a "diseased" mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering. the film, despite it's excesses, is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of hasselhoff and blair, who deserve better than this. almost unbearable at times, building little-to-no suspense. clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable. sure some gore is okay, but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer. we do get a chance to see pregnant women(..who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs) jumping out three story windows. oh, and the lady in black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see. tommy has a little sesame street recorder which tapes the lady in black's mumbo jumbo chants, obviously used for later. for some reason, the lady in black likes to visit little tommy. he's not at all scared of her, for tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face, much less fear. need i say more? this one's a real stinker. ugh.

there are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. the cut i saw has the on-screen title witchcraft: evil encounters and was released by shriek show, who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release. it's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. in italy, it was released as la casa 4 (witchcraft). the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films (retitled) and the third la casa was another film by the same production company (filmirage), which is best known here in america as ghosthouse. to make matters even more confusing, witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse 2. except in germany, where ghosthouse 2 is actually the ogre: demons 3. ok, i better just shut up now. i'm starting to confuse myself!regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. some of it is good, some of it isn't. i actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a senseless mess. a large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a german- speaking witch (hildegard knef). photographer gary (david hasselhoff), who wants to capture "witch light," and his virginal writer girlfriend (leslie cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. along comes real estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers rose (annie ross) and freddie (robert champagne) brooks. also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter jane (linda blair) and very young son tommy (michael manchester), as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland - hasselhoff's wife at the time). once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the "lady in black."so what can you expect to find here? plenty of unpleasantries! one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. there's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a sesame street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. from a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. the hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. blair (particularly at the end) and ross both seem like they're having fun and knef is great as the evil witch. even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.on the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. and while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly the "actress" who plays hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.

why lori petty was cast as tank girl, i'll never know. her acting performance is lack-luster. her voice is grating. it's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is.there are several "modern-pop" references in the film, which i found to be very strange, given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future. it wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either. some better writing would have helped loads.naomi watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno-geek. i think they should have probably switched roles.i'll never know why anyone would like this movie, unless they were a petty fan.try not to see this movie. total waste of time.

sometimes a movie cannot easily be classified. such a film is "tank girl", part cartoon, part comedy, and part action flick. i'm sure somewhere there is an audience for "tank girl', but it is extremely small, perhaps punk comic book readers. most viewers will be looking for an early exit or living with the fast forward button. the only redeeming quality are short bursts of humor "find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers", but these tiny moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the sophomoric action sequences. there is no character development, which is not surprising, since the source is a comic book. do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid. - merk

this film doesn't know what it wants to be: is it making fun of action movies in general? is it satirical? is it supposed to be a black comedy? this is truly one of the worst films ever made.lori petty is annoying. there, i said what everyone else is thinking. it's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (route 666, bates motel), but she doesn't even qualify as a mediocre b-movie actress. her screechy voice, strange mannerisms, and poor comic timing dot this film from start to finish, until you just want to put your head in a vise and end the pain.do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. you'll be glad you did.

maybe it's because i'm no fan of the comics (but if the comics are of the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. non-existent plot, laughable acting, dumb dialogue... this movie is so bad that it hurts. a lot. that some people actually gave this one 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. if you hate yourself, then watch tank girl! on another thought, if you hate yourself that much, maybe you should just commit suicide... my rating: -34/10

i made the mistake of buying this since i collect comic book inspired movies. even at 6$ it was too expensive. i thought there might be some campy fun in it, a "so bad" it becomes good vibe perhaps, i was wrong. i had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it. now i know why. i was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. i'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor but tank girl does not work on any front. the script is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one-liners. the special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live-action. it's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings, however cool they might be (an uncensored animated feature would be way better for tank girl now that i think about it). the action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b-movie way. the tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated. as a matter of fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. it does have some interesting songs by known artists such as bjork, hole and portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don't fit most of the time. once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible. i think that's when i totally tuned out. i suppose tank girl, played by lori petty, looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her "attitude" and sometimes barely amusing retorts, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters. jet, played by naomi watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. malcolm mcdowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role. it might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves (check out the entry for tank girl on wikipedia). rating: 3 out of 10

this is one of the films that killed the "spaghetti" western. it not only loses something in the translation, it is a total chaotic mess of editing as well. either chunks of it have been edited out and or re-edited for an english language version. in any case, it makes little or no sense, period. it makes the "trinity" and the eastwood "man with no name" films look like john ford/john wayne by comparison. nothing in this film is original. somewhere in there is a beginning, a middle, and (finally)an end. except for the end, not everything is exactly in that order. robert wood seems personable enough. the rest of the cast, especially the women, should have made better career choices.

this is the first film i've watched from the italian ed wood, demofilo fidani aka miles deem. the above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring richard basehart which was hammer films' michael carreras' one and only stab at the western; the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam walbash, but they called him amenalthough it was actually wallach in the italian variant which, of course, implies a tribute of sorts to hollywood actor eli! while certainly not unwatchably bad, instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that i was often cracking up into howls of laughter: a horrid number by a would-be irresistible french chanteuse; a totally irrelevant bar-room brawl; actors doing somersaults when being shot; an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine; ineffective use (indeed abuse) of slow-motion; and, easily the most preposterous, seeing gordon mitchell and lincoln tate play two gunfighters (sporting the actors' own names!) hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all!! lead actor robert woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the amens over the bodies of his victims. supporting actress simonella vitelli (actually, the director's own daughter!) as the villain's broad is quite a looker but, unfortunately, she doesn't get to do much in the film  despite having a change of heart towards the end. the main musical theme is actually pretty good but, again, the title song is, in itself, quite lousy.

i absolutely hated this movie! i was 9 when i saw it. it is the only movie i have ever walked out of in the theater. my mom, dad, and i all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. this movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life. everything about it was ridiculous. the entire premise was too warped. being 9, i was always easily entertained. this movie proved that i couldn't subject myself to anything and still be entertained.

if it were possible, i would have given this sorry excuse for a movie a zero star. it was by far the worse i have ever seen. it was as if it were a home movie that some bored highschoolers decided to make as a joke. the "acting" was horrific. the "actors" didn't even react to the fact that they were being murdered.honestly, i bought this movie by mistake. the spanish title said jeepers creepers 3, so i thought hmm maybe it'll be ok. wrong. it was honestly the worst ever. i didn't get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie. i skipped through chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen.the cameramen were also terrible. it was like a home movie. i would never recommend anyone to watch this. terrible terrible moronic movie.

this is just about the worst piece of garbage i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. the story was embarrassingly amateurish, the graphics were horrible, and the acting... i've never seen worse acting in my entire life. a kindergarten class could come up with a scarier, better written, and more entertaining concept than this. i pity anyone who wastes their time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job. it was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction. the writers must have spent their time at film school in the "back room" playing peaknuckle. a lot of professors wasted a lot of time on these two. i would be truly embarrassed to admit that i knew them.

i rented this movie under the impression that it was "scarecrow 3:dark harvest", thinking it was a continuation in the scarecrow slayer series (another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies). i wasn't disappointed though. it was just as awful, if not worse, than what i expected. i was laughing throughout the entire movie. every piece of bad acting, poorly shot and cut footage, and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting.the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and crew's six months of filming.favorite line, "the sins of my forefathers! they've trickled down to this very moment of time!"

as you may remember i have seem all three of the trilogy of trash and the first movie is the only one even remotely close to be watchable. part two was low grade sewage and this installment is slightly better then two, but still one steaming pile of something i removed from my backyard last monday. the premise doesn't make sense, why did the moonshiners murder that poor old lady and even in 1921 i think someone would notice a bunch of oily guys where a sweet little old lady once lived. second, that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first movie. it's just old clothes and a burlap sack. let's face it, the series is garbage and should be forgotten about. the noose!

i couldn't spoil this piece of crap if i wanted to. after watching dark harvest 1 i thought "this has got to be the worse movie ever made" then i watched dark harvest 2 and that made 1 seem a little better. then i watched dark harvest 3 or tried too. the only thing i have to say is "when is this going to end?" very bad acting and really bad special effects the only good thing about this movie was the boob shot. don't waste your time of money on this piece of crap... and now i have to write 3 more lines to get this to submit. i was going to sing a song but i can't think of any right now. but the movie finally ended (though it had an ending that might mean they are going to make another one of these)

ok i gave this a three a three! it deserves only one star no questions asked.if your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit b-horror movie than yes it will get one star. but i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap.with this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more "hollywood" but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish. we laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy.the acting is terrible..... the effects and death sequences are so bad.... the story complete crap.....but the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie..priceless!the most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed "dark basement" which is clearly lit, and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha just terrible.....so if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is, along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie....wait why am i writing so much? no one knows about this movie...i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.

it used to be that video distributors like sub rosa and brain damage films would release low-budget, shot-on-video horror films to a select market of gorehounds that ate them up with glee. that's acceptable to me, because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titles.now we have lions gate getting into the mix, only they have decided that it'd be better to sucker in poor saps by putting a "professional" looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higher-budget, professionally made features. do not be suckered in by this! granted, if you've seen dark harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf beside professionally-made features.i am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget, shot-on-video productions that were still a worthy rental but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the "acting" (if you can call it that) was abysmal. it was amusing to laugh at the horrible line reading for a minute or two, but eventually it was too much to take and became unbearable. the story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow manages to be even worse. the only possible saving grace to this would be one disemboweling scene that still manages to be awful but is an award winning effect when compared to the blood splatters after a girl is slapped or the mannequin decapitation.it took me three tries to make it through this entire movie and i only did so because i paid good money to rent it and felt like i should at least finish it all the way through. stay away - stay far, far away from this one.

dark harvest 3: scarecrow: 1 out of 10: in einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time. (or so i've heard) in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. even on fast-forward (and you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity.if you are familiar with lionsgate's own version of project greenlight (this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local wal-mart) you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within.the line reading (i refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. this is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of schlitz. the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene.the story is awful, the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by adhd middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words. avoid.

spoilers: the original road house is one of those movies that i know is clichéd and unoriginal, yet it's done so well, i'm embarrassed to admit i really like it. turns out many of my friends, whose movie opinions i respect, think the same way. so when they attempt to make a sequel to it and it's as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel, it's just bad; really, really bad.oddly, johnathon schaech is listed as one of the writers and i can only hope his wga membership is revoked. the writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium. schaech already appearing to be the king of the straight-to-dvd sequel (8mm 2, poison ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, i'm thinking his acting ability is non-existent. he was awful, just awful.and it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch (yet still making the "wiff" sound in the air) that is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground. this is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 1970s cop show. or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry kool-aid for some reason. and we're supposed to believe will patton is a fighting machine; his fight scenes look so amazingly fake i was honestly embarrassed watching. it's the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible. for instance: johnathon schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side she's on, "i'm with the feds, but don't tell anyone." the female villain, who fights the good girl in one fight scene with acrobatics that rival any super hero, yet is easily held down by the will patton, "old guy," in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he utters some ridiculous line ("stab me once, shame on you, stab me twice, ain't gonna happen" whew, that's bad) and then head-butts her. jake busey's villain shoots at the feds while caught in the middle of a drug deal, yet no dea agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after, in fact, he's simply let go because "this is the sheriff's territory." busey wants the bar because it's "in a great location" for drug deals, yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the perks the bar is supposed to have. johnathon schaech's character is supposed to be the son of patrick swayze's character in the original, yet swayze's character's last name is dalton and schaech's isn't (nor is the supposed brother of swayze's character). and johnathon schaech looks about 50 in this movie. i looked it up, he's 17 years younger than swayze, but he looks awful.but my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies: the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down i'm thinking "please don't tell me he's impaled on something..." and sure enough, my worst fears were realized.actually, i could go on for another half hour about the things i hated about this movie. suffice to say, let's put an end to these ridiculous straight-to-dvd sequels to theatrical movies, at least the ones with johnathon schaech.

this in-name-only sequel to the classic roadhouse has a dea agent (john schaech) coming to the rescue of his uncle (will patton) when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang, headed by that wooden indian of an actor jake busey. the gang wants to take over the poor guy's bar for nefarious reasons. patrick swayze is sorely missed here. schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass-kicking lawman. the fights here are intermittent and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in roadhouse. the finale is equally weak. some good-looking women keep things afloat for a bit. there is a terrific fight between a daisy duke-type who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons, and a nasty-looking babe of busey's who is handy with sharp implements. there's also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of schaech's, but unfortunately she never reappears in the film. too bad. she does a brief lap dance for schaech that had my full attention. if nothing else, roadhouse 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes darned close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. the rest is snooze time.

"direct-to-video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless its a direct-to-video sequel to something that went direct-to-video in the first place. despite this, studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. i don't think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time, including the hitcher ii, starship troopers 2, and cruel intentions 3. it's fitting that road house 2 was helmed by scott ziehl as he was also the man in charge of ruining the cruel intentions series. like his entry in the cruel intentions trilogy, ziehl takes elements that made the first road house a great guy flick, and rehashes them with no success whatsoever. this is no sequel, this is a remake all the way. various lines from the original are repeated, plot points cut and pasted, and scenes are replicated almost shot-for-shot from the first one. the one thing that could not be duplicated were the amazing fight scenes, which made road house what it was. here, we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour. compare that with its predecessor's fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare. ziehl is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of earth vs. the spider, but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess. it's not completely his fault, as the screenplay is very, very poorly written and clunky. i don't care if something goes direct-to-video, a good script is still required. someone should keep that mind while continuously churning these low-budget, direct-to-dvd movies out. skip it entirely. 1/10

well let's be fair. following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task. now subtract swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task. so with patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage? i am going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film. i was actually shocked they got will patton (armaggedon) to jump on board. johnathon schaech did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious. turning down his partner brunette bombshell (crystal mantecon) in the film's first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there. but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double duece. no such luck. the cover of the dvd is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film. costar ellen hollman actually puts in a decent performance as well. but again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this. has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film? could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment? even one of the old bouncers or two, or jeff healey for a performance would have been nice. take this film out of your queue immediately. -lostflix

this movie is a pile of rubbish , and to try and base it the first is just a farce , the main thing that let it down for me was the usage of the one liners out of the first one , which once said by classic actors such as sam elliot can not be reproduced in any way , i mean when dalton phones wade in the 1st , and he ends the call with stay cool that was great , but when the chump rings the dea agent back home and he ends the call with stay cool it doesn't have the same ring now really does it , there are other ones but i cant be bothered to post em up , but i hope u get my drift ,they should of named this roadhouse wannabe ..........

man stop making sequels to great movies. the original was a great movie that was over the top with fights,sex,and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 90's. the story is believable as if your been to bars in the outs of the south you would know. but here comes this piece of junk roadhouse 2 last call. lets just hope they are serious with the title and never make another roadhouse ever again.it doesn't have the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really believable. the story is more of a steven segal type action that even though roadhouse 2 is a b movie it still doesn't click as some b movie action still sales the movie no matter how cheesy it is. the only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out the one question is left from the original roadhouse. patrick swayze's character dalton, is dalton his first name or last name? well i'll save you the $4.00 rental fee. dalton is his first name as in dalton tanner. never make another roadhouse!!!!!!!!!!!

i happened to see a promo for this movie on spike channel last night, it was grouped with a patrick swazy rerun of another movie he made and thought swazy was in this sequel.....boy was i wrong....i see the screen writer also starred in it, and i'm thinking the budget was a bit tight. i am surprised to see will patton in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a "c" movie like this. bussey jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his father(one of the best bad guy actors ever) that failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie was the chicks,,,,,good looking and with lots of t&a just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it

the original road house is by no means an award winning film. but it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. it shouldn't have been that hard to make a sequel. there's no need for a big budget, big name stars, and spectacular visual effects. even the story didn't have to be original. all it needed was a good time vibe, and some great fist fights. i don't mean matrix-style "wire-fu", just some well choreographed barroom brawls. lots of them. there are a couple of decent fights in the movie, but none of them are memorable, and the focus is more on gun play. plus, the way it ties in to the original film is laughable, bordering on insulting. johnathon schaech plays shane tanner, an undercover dea agent who is good with his hands and feet. but here's the kicker...he's the son of patrick swayze's character dalton!!!! say what????? let's see, the original road house was made in 1989. so for dalton to have a son in his late 20's (maybe even 30) in 2006...well you get the idea. they give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle nate (will patton) while his father "travelled around a lot". oh please. that itself almost warranted shutting this movie off. but i digress. schaech is completely out of his element. sure he can throw a couple of kicks, but he's got nothing going on as an actor. plus, he's referred to in the movie by the bad guys as "pretty boy". i've never scrutinized men that closely, but i don't think this guy is too good looking. he looks sick. his face is way too thin, and his sunken eyes make it look like he's going to pass out at any moment. i'd never heard of him before, but i think he should give up acting and go back to his day job. jake busey plays the local drug runner wild bill. busey is not a terrible actor. he was good in starship troopers, and even made a menacing villain in hitcher 2. but here, he just chews the scenery in standard bad guy mode. even his "threating" dialog is yawn worthy. we're supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket. but why? what does he do? because he wants to buy a bar from patton "by any means necessary"? ellen hollman has the token girlfriend role. a woman with a secret. too bad that secret is about as difficult to figure out as 2+2. she's the local elementary school teacher who happens to be a former army soldier. guess what that means? it means that while she may quiver with fear for the majority of the movie, she'll be ready to smash heads when the fur starts to fly. oh well, at least she's hot. actually the fight between her and wild bill's girl is the best one in the movie. it's fast, brutal, and entertaining. which leads me to my next problem with the movie...the fights. as i said schaech knows how to throw a punch. the same can't be said for anyone he faces in the movie. obviously the movie will all come down to schaech versus busey. busey is an actor, not a fighter. he doesn't possess the skills to pull of a movie fight. swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well choreographed fights. he also faced a couple of worthy opponents, and had one killer (literally) move. none of that here. with a couple of exceptions, the fights are forced, poorly staged, and routine. the punches sound like someone smacking a 2x4 on the concrete, and there's even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match up to the punch. it's embarrassing. there isn't even the good southern/redneck music of the original. road house had the jeff healy band, who were a somewhat popular band at the time. this movie features a singer called john otto, whose music is tepid, and his acting even worse. he's given one line in the movie, which was probably inserted to appease whatever fans he may have out there. either that, or someone owed him a favor. my final complaint about the movie is one that comes out of just being picky...the continuity. movies are shot out of sequence, and then it's the editor's job to piece it all together. well someone should give the editor of this movie a little shove. the problems range from little things like people not looking the same direction when a shot changes, to re-used footage at the end of the movie. in the beginning, we are introduced to the bar, the black pellican. as the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, the bouncers, and the people dancing. at the end of the movie, when the bad guys have been defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, with insert shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl. the problem is, the footage of the people in the bar is the same footage from the beginning of the movie!!! i kid you not. it's the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. want to know the funniest part? you see bouncers in the shot that were killed earlier in the movie. do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie unless you feel the need to go out and punch someone. this movie will make you angry enough to do it.

if i had never seen the first road house, then i guess this movie might get one more star, but even then that makes it a 3 star movie. for that matter i was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has.in reality, i was not able to finish this movie, as it was painful. where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still referenced. this doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. also, the acting is weak...i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act. even good actors like busey don't work out, probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing. the strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's b movie, yet is made in 06. i am not sure as to why, but then again, this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason. the music, the look, and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on cinemax late at night. the strangest thing of all is that i am also expecting ja rule to come in at some point...often it reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors.the most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the lois lane character on smallville which is also quite annoying. and lets not forget the fakest sounding "southern accents" i have heard since walk the line. i realize this is common place in movies, but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal hick place on tv where anyone from any southern state (or ky and wv) sound exactly the same. sure, people in desert towns in az sound just like people in southeastern states 2000+ miles away. that was wearing thin 10 years ago in the b movies where technique came from. why do writers / directors make such decisions? bottom line: i would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of road house or if you like good movies. also, if you have not seen it yet, don't spoil it by seeing this version first. the original road house was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over. it was an unexpected success like american graffiti, dazed and confused, and more recently office space, fast and furious (only the first one!), and napolean dynamite. why did they spoil it!!!???they should have never made a sequel to road house other than a high budget version with the right actors / director. sure, you can never top the original (ex: bad news bears, the longest yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right it will be presentable as is the case with the examples i mentioned. but to make a low budget, off-network, self production of road house is criminal.

the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie, which although it didn't have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting, was a very enjoyable and popular film, largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast, along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy.16 years later, and mgm / sony attempts to re-create the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing... with a movie which quotes all the original's best one liners and recites the three rules.were this an amateur fan made film, it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayze's movies. as a professionally made film, it falls flat on it's face right into the dvd bargin bin, with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original.having said that, with new lines such as "i'm gonna kill you just like i killed your father" no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script.i knew this was never going to be anything special, being a straight to dvd sequel, but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name, but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film, with a little narcotics added in.were i the director, i'd have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and it's characters. as it is, we got patrick swayze's character now supposed to be dead (killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey) and his brother and son now the main characters, who strangely enough have completely different surnames.my favourite part was that dalton's 'son' drove the same car his father did, a genuinely cool homage, although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did. that's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the '89 movie.also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane "just like i killed your father" and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner. amazing writing there. i see schaech is listed as co-screenwriter. stick to acting, or preferably, nothing.overall though, this is an ok film if there's nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half, or if you haven't seen the first road house, but hardcore fans of swayze's classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first. as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film, "even jeff healy is glad he won't be seeing this one!" stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days!

let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover. with that said, anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional. the film "is what it is." and what is that... a modest budget ($4 million, i estimate) studio sequel. the film isn't terrible, but for road house fans it will be a disappointment. and that brings me to problem one, just as dirty dancing wouldn't been what it was without swayze, road house isn't the same without him. the lead lacks depth, character, and likability to carry the film. i feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel. the other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like will patton along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag. busey, who i have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in. ellen was played well, except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick. sherri, the dea agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. the writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. instead opting for a base one dimensional film. which leads me to the biggest problem, the script... i got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an "and" and an "&." it looked very amateur. and that is what the writing was. i heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began. some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are... during the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. "hey lets meet at a crowded nudey bar, i will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table" wait! "make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!" second, i love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later. there are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron. which brings me to the realism of the dea training, i won't both to get technical... but jumping thru doors isn't standard training... nor do typical female agents, who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field, act like weak characters... boring! thanks for the chauvinistic view heir director. there is other stuff i could teach a course at a school about it... the sped up fighting, the cheezy dialogue, the recycled story... etc... but aside from all that you just cannot like ex-mr. applegate, he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made mr. patrick swayze such a bad ass. he just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass, but just like van damnit he runs into a real bad ass (chuck zito in van don't case) and he gives him a lesson about "badassdom." therefore, that i feel is the major linchpin of the film, if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass, you don't have to try. example: swayze! if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things... then well... you are why your audience, the average joe... will not rent this film, and if they do they will write reviews like this.

this television show, is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learnabout animals watch the discovery channel. if you want to watchnincompoops on television just watch mtv. mtv stands for music televisionnot nitwit d-listers preforming retarded skits or bratty kids cryingtheir hearts out for not getting a bmw for there 16th birthday. i betthat if you like this show i bet you love viva la bam, and jackass huh? i think my iq dropped ten points watching this show. this is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planetsome people think this is a good combination.i on the other hand think it is retardant.and if you notice its a lot like jackassand viva la bamjust a note, this show is horrible

spoilers!!i hate this one, but it is better than the others after this, they just keep getting worse. i hope gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one. a lot of the same with humor, ie the toilet, kids, etc. how much farther can we watch their relationship evolve. drugs, bad guys why south africa! i found that unbelievable, maybe south american, some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better. it seems the late 80' early 90's had the blond bad guys ie die hard, the mighty ducks play ice land gary busey in the last weapon, etc. hollywood repeats itself over. this one with a similar story has to go over the top. the attacking the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and way over the top gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much. like many part 2's, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill. 3/10

riggs and murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. the story line is just awful! i mean really, south african diplomats smuggling the mythical krugerrands into the u.s. it's just painful! and the accents are absolutely abysmal! can no one get an afrikaans south african accent right? or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken hollanders? the only guy who got the afrikaans accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire. another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so artlessly describes an afrikaans accent as being shitty! i mean what a slap in the face to the afrikaans. there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. i mean mel gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their p.a. type! don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. if you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2.

richard donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of south africa.it's not as if america is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of rodney king and glorifies the police department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour. so donner's salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late = developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white south africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? inside rudd's (joss ackland - eminently hissable) office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point,he and his men are referred to as "nazis" at regular intervals. for me the only bright spot in the movie was when mel gibson turned up at an anti - apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription "end aparthied now". the intensely irritating joe pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly-trained puppy.this would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat,but sadly he survives to irritate another day. miss patsy kensit seems in a world of her own,perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite mel gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere.shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into mel's caravan to keep the u.s. army in iraq going for six months. fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack.i hope he got a special bone as a reward. the film climaxes(without interruption from mel's dog) on a cargo ship bound for nazi germany (sorry,south africa),when mel and danny murder so many members of the master race that i lost count.despite jiggling around like bonnie and clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets,mel survives,curled up in his partner's arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father.take that,apartheid!

the only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in ny during '81. as for the film itself it has at least three major flaws. first of all, there is narration throughout the film, which is not required at all. in the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way. secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio, in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film. the third flaw was in the ending. i will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting. not worth the money or time it takes to see this, unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands.

john sayles, what have you done?"silver city" had moments in which i could see the glimmering hope of a good story, well-drawn characters, thought provoking dialog. and then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing, clumsy direction, and abysmal acting. i truly love almost all of john sayles' work, but "silver city" is ghastly.i got the feeling that sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines, but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the bush administration onto it. the two stories don't really connect with each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the movie, causing me to lose patience with the whole affair.the other major flaw is danny huston's acting. his dialog in every scene is delivered with a gawping grin, regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. i hated this guy by the end of the film, having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play i've ever seen. not having seen huston in anything else, i don't know whether to blame him or to blame sayles' direction of him more. regardless, he's the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie.right down to the last sledgehammer-subtle final scene i was disappointed by "silver city." sayles at his best, or heck, even sayles at mediocre, can be so very much better than this film. see any of his other works instead. this isn't even worth a rental.

when my parents rented this movie, i was expecting a very funny movie as randy quaid is very funny in comedy movies. however, this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too. you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long. so i can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list. it may work for some people, but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build-up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie. randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses. the premise of the movie had potential, as did the casting of quaid, but all of it just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary. granted, the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a whirlpool of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror, instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre.

very disturbing, but expertly crafted & scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail. mary beth hurt, sandy dennis, and especially randy quaid are unusually good. the story centers around a young boy (bryan madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from. his parents (hurt, quaid) strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist (dennis) to get involved. it is a gruesome cannibal movie. but it's not bad. if you like hannibal, you'll love this. if you don't like parents, stay away from the film. just giving advice to cannibal lover and haters.rated r for strong adult themes and graphic violence.

i watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night. i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved. though i felt that the directing was done well, the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home. you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them, it's just a little too slow. this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better. the only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that i downed during the course of the flick. bring on the slasher films folks, because at least i know what to expect out of them. this was not my thing, too much dark humour, and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been, and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens.in conclusion i give this horror/comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10.

with a cast of mostly lesser-tiered stars (alain delon, robert wagner, eddie albert), lousy special effects (sure, it was the 70's but "alien" and "star wars" came from the same decade), and a storyline that is so laughable that one might want to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been grounded.even academy award winners cicely tyson and george kennedy can't keep this "bird" airborne.the implausibility of the third film - airplane is submerged in the bermuda triangle - is much more believable than this turkey.avoid "the concorde" at all costs!

the concorde:airport'79, is for now, the last of the high drama high,camp airport series, at first glance in the tv guide,or dvd cover you would simply think that the film your about to view is as thrilling as the previous airport's think again! what your treated to is 2 hours and 3 minutes worth of unintentional laughs courtesy of the worst script ever writing it was even penned by eric roth, who brought the world 'forrest gump! well one things for sure the script is not oscar worthy,it's razzie worthy! the executives at universal in '79,done the right thing by marketing this as a 'comedy' apart from charo! the film does have an impressive cast list, it's certainly watchable to say the least,

i haven't had a chance to view the previous film, but from what i've read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one, although i doubt that is possible. i'm a huge fan of the "zombie" genre, and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures, that for all intents and purposes are human, as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head. that said, hotd 2 takes the "zombie" movie to an all new low.without giving any big spoilers (which i really should do just so you won't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie) i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces. gomer pile could have probably survived longer than the "spec ops" soldiers in this film. for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead. if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies, at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses. i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement.the writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for, and the idea has merit, if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making. i mean come on, zombie films aren't exactly "high art", and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills, but hotd 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters. if you are a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.

its almost embarrassing to say i even saw this movie. i mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. does house of the dead 2 do any of these things right? no, not one. of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from uwe bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.the dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as "what do you do for a living?" in response "i kill zombies" and "i was never a disk jockey, i was a soldier." the special effects are embarrassing even for a made for tv movie, i mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. the army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. this movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms. in fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.also, why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models? and for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them. heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie.overall, this movie makes even the worst of scifi channel movies looks fantastic.

this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all time.it is worth the rental for a some wildly great laugh's.the story is absolutely ludicrous.nothing in life would happen like this.it's so completely unbelievable. the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters, than they give this supposed two-bit hustler a job 3000 miles away in la what a jokei love the old beat vw bug to signify how low they've gotten in life because of all the `tootski's'.sean young is as unbelievably bad as the, "i'll love you forever, no matter what, wife" you'll ever see.if it wasn't so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herself.and as bad acting as you'll ever see.james wood overacts throughout the whole movie and he's so extremely funny and is way, way over the top, it's just not to be believed, woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night live.but watching woods on `ludes' is worth the price of the rental.i love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more `ludes' that he doesn't do that stuff anymore, right before that, woods just did three giant lines of coke.this is some very funny stuff.the ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie.

i saw this film in the theater when it first came out, i'm sorry to say, and it was one of only a few films i have ever wanted to walk out of early. i didn't have a problem with the drug content and i could see how this cautionary tale could have been powerful. the problem was, the film-maker, working with james woods and sean young, drew two of the least lovable characters i have ever seen on film. i hated this pair and couldn't have cared less if they sunk straight to the inevitable bottom. their was not one surprise in this film. every turn of events was so painfully obvious that i felt i could have written the script myself; although i like to think i would have done a better job. i subsequently heard nightmarish stories about the incidents on the set between sean young and james woods along the lines of some sort of stalking events. it made me wonder if the terrible acting arose out of some bad feelings and dysfunction. anyway, i refer to the boost as the worst film i've ever paid money to see.

my gosh, this movie was nothing more than filmmaking by numbers. struggling salesman can't make a go of it in new york, mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, struggling salesman moves to california and makes it big, then loses it big, then bounces back with the simple life, then hits rock bottom trying to get back to the top. i don't think i can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. case in point (spoiler?): when the john kapelos character calls to say he and his girlfriend were coming to santa cruz to visit, and james woods says there's practically no chance he would come, you knew with 100% certainty they were coming in the next scene or two.on the other hand, sean young sure looked good.

salesman lenny brown (woods) is fast losing his knack of selling the proverbial ice cream to eskimos. given a chance to shine in california by a philanthropic entrepreneur, brown and his wife linda (young) live the high life off tax shelter investments; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws.seven hundred thousand dollars in the red, and in need of a 'boost', the yuppies without portfolio begin to hoover vast quantities of colombian marching powder up their hooters, until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on their back. after briefly cleaning up, linda's coke-induced miscarriage sees lenny once more careering like a pinball between uppers and downers. living purgatory follows.a contemporary take on reefer madness, with perverse echoes of albert brooks' lost in america, the boost was overshadowed on release by tabloid revelations concerning an alleged affair between woods and young, and their tumultuous falling out. woods, then engaged to horse trainer sarah owen (now his ex-wife), reputedly slapped a $2 million lawsuit on his spurned co-star for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing fatal attraction-style late-night phone calls to his fiancée and, in one noteworthy incident, reputedly leaving a mutilated baby doll on his and owen's doorstep.ironically, the lack of chemistry between the supposedly loving leads is one of the more depressing aspects of this latter-day exploitation flick - the only real passion woods demonstrates towards young is when he's kicking her around the room. the script too is hilariously dreadful, perhaps mitigating young's near-comatose performance when given howlers like "stay with me - 'til i fall off the earth" to emote. further, given woods' edgy dramatic personae, his jittery descent loses all credibility when actually he looked that way to begin with.ultimately, the boost must be seen in context: in the 21st century cocaine use is ubiquitous. however, in 1988, with america still embroiled in an unwinnable "war on drugs", the very fibre of the nation looked to be in peril - hence one of the most hellish - and for that read hysterical - depictions of drug-abuse.

it is impossible to avoid comparing zhang yimou's `hero' to ang lee's `crouching tiger, hidden dragon.' they were both big-budget chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars. but aside from the obvious, there is in fact nothing else to compare. `hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenery, and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.all the marketing hype preceding the premier of `hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one. much anticipated, `hero' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland china and hong kong, making it an instant box-office success. however, though the script pleased government censors, chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. on-line critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing,' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude,' written `either by an amateur historian, or someone with ulterior motives.' one article was simply titled, `hero, you make me sick!'the deepest failing of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring! all blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but `hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as stalin or hitler. `hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun. instead, it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.though historians agree that the first emperor of china was ruthlessly violent, mao zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given mao's own tyrannical rule. likewise, the communist government in beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and its own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by zhang yimou. tony leung, one of the stars of `hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was needed to maintain `stability' in china. for these remarks, tony leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of hong kong, but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.director zhang yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. unfortunately, his version of `wisdom' turns out to be: the oppressor is right. in china, where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. the great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills. only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in china, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, zhang yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth, as he had hoped, but downwards, to the level of government propaganda. it's no wonder the government was so pleased.some film lovers may secretly wonder, `all moralistic judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?' fortunately, the answer is a resounding `no!' because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to watch. moreover, the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real' version emerges.the film is not without its beautiful images. however, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. the use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived, and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.for those in china who showed disdain for `crouching tiger's' unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from `hero.' jet li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor. his previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that zhang yimou could use li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities. but it was not to be. `hero' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and jet li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting: an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. as the casting director ought to have expected, li fails miserably. meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film, between li and and donnie yen. all the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `hero' fails to satisfy, even on that level.though most audiences outside china are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel first emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept zhang's version of `chinese wisdom,' which is anything but. perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `hero' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for chinese government officials.

impressive vision indeed, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic chinese violins too... let me think, "crouching tiger, hidden dragon"?i kinda liked cthd, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters, that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the deeepaa meaning of it."hero" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. the larger-than-life moral was horrible. i mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed???? wtf??no, thanks.but, hay, mao and g.w.b. would be proud!viva

the message of hero is quite clear: the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan, it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. roger ebert of chicago tribune, david edelstein of slate, charles taylor of salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero. in so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. the only critic (that i know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was j. hoberman of the village voice, who wrote of the film's "sanctimonious traditionalism" and its "glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness." i, for one, sign my name under hoberman's final pronouncement: hero is nothing more than "fascinating fascism."

as a native chinese, i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. i said 'better world' because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! i guess most western audience may don't know qin shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china. the tianxia(chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. from then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.another fact is, qin shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.well, i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.

because they all just watch there mst3k with their artificial friends who make (mostly) not that funny and obvious comments about movies. and that's the only way these people watch them and then they comment and down-vote them on the imdb based just on that, they don't even try to watch the film on it's own.i watched this film on it's own, i didn't read the reviews first, i didn't have some people telling what to laugh at, i just got the dvd (bought for the flip side morons from outer space, an old fave) and watched it.of cause i knew kind of what i was in for when it's a golan globus, albert pyun film, but usually they can be quite entertaining.the film is a non too stressing on the brain alice down the rabbit-hole story done so many times, and kind of similar in basic structure (but completely different in content) to warlords of atlantis, another entertaining b-movie.the voice, was annoying, but then that's the idea, which they even poke at with a few lines in the movie.the hero character had one of the worst over-the top voices/accents in english language film history, but you grow to accept it and enjoy it.it's not a good film, but it's not a really bad film, it's just a bit of an average b-movie dtv kind of film, nothing too new nothing too outstanding, and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age bracket (say 7-14 year olds) than i. it's a bit of light-hearted fantasy.will i see it again, probably not maybe about 10 years ago i would have.don't be so harsh on a movie because a couple of puppets told you too, this film isn't taking itself seriously and it's certainly no troll 2 or space mutiny.

every boy eventually learns the lesson that just because a girl is good-looking, it doesn't mean she's good. well, lemme tell you, at age 19, lesson learned. it's hard to tell what's worse: kathy ireland's acting skills, or her ultra-high-pitched voice; the one that sounds like a screeching mouse on helium scratching its tiny little claws down a blackboard. with an incomprehensible plot set in outer space with dwarves that want kathy ireland's bones for some obscure reason, this movie is just wrong on so many levels. if there were ever a candidate for a mystery science theater 3000 revival, this would be it.

...don't watch it. here's a hint: tune in to the last 5 minutes and you'll catch her in a bikini. otherwise you'll just have to sit through the flick and endure her helium-sucking voice view for screen time with the inexplicable aussie accents of the lost city of atlantis or wherever the heck she goes to to locate her missing father. we now know why kathy pursued a non-speaking career of modelling: she couldn't have survived the death-threats from those poor headache-suffering victims who heard her voice for more than 30 seconds. the rest of the story is some kind of weird poorly-lit mad max mish-mash.

i watched the mst3k version of the movie, and this review includes minor spoilers.when i started watching this movie, it looked like it might have promise as a cheesy sci-fi flick, but the more i watched it, the more disappointing it got. the first reason is pretty idiosyncratic - i liked the mousy shy girl with glasses a lot more than the model wanda became by the end of the movie. more deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and change in clothing replaced any actual character growth. instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself, wanda was just as dependent on males to do everything for her as she was at the start of the movie. the acting could have been better (though i got tired of cracks about ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself! it's not that bad.) the background was okay, but it was a little hokey (aliens = humans with facepaint), and could have used more explanation.maybe it was just that i was interested in the movie itself, but joel and the bots did little for me. the movie might have been better without them at all.overall (for the movie itself, not the mst3k), a 3 out of 10. it was an okay flick, for what it was.

boy, this movie is bad. and not in a good, cheesy, fun way, either. even mst3k couldn't stop it from being boring, and it's also confusing as all get out. but the most annoying part of this dull mess is ireland's hideous high pitched voice, which i was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. not to mention how really unappealing her character is. even her dad ran away and abandoned her! i can see why, frankly. if he'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he'd have been tempted to do her a great harm. as i was, by the end of the movie. plus, she's useless and annoying. when she falls down the long hole in the earth a la alice in wonderland, she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably australian accented miner hadn't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. he should have just tied her to the atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it. and this atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density,i have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? did they have generators that imitate the sun? no matter. there's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly costumed goth wannabees running around trying to catch kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). stupid, pointless film. thank you golan globus, for this cinematic abomination. may you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.

look no further, this is it, the worst movie ever made. there may be others that are tied, but there are none worse. there can't be.i found this movie on a clearance-sale laserdisc for $3.25, and thought no movie with those actors could possibly not be worth that price. turns out it's worth triple that - as the minimum they should have paid me to watch it.i'm virtually certain that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie, they substituted someone else, someone younger and cuter, to make it look more appealing. whatever "plot" there was amounted to about three minutes of actual movie, the rest is filler. and i don't mean the kind of filler that you only realize is filler when it's over, or that is some kind of eye candy you don't mind having there, i mean filler that has you thinking about your shopping list. i think the "music" must have been made up by somebody with a friend who had a radio he listened to once. it's terrible.if there were a shot of a nice mountain, a river valley, a forest, anything, there would be something positive about this movie. there isn't. even with the speeder button on the remote, even at top laserdisc speed, you can't get it over with fast enough.after years of thinking about commenting on movies, being tempted but not registering with imdb, i finally cracked, because i had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as far as possible.the guidelines ask that you "focus on the content and context". i can't. there isn't enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. sometimes bad is just bad, and this movie would have to be much better than it is to aspire to being only that.

i couldn't wait for the end. this is absolutely the worst film i have ever seen. if you thought that just about anyone could make a watchable movie, these folks prove that there is a minimum skill set required. this is a film with no redeeming features whatsoever. it scores a zero in every department. this is more than just 'amateur' as the audience is given no consideration or regard at all. there is no serious attempt to act or entertain. the storyline is aimless, pointless and senseless. the cast look very uncomfortable and completely lack direction. the technical aspects of the film are poor.as a dvd it makes a good drinks coaster.

a friend of mine once rented this, thinking since peter fonda starred in it, it couldn't be bad. wrong! it's bad as anything can be. there is so much to laugh at and it's not the jokes. for instance, in one scene hawken walks into the forest and when he comes out he is suddenly wearing a completely different outfit! where was "the director's" brain when he shot that scene?!? probably the same place fonda's was when he agreed to do this flick. it's truly a shame one has to see such a fine actor go dumb in this poor excuse for a film.nobody's performance in this movie can be called acting. jack elam is brought in just to bring up the star count here, but all he does is looking startled in a very dark and awfully shot scene in some kind of bar. not to mention the "indians", the girl was so godawful i wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine as well. if i could give this a 0, i would. shame that mark doesn't exist here. this truly reminds of a bad joke or an amateur footage made just for fun. this should serve as a proof of how bad b-movies can get.

i hate a movie that doesn't have an ending. i don't care how good or bad the rest might be, i don't like to be left without a conclusion. such shows should insist upon a disclaimer ... something like: the movie you are about to watch has either no ending or is so ambiguous as to not be conclusive.in the movie the last scene we are left with is dee and dominic having a bit of a row and he says, almost regretfully i thought, that it couldn't be him because the fingers were either that of a girl or a child. then it ends! well sure, the smoking gun, so to say, is in the hands of the dee's son, but what about dominic's daughter? i actually thought we might discover it was her! anyway, unless you like inconclusive movies, then i'd avoid this one. otherwise, i thought the movie generally good.

before you dismiss my post as "not getting it", let me say...i'm one of the biggest richard kelly and "the twilight zone" fans out there. donnie darko is one my all-time favorites and i even thought southland tales had it's moments. i'm a huge sci-fi fan. i was very excited to see "the box", couldn't wait for it to come out.having said that..."the box" is terrible. behind "drag me to hell", this was the worst movie i've seen in 2009. and it just simply will not end! whenever you think you've reached the end, another change in the plot and you're off to more torture. i was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film...i could hardly take it anymore.the biggest problem with "the box", no matter how you slice it or try to justify it, is that it simply makes little sense. trust me, i "got it", i understood what was going on. but that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it. take the basics for example. the main couple...cameron diaz and james marsden, playing norma and arthur lewis. diaz loses her finances at her job, then bemoans to her husband that they are "living paycheck to paycheck". well, sell that f-ing porsche your husband is driving then!!! they live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision. marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at nasa and diaz is an accomplished teacher. and, yes, marsden drives an overly expensive car. but they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? no need to press the button, just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! the movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. instead, they are seemingly desperate for money...all the while living what i would call a luxurious lifestyle. like i said...you can understand what's going on, yet it still makes little sense! that's a rare combination.there was an awful scene in a library that i feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly acted too by the way). it was idiotic, illogical and out of place. i can't even begin to fully describe it actually, so i will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens. (yes, i'm being serious unfortunately). a kid is in diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school). he starts asking diaz personal questions, literally embarrassing her in front of her class. no punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! then diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt, apron and all! i don't know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in junior high) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! (see what i mean...you can understand it completely, but it still makes no sense...a rare combo!) like many things in the movie, the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him, no ending to his character. moving on... a lady then approaches diaz in a grocery store, telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving diaz advice?! again...the lady was trying to help diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! never explained. never talked about again. no nothing!! it goes on and on and on like this for, what seemed to me like, 2 weeks. it would not end! i wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point. it was poorly edited. diaz's accent was there one minute, gone the next. sub-plots began but never ended. the numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. it's truly a train-wreck.pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10, just because i like diaz and sci-fi! but it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.thanks for reading! jd

ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. where does one start? a lot of the good stuff has already been said - so i won't divulge into the same territory. i believe you already have the movie summary - so i won't paraphrase the movie.first - let's start the with good.1). if you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as i do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live, another to die, or, what if you had to die by drowning or fire) this movie is a great concept - bottom line.2) the wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. realistically though, how difficult is that to accomplish? .....okay, that's about all for the good. let's talk about the bad.1). this movie feels like a 2 hour "twilight zone" episode. this could easily be 90 minutes. that might have made the movie tolerable.2). do you remember in the movie "from dusk til dawn?". the movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? yep - same thing here. i would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. i've gotten deeper thought provocation out of transformers 2.3). yes - we get the dilemma in the film. we understand the philosophical undertones and utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, didn't elaborate on the current story arc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.4). the ending didn't make sense. not at all. none.this movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. if you're board out of your mind, in bed sick, or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and can view this free on-line - by all means, go for it.if you need to pay anything to view this movie, don't waste your time - you're better off watching old howie mandel stand-up on you tube. you will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer.

be warned, the next time you see "richard kelly" involved in any production, run away. fast.kelly proved to the world after his last movie, "southland tales", that he is one pretentious director. it was indulgent and convoluted. in "the box", not much has changed.i can picture what his pitch to warner bros must have been, and i bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of richard "twilight zone" matheson's old short stories.big mistake! do not read any further unless you want this movie completely spoiled for you: norma (cameron diaz) pushes the button. turns out that arlington steward (frank langella) has an alien using his body as a vessel to conduct "experiments" in which the fate of mankind rests. his face is scarred because he was struck by alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. obviously since norma pushes the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. in the end she and her husband (james marsden) choose to kill norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.kelly dances around his film's "message", trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is. obviously, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, "what if i was the person who dies?". richard kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal, human conversation. in fact, they avoid it all together. they appear to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for nasa, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to look outside of the box???if he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the entire movie could have ended right there! instead, we have to watch weddings go on forever, nasa and the nsa be complacent to arlington stewart taking over these government programs, teleportation to show marsden life beyond our world so it will be "easier" to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.the most painful part of this movie is the pacing. nothing really happens. its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable.it is insufferable how this film is being marketed. the commercials make it look like "saw" and even use the music from those films to sell it. in reality what you get is a slow, dull, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects), and messy film which is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. at one point, cameron diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the nsa's big black car with her husband on the way home. where did she go? why did they take her? do we really care? not anymore you won't.by the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. you will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. go see anything else that's playing. don't waste your time, or money.

supreme sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the u.s. government. she has to kill a known tv reporter, but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter. because she hasn't killed him, she becomes the next target of her employers.the script isn't good although i've seen worse b-movies. a hit-man with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror,... what's next? aliens rescuing the victim??? no, supreme sanction will never win any award because of the script. and the acting isn't any better i'm afraid. a few better known actors (michael madsen and kristy swanson), who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie, together with some other actors who probably don't even know what a camera really looks like don't do any good to the movie either.so why should you watch this movie? well, if you haven't got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10,531st rerun of mc gyver or the a-team, than this might be the movie you want to see. otherwise you better leave it alone. i give it a 3/10.

i bought this rental return for $1.99 at hollywood and overpaid. i didn't expect much, but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least. i quickly noted the very weak storyline, the gross overacting by everyone (no one talks like that except in cartoons), and the seemingly let's-make-it-up-as-we-go-along direction. i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it, and i feel certain that it did not help any careers. as for this movie buff of 35 years, it has now provided a ready answer for the worst-film-you've-ever-seen question.

geesh, i never, ever, ever thought i'd write the above four words. but, actually, she's the highpoint of this little flick.as the movie was packaged when i rented it, it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication, which keeps her stable. it sounded like a cute concept. for years, all we ever saw of spelling was as donna martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull, lifeless tv movies. it sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her tv success and her rich daddy, she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie, i figured she took the part because this must be a low-budget jewel.wrong.instead, spelling's part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. when she's not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly, i could've sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. this would've worked so much better if spelling's storyline had dominated, and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and phil, the least irritating kidnapper.

this was my very first "bollywood" movie and i found it in the same way many other recent viewers did -- through "ghost world". having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of bollywood this week, i understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film. but "something for everyone" doesn't always add up to a cohesive product.the ultra-groovy musical dance number "jaan pehechaan ho" has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965. it's all over the internet now, with many folks scrambling for a good english translation. laxmi chhaya does an amazing job dancing take after take, making it all look fresh, new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted! she rules! on the beach with miss kitty is a light-weight fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot. still, i find myself singing it in hindi a week later. i found a rough translation:if you want to live in this life then listen to what i say leave your sorrows behind and join the party take my advicethose who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know? come to me and i'll explainwhoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and theremy second favorite number in the film is the butler's dream where mehmood is entranced by miss kitty's dancing. the electric tiki-like idols are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number. online, i'd seen it described as what would happen if "liberace threw up"!! way fun.gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole. that's why i gave it a rating of 3. it's actually a real stinker of a film with some fun, kitschy musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot.

i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to, lightly. the film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster. the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. no - the film is just terrible. as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. avoid.

produced by international playhouse pictures, it looks as if filmed in a doll house. everybody's a liar, everything is dream-like, toy-like for no good reason. i'm not saying everything in all movies should be totally realistic, but such unbelievable fantasy things and situations in one movie are way too much. how did they get these fine actors -actresses particularly- to this movie? it's nice to see mia again; if we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her, mia does do it well. not funny, not moving, just fake. stephen dorff briefly appears at the end, fitting for a play maybe, less for a movie, but this isn't one to measure things at. terrible.

i recently was in a stage version of this play. and, on the last day of the run, i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv. i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night, and i watched it the next day. i have to say i was very disappointed. the actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script. that is understandable as the resersal process is probably different, but it was upsetting to see. a lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen, but i am not sure if it helped the movie out at all. i gave this 4 stars only because i know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays.

depressing black black comedy about a woman (mia farrow) who flees her house on christmas eve when she discovers her husband (tony goldwyn) has hired a hit man to kill her. she ends up with a husband and wife (scott glenn and mary-louise parker) and then things go wrong. basically farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting very strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations.this was advertised as a feel good movie when i saw it around christmas time at its very short run in an art cinema. i found it sick, unfunny and just depressing. i like black humor but this was way too dark for me. what happens to parker's character especially was horrifying. to make matters worse eileen brennan is thrown in as a nun (!!!) later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto.the only saving grace was farrow's acting--it's much better than this picture deserves. also it was a relief to see the very talented stephen dorff pop up at the end. the ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn't erase what had gone on before.sick, morbid, pitch black "comedy". a 1

there isn't much about "reckless" that feels right, beginning with the off-putting title (thanks to screenwriter craig lucas, who adapted his own play, bringing the title along with him) and continuing with the casting (mia farrow playing wife to tony goldwyn, who's young enough to be her son). the couple live in an idyllic winter world that appears to be the inside of a snow-globe, but farrow gets a startling dose of reality after he admits he's hired a man to kill her. she flees into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who want to help her rebuild her life. the production design and art direction of "reckless" are fine, but they are services rendered for a completely inane, often alienating screenplay. it's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy, though the cast is at a loss with this unfunny, occasionally offensive material. *1/2 from ****

oh my god, i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie, seeing as 1903 was one of my fave years for movies ever, but it sucked! the "plot", although i'd hesitate to call it that, is about some dumb elephant. it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death. lame. even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. edison is, like, the worst director ever. plus, the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever. and the ending? wow, that wasn't predictable at all. *sarcasm*the picture quality is horrible too. you can barely tell what's going on most of the time. the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other un-scary horror flicks this didn't spawn eleven sequels. other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you'll never get back.

thomas edison had no other reason to make this film except to show that film can capture the electrocution of an innocent elephant. edison was not a genius but a man out for money and profit; his love for life was measured by dollars, not experiences, as this film shows.

thomas edison may have done lots of great inventions but wtf is this!!!! i am sorry but this movie is simply awful. the plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point & gets electrocuted. okay the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper. i thought that the early charlie chaplin films were awful. okay thomas edison may have been an inventor but why did he make this film he could have filmed a baby being fed & it would have been better. people might say i'm being harsh on the times but would you enjoy something like this from what i have said edison may have made the lightbulb but why did he make this particular movie. well i might sound like a complete a##hole but watch this on youtube then you will see this abomination. i still can't believe this film is completely awful. all in all the worst short film i have ever seen.rating: 1/10

we see thomas edison, with a glowing smile on his face, trying to electrocute a 5 ton living being. eventually he was successful, and so the first animal snuff film is born, cleverly disguised as an amazing achievement in technology. this is scientific arrogance at it's worst, folks. it ranks up there with the doctor who decapitated a monkey just to prove that he could keep its severed head alive for 22 minutes.oh yes, there's the absurd excuse that the elephant had been convicted of "murder" and sentenced to death, and that this was a fair and humane "execution". to all the people who are satisfied with this sophistry, please form a line on my right. i'm going to give you all a big collective three stooges slap across the head.go watch "the advocate" (1993), a movie based on the true story murder trial of a pig in mideval france. 500 years later, humans are still a bunch of morons i see.what's next? we arrest birds for stealing our blueberries? arrest pricker bushes for assault and battery? thomas edison, i hope you have a big fat worm crawling through your eye socket right now. oh wait, that would be trespassing, wouldn't it? lol

this vicious little film is horrendous. my low rating for it comes for two main reasons. the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach. filmed over a hundred years ago, i can only hope that we've evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. this film is complete and utter exploitation, made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. historical interest aside, this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination.reason number two? look at the way that the camera is set up. it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect: long march forward of the elephant, perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses. sickening.thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren't in doubt. nobody is perfect, but when you realize that this film provided a) an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and b) he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of dc as opposed to ac, you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too dispassionate and cold. any number of peter cushing's mad scientists would be proud. the rest of us should be ashamed and revolted.

"the wizard of menlo park" was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the motion picture camera, the electric car battery, the electric power grid (possibly his most important but least recalled invention), the pre-fabricated house, and innovations to the telephone and telegraph, as well as the ticker-tape machine and an early voting machine. the total number of patents is over 1,000 - far more than any other american inventor.but edison was a ruthless business competitor. he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals. the best example is the telephone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell. actually edison's invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876, but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop. still it was part of the huge 1888 supreme court decision that was the longest u.s. supreme court decision (a single volume of their reports!) written by chief justice morrison waite - which, by the way, killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing it.in 1886 edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities. this was george westinghouse, inventor of the railroad air break. westinghouse's firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor, and former edison assistant, nicola tesla. tesla developed "alternating current", which was a rival system to edison's "direct current". edison's system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity. tesla's system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another - actually it was a better, and more efficient system. but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign.it started with electric power lines. edison early on had his lines put underground, so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions. but westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open - like telephone lines. when there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on westinghouse's lines (in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattan's business district), edison started insisting that a.c. current was far more dangerous that d.c.one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting westinghouse a.c. generators and dynamos for an electric chair. edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair, but he helped several lesser figures along the way - for the complete story read mark essig's edison & the electric chair (new york: walker & company, 2003). edison experiment himself with cats and dogs (experiments he was glad to show the public). in the long run, despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution, edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current. but he never stopped trying.in 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against westinghouse and a.c. with his invention of the motion picture camera. he assisted in "putting down" a well known public elephant ("topsy") who had killed several men. he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with a.c. but the entire killing is on film - and one can view it to this day. it is a pitiful looking film - whatever poor "topsy" had done it was a poor beast - not a machiavellian murderer. the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant, we are aware it will soon be over, but the sudden collapse of "topsy" is still an unpleasant sight to view. the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences. yet, sad to say, it probably made a profit for edison - his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here. in 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it. one is glad that more people are appalled by it today - sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit.

in 1976 a mother named norma lewis (cameron diaz) lives with her son walter and her husband arthur (james marsden). one night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. by the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents norma with an offer. this man is arlington steward (frank langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. if they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. norma and arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. the incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. arthur, who is currently working for nasa, fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut.one's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story "button button" by richard matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. the opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. richard kelly's previous film donnie darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. without the dream-like state of that far superior film, the box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. that norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as two-face from the dark knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived.if this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other godly being influencing these situations. scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the lewis family, become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. to a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. in one scene norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. he taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that norma and arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.what is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. the ending, which won't be spoilt here, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a greek tragedy. while the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. cameron diaz's southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make dr. evil proud. it really is just a shadow of his towering performance in frost/nixon. there is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both norma and arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for kelly's pastiche of ideas. underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where norma sympathises with arlington over their deformities and also when norma and arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them, highlights this.since 2001, richard kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of donnie darko. though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. the box is one film this year that should have been shelved.

surely this deserves to be in the bottom 10 films of all time, pity it's just a tv movie. rubbish that only we british can produce! it perhaps has some merit in the so awful it's good scale. watch out for scene where they start dancing !

this movie is such a total waste of time. i can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash. oh, i would have loved it when i was seven years old. i think a seven year old child may have written and directed it.there's no script, no acting, just rubbish. the best acting is that by the fighting roosters. i think i could whip these ninjas and i am not someone you'd consider tough. totally unconvincing and did not spark the least bit of interest. i was yawning, and laughing, by the end of the first ten minutes of the film. this is one that would turn people away from martial art movies. great comedy, bad action flick.

this movie is recommended only for insomniacs: it will relieve them by putting them to sleep. five-year-olds might also enjoy it. but for anyone else (including fans of the genre), what a bore! the "ancient" plot is reminiscent of "return of the dragon", and this film is just as inept, but nero is no bruce lee, so "enter the ninja" is an even worse film. until now, this is the second (the offensive "comedy" "bachelor party" was the first) film i gave 1/10 to.

i stumbled across this movie late at night on tv. my brother and i could not stop laughing at how god awful this movie is. the crappy sound effects whenever white ninja or black ninja punch, kick, or use a weapon is hilarious. this movie is almost on the same level as the evil dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because of shear crappiness. i'm not sure if the director meant for it to be so crappy on purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it.

franco nero stars as cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy frank landers (alex courtney) and his fetching wife (susan george) to protect them from a mobster (christopher george) who wants the land. things get even more complicated when the mobster hires cole's old nemesis (sho kosugi) who is also a ninja. inept martial arts actioner, while having better production values then most ninja movies, fails to inject any life into the surroundings, or for that matter actionscenes. a poor effort all around.

terrible action movie in which lead franco nero exchanges his cowboy hat, gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in django (1966) for an all-white ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it! despite virtually non-stop action, the film is utterly clichéd and unintentionally funny - with a campy villain, to boot, in christopher george. susan george (no relation) is the attractive woman with a washed-up husband, nero's wartime companion, whom the villains are trying to push off her oil-rich land - but the latter haven't counted upon nero's martial-arts (and stunt-heavy) gymnastics. the solution to their problems is to hire a similarly-skilled ninja for themselves who, as it happens, turns out to be nero's deadly enemy (played by sho kosugi, who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another!). the climax takes place inside an arena where one-man army nero 'eliminates' george and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations; the subtle way in which he despatches his nemesis, however, is effectively done.

a combat veteran, fresh from completion of ninjutsu training, reunites with an old friend in manila and gets caught up in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron.but, do you really care about that? if you're even reading this page, you must know something of what to expect. it's your typical chop-socky, complete with ridiculous dialouge, mega-corny villains, apocalyptic sound editing, and a camera that begs for your attention. the only reason for being seen in public with this film is the fight sequences, wonderfully choreographed by mike stone and true master sho kosugi. franco nero ain't no slouch either, assuming you can see around the mustache.well, i'm being too harsh. there are some good laughs--enjoy christopher george repeatedly screaming "ninja!" and delivering arguably the goofiest death scene ever captured on film.

this is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome!!! it has everything an early eighties movie needs: flared pants, big moustaches, chicks with farrah hair, and most importantly, ninjas!!!! i have a few choice moments to recant for you. cole's army buddy has a strange monkey-like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. he gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film. at one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy's hired goons and frank, i think his name is frank, is so moved he shouts to the whole group "lets have a cock fight!!" and they all gleefully move to the cock fighting area of the farm to begin the festivities. this is funny on every level possible. whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart. another funny thing is sho kosugi's little grunts and over animated ninja style movements. i remember this dude from when i was a kid and he used to say he was the world's only real ninja (he had ads in martial arts magazines) if i remember correctly. my friends and i were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and i can recall seeing it in the local theater many times. i was wondering as i watched this on starz last night why every sleazy american gangster type always has a stronghold in the phillipines and wears a white steve martin suit. as a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in requiring all of his thugs to wear white steve martin suits. there is a scene where it looks like 20 steve martin impersonators are attacking a 1970's sears underwear model (cole). as we wind up for the final battle cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires off a round from his pump action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care. cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, proceeds to sneakily ascend a staircase then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are. the second in charge tells him he didn't need to kill everybody as they were expecting him, then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge cock fighting arena. don't ask me why cock fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is. when they arrive cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it. the final battle is approaching as cole has killed everybody and now sho, as i like to call him, reveals himself to have kidnapped cole's lady aka frank's wife, and they meet in the snazziest cockfighting arena you ever saw. sho then, very politely i might add, releases said lady and the battle is about to start. they do their bowing and start circling each other, both masked by the way. when they join in battle it appears cole becomes someone else intermittently ala "finishing the game" a funny spoof on completing bruce lee's "game of death". cole eventually comes out on top, kills sho, who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well. next we see cole, after ruining everyone's life is about to split town again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably winks at the camera, freeze frame, credits, done.

this is a very famous ninja movie but it isn't a nice movie. if you want to see some ninjas and some figures, want to know some things about ninjas see this movie. this movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia.first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best. you can just see ninja figures and fight in this scenes. between these are below the average, nearly bad as a movie. acting is bad. sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. frank nero is a good actor and charismatic but he cannot fight good. scenario is also not good. its so simple. franko nero comes near to his best , old friend from army and war. he also protects him from mafia but he is having sex ( go to bed ) with his wife and his friend knows this but don't say anything to nero negative. is this possible in life ? what a friendship !finally this movie started a genre ; ninja movies. also there is the ninja master sho kasugi but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo. this film is below the average even it is a classic.

any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it. otherwise i can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.the fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable. instead of casting franco nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead. in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie. nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar. his kicks and punches are lame.there's enough of old action movies with good action. this is just a waste of time.

enter the ninja (1981) was the first of several "ninja" films produced by cannon starring or co-starring japanese sensation sho kosugi. but the star of the first "ninja" film was legendary tough guy franco nero. sadly not even mr. nero or sho kosugi couldn't make this film watchable. when you have two bad dudes in an action film and it's neither watchable or fun, somethings amiss. but i digress. skip this chapter and watch the next films in the series. they're more interesting and a whole lot of fun.next is revenge of the ninja. instead of playing the "evil oriental" (i use that term tongue in cheek mind you). he's the star! strange for a western film. watch that one instead.not recommended except for die hard sho kosugi fans or cannon film buffs.

this film simply has no redeeming features. the story is incomprehensible, and the script is gross, sadistic, and stupid. the sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. the music is awful. the acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. a half star dud. shame on directv for putting it on pay-per-view. in a theater, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.

this movie has too many things going on. another reviewer comments on the disjointed, episodic nature of the film as reflecting the director's memories - that's fine, if that is how it was written and performed. instead, what we get is straight-forward narrative - some of the time - that jumps around, under and over, leaves us dangling in some instances, interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances, and otherwise simply doesn't work. there are also some plot details that just don't work. for example, why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, as opposed to night time? why leave your flat sheet on the body? why would an artist who knew the joe character for a brief time decide to leave him "everything" (even if it wasn't much)? this sub-plot was poorly developed to make that point work. for that matter, why even have the man be an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes? he could just as easily have been a photographer, or a opera composer? for that matter, how does someone rate an apartment in an opera house - particularly without some clear connection to the opera? the coincidences are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained. why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and "disappear." if tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as bangor, how could joe lose track of him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job. some of the other subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend(s) and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding. there's some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts. as completed, this movie made little sense and offers even less.

i'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy "frisk," the project that put todd verow on the map, if that is indeed where he is. i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material; verow fairly rolls around in it. judging from what he's done since then he's well-suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it. "vacationland," a would-be "teen coming out" film, is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy, and i'm disappointed i have to report that.first off, our hero, the high school senior "joe" is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 . when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joe's teacher it's confusing, as the sweaty-faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching. joe's mother looks younger than he does and doesn't "act" any older either. second, in joe's opening scenes he looked like he was either playing, or actually experiencing, mental challenges. to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was "playing young," but it just wasn't working--it was weird.it's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that, considering where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all, even as a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero...one minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex (a scene so un-erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice), the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double-crossing. this is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is "andrew," and that's about all we learn about him, other than he's apparently gay but not out yet.there's a lot crammed in to the 1:44 running time (which is about 20 minutes too long--i can't imagine how it played with the mind-numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around); a sub-plot copped from "gods and monsters" with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines (he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week); a mix-n-match almost-four-way between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay-bashing toilet tramp, a would-be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen (and hasn't the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the "hooker with the heart of gold" as most tired stereo-type?) who exists only to be degraded; blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording.what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots; we're expected to imagine we're in an airport, grocery store office and classroom, as all the scenes in these locations consist of close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford. one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar; either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in bangor, maine, as the bar never has any patrons in it. another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the speakers, but was just more of the droning loop-music of the "score."plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable and the dialog, clearly inspired by dennis cooper, is "film-speak," meaning no humans actually talk this way. since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them; it's as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll (certainly the character of joe's sister, a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemia-crazy, seems to just simply "stop," we never know where she is in la or what her problem is...but again...does it matter?). visually the film looks very good at times, more a testament to new developments in hi-def video than anything, i suspect. the editing is pretty clunky though (there was one great edit; joe is posing naked and says, "i wanted to play sports, but..." and we cut to a shot revealing his "butt..." ha ha). composition is also odd at times (i thought i was watching sctv's parody of "persona" when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene!).one senses verow is really restraining himself from making a "naughtier" or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does, and maybe he shouldn't have held back (the frothy toothpaste/sex fantasy worked nicely, i thought, though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie)...he produces and directs this "sensitive coming of age" story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without gore...porn films without sex in them. i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn't boring, it just wasn't very good either.

this film is about a young man's painful journey to discovering his sexuality.the film is raw and unpretentious. it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers. though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times, and some events are not properly explained. i can understand it though, because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director. the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film, but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life.the low budget of the film is clearly discernible. it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done. the narration and some dialogs (particularly the scene in the classroom with the french teacher) have so much echo, which makes it hard to make out what is said. the ambient noise, notable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. when a scene cuts into another, the level of traffic noise changes.this film is probably not entertaining, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embracing his sexuality.

this movie was unbelievably bad... it's gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable. since everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination. and the plot... what plot? there really isn't any! the pacing is unbelievably slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills kittens for fun. so this movie was banned in 31 countries? i could see why... not because of the gore (boring and trite) but because it was a terrible movie. it should have been banned from existence. avoid this one like the plague. 1 out of 10

cannibal ferox (1+ outta 5 stars) miserable excuse for a movie... which you might enjoy if you really like boring, nonsensical jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence. a pair of drug dealers on the run from the mob travel to the jungles of paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine. they meet up with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks, one of whom is an anthropologist seeking to prove definitively that cannibalism does not and has not ever existed. one of the two dealers turns out to be a bit of a psychopath and he tortures and kills a couple of natives in order to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels. (and how they could even tell him when he doesn't seem to speak their language in the first place?) well, the natives are suddenly not too thrilled with white folks in their jungle and capture them all for some retaliatory torture. poor acting, poor plot and poor direction. not a decent moment of suspense in the whole dreary 90 minutes. even the special effects are not particularly convincing (though a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe). the only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of "red river valley". the following is a quote from the movie but i wouldn't be surprised if many viewers weren't saying exactly the same thing by that point: "oh god, please let her die soon. oh, let her die soon. and let me die soon too, please."

first thing i note is the music. it's nothing as amazing as ruggero deodato's cannibal holocaust's haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters, but i don't let that stop me so early in the film.one must assume that the woman researching her hypothesis for her phd dissertation that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed, one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right? or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis to be true before even being tested? that's fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted.that actually is similar to the ruggero deodato's film, just totally ill-prepared. no guns, no decent hiking clothing, just nonsense through and through.people don't go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation.but i digress...things don't get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid adventurers as they swerve to miss a jaywalking iguana, and their decoy pet ferret falls out of the truck nearly to it's demise, then to fall into a mud hole, well i guess it's time to walk.okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing. how does that scene even make any sense? all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin? after they must've spent time, and money, and preparation just getting out there. this just keeps getting worse. defiinitely some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry.mike talks about how he and his friend's were captured by the cannibals and put into cages in mud pits with 3 inch long leeches sucking on their blood. i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle, a man they mistake as a simple native, is sitting on the ground eating such leeches... wonder if they are the same ones? really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content. they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it's no big decision.obviously mike is insane, but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it's simply unrealistic.ruggero deodato's movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved, while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what befalls the americans yet again.and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless. we already got the point from the first movie, so why was the sequel made? the lieutenant's name is rizzo?! could it get any worse? oftentimes with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven't really acted in much other films and their bios are all but non existent, so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni lombardo radice in this movie who was in scorsese's gangs of new york. now lt. rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a tugboat captain. reminds me of how william shatner went from being the admiral on the uss enterprise to a cop in a car. irony, sometimes irony works out. shatner never could get the music right until his recent album "has been" which is really good, just like bono of u2 never could get a haircut right, and dan marino never could win no superbowls.sometimes irony is just sad, like christopher reeve, superman can't walk irony. the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy, i digress yet again though.at this point you can tell i'm fairly bored of even discussing cannibal ferox.cannibal holocaust's message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil? what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records, or what we do to others with malicious intent? cannibal ferox's message seems to be 'be careful what you go looking for, for you just might find it.' i will say this for cannibal ferox. when gloria comes back and writes her dissertation, asserting that cannibalism does not exist, she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear tread, but overall this movie was really bad.***/10

one of the most notorious of the banned "video nasties" of the 1980s is also one of the most excessively over-hyped. "make them die slowly" is about what you'd expect from an umberto lenzi-directed jungle potboilerinventive (yet poorly rendered) native torture techniques, some ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even sillier than "cannibal holocaust"), and lots of guts being chewed. the film's exploitative violence, though, is often only shown in brief close-up, and never dwelt on for very long, which diminishes its effect (interpret that how you may). the dialog is lenzi's usual silliness, as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them "tw@t" and the like. the cast of familiar faces (including lorraine de selle, giovanni lombardo radice, zora kerowa, and robert kerman) does their best in the face of the escalating idiocy (including a completely ludicrous "castration preservation"), but cannot save this overworked, lousy effort.

like anyone else who bought this, i was duped by the "20 pieces of extreme gore" and "banned in 20 countries" or whatever it says in the box. i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. tom savini, rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business. the revolutionized make-up effects in the 80's. today, you don't need them as everything is done on computer. but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. but i digress.watching fantastically gory films like fulci's gates to hell or even savini's crowning achievement, friday the 13th the final chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. you can't tell the difference between reality and magic.i can't imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. if that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. as many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. you don't see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords.the gore? well, it's here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but i was expecting a bit more. call me sick or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places.cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe. if you go out of your way to buy this for $20.00, you will feel cheated.3/10

i bought this thing used at a video game store's "clearance bin". i wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something i've been warned is too intense to watch; i wanted the shock value. i wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a "banned film". i was very disappointed.cannibal ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. most of the time the camera does not show you the "shocking" stabs, chops, slicing - you just see the aftermath. (they do show a breast hooking in detail). the special effects are just ok. nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. the "cannibals" are obviously poor people from central / south america who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean. these people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money, or food, or both. again...just not convincing.however, like everyone else has said, there is some real killing of animals going on here. that is the extent of the realism. to me, that was more shocking than any gutting, chopping of scalps, or castration, and even then, the animal deaths are not that gory at all - maybe just sad.

just how bad? well, compared to this movie, cannibal holocaust is citizen kane. there's the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. unlike holocaust, ferox is a straight forward movie. it doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary. in some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to holocaust's graininess. unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. they torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves. there's really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while. i was fairly lenient with my review of holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style, but in ferox's case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore.

this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust. if it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' ("ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films") these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf - i'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies. but as it stands, it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype. to sum up, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal. a fan of 70's gore should give this a try, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should pick something a little better written for their popcorn-fest.

this movie was quite a mess. there wasn't anything really going for it. the only character that had any appeal was bobbie phillips' maya and she wasn't even worth it.the plot is standard, double-cross the double-crossing double-crosser. with a few too many double crosses to make any sense. sometimes that means it "keeps you guessing" in this case it "keeps you waiting". by the end i just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot.

... ever! (i always wanted to write that:) many years ago (in 1993 as i recall it) one of my former classmates persuaded me to watch what he called "a epic masterpiece". to this day it stands out to me as the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting, the story, the effects - everything is bad. unless you are one of these people who just loves to appreciate trash, you should pass on this. however chances are that since you are reading this, you've already seen it.out of almost 500 movies this is the only non-short i've given a 1/10.i haven't seen any other low-budget asian warrior flicks, so i guess there's even worse things out there! scary... :p

so if a guy meets you and he says 'i want you to look at my erection!' don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built. yes! that's the only thing what happens in this movie! it's like the worst warholian beep i ever saw! it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it, in fact, it's less interesting to look at than that.but if you do watch lennon's erection, be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too. i mean, really, it's as if the building is being attacked by space mutants from hell or something! in the meanwhile, the building in progress is growing up as an erection can do too (in almost 20 minutes, what an accomplishment).so if someone does ask you to watch his erection, be sure he wants to videotape it all.

i saw this movie many years ago, and just for kicks decided to rent it and watch it again. the plot is a carbon copy from fright night. i did like the hairy vampire and the bug eating driver. otherwise it was not good at all.

rollerskating vampires?! i'm sorry but even for the 80's that's just way too cheesy to be remotely scary... you can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and tv shows, but that's been done once, so the sequel needed to be a little less camp, not even more outlandish! plus, the first movie had the presence of chris sarandon - a man who could even make stalking discotheques in casual knitwear seem seductive! - that this one sorely lacks, so there was no 'danger' in anything that happened, it just seemed silly.admittedly i only saw this once when i was 7, but by then already being a huge fan of the original i remember being disgusted. to me, there is no sequel to fright night, just a tacky spoof that doesn't deserve any appraisal whatsoever.

i live in rome where the turkish director of this film lives and works. from my italian friends i have heard many good things about his films...so after seeing the preview i really wanted to see "cuore sacro". i am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly improbable and naive films. i love film but this one is really heavy and bad. the main character is really crazy, and should be locked up in a madhouse...made me sympathise with the negative character of an aunt, who runs a dirty-dealing company that only wants to make money...and i consider myself an anti-capitalist...that bad!!!

cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. with a script that the screen-writers for "touched by an angel" might have passed up as being too impuissant, ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. in fact, i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.this movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending. this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like tornatore's una pura formalità or god-awful garbage like the films of m. night shyamalan. cuore sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter. i found the cinematography in general to be above average. the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother's house. for me, the grotesque parody of michelangelo's pieta when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch. one big issue that i took exception to in this film was ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place. this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows, but when employed here it seems that bubolova is no mezzogiorno. in fact besides the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it's main character. it made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad. in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate-driven societies by urging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. and while i'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view, i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object. could the characters have been anymore two-dimensional? i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless. was the "evil" aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature? it goes for the people on the side of "right" too, like the "good" aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman aurelio. and just in case we might have missed ozpetek's point, he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries. this brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color. he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black, as well as irene (when we first meet her and after her life-conversion), the evil aunt eleonora, and of course the good but confused padre carras. black is a color that suggests a definite course, the wearer's mind is set and emotionless. it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor, the business suit. it is also the color of mourning, such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo. finally, black is the color of piety, such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film. the other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart, is red. it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component. the character who wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas, and indulgent. red is a risky color in modern times; it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable. yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism, as the earliest members of cro-magnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the torah, adam, is named after the hebrew word for red. red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking back on the past where red (and by association a less self-driven attitude towards life) was more accepted. so when we encounter the red-filled room (the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a whirling dervish!) of irene's mother, "good" characters maria clara and aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red, and finally the painting of irene's mother in a formal red gown we can see where ozpetek's sympathies lie.a word or two about the soundtrack, i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story. the quasi-baroque theme that signified irene was great for it's monotony and feeling of restive malaise (the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubrick's barry lyndon, with it's masterful repetitions of an 8-bar sarabande attributed to handel). one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house. it is of the famous aria "ebben? ... ne andrò lontano" from catalani's opera "la wally". the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever. as irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter, as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive. i just have one minor question of the soundtrack, why include the famous tango yo soy maria? i love the song and personally could hear it all the time, but it didn't really fit here.

i remember vacationing in florida when this movie aired. i had set up my vcr to record it. the anticipation was killing me. i had known about the movie ever since it was announced some half a year earlier. we came back from florida 4 days after the movie aired, and i immediately watched it. i tried as hard as i could to like it, but i didn't.i am a huge 3 stooges fan. and as such i know quite a bit about them. so it wasn't like i was expecting to learn anything from the movie, and i didn't. i was more interested with the portrayals and seeing how accurate their information was. there were many things wrong with this film. the actors, the script, the reenactments, all could have been much better.paul ben-victor is a tremendously talented actor. but let's face facts, moe howard was way out of his reach. he doesn't look like him, he doesn't sound like him, and thus, he can't act like him. michael chiklis is also very talented, but his portrayal of curly didn't quite score with me, although when curly becomes ill he did very well at that. john kassir's portrayal of shemp could've been rehearsed better. it was more of a bad impression than a portrayal. worst of all was joe besser. they made him skinny, and more annoying than he really was. it was just plain laziness. i don't like the joe shorts, because, as the movie illustrates he hardly ever got hit. but he wasn't that annoying, and definately wasn't that thin. the best performance belongs to evan handler. he had the most accurate stooge portrayal. the problem with larry's character, his hair is way too frizzy and way too red. i know that's too technical, so i won't count that on my list of why i didn't like this movie.back to shemp, who just so happens to be my favorite stooge. he is written as a whining, quivering, chicken. true, he had many phobias, but he wasn't that bad. he didn't leave the group initially because he was afraid of ted healy, although he didn't like him, shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply couldn't turn down. instead of the truth, this movie chooses to make him wet the bed, on larry no less, run into a closet, and shamefully bow out of the group. another problem is that shemp made nearly as many columbia shorts as curly did as a stooge, but only one, fright night, which was his first short, is shown. his career was almost completely ignored. plus, lousy editing caused a terrible and most unforgivable error. shemp was born in early 1895, and died in late 1955. that would make him how old at death? well, here's a hint, it's not 59 as the movie states.now for the writing, which i think was flawed only because this movie was rushed out. some of the lines are dumb and could be developed and/or introduced much better than they were. the one line that really got me was at the very end of the film, when moe is showing the promoter how the eyepoke is done."that's how we do it, make contact with the brow bone, not the eyes, looks real on film though." this line was poorly written and poorly placed in the film. it's meant to be one of those lines that make the audience say oh! in amazement and i'm sure it did with some people, but the very end of the movie was not the place for this line. a better place you ask? how about when they show up at columbia for the first time and are introduced to the sound effects machine. i know initially there was no sound for the eyepoke, but moe for instance could have said, "what about this?" and eyepokes curly or larry. jules white then says "are you okay?" or "how'd you do that?" there were a lot of misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was rushed out. another one involves the origin of the name shemp, although that one isn't as bad, and so i will let that one slide.what does this film do well? it illustrates how the stooges were screwed by columbia, which they were. i'm not sure if moe was an errand boy, but that was the kind of dramatization stuff that is meant to get the viewer sympathizing with them. i know this film was a dramatization. i know not everything is going to be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect. however some of the stuff they made up and the real stuff that they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. for instance curly's stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life. i know, i know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatizations is to make real events more dramatic. curly's stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. here's what really happened. curly was sitting in a chair off screen while a scene was being shot, they called him for the final pie fight scene but there was no response. moe went to go get him and discovered his little brother head slumped, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears streaming down his face. moe then said "babe?" and tried to help him out of his chair. poor curly drops to his knees. then the ambulance was called.all in all, this movie wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't good, or even ok. this film portrays the stooges helplessly and inaccurately and sometimes goes overboard with dramatizations. there is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this film. if you don't believe me, check out a fella named stooge's list at the threestooges.com news forum. it is about a page and a half long. some things in the movie i can let slide. but others were unforgivable. the three stooges were geniuses, and a lot of today's comedy is based off of what they did. don't believe me? check out the simpsons, and more so ren & stimpy. but this film fails to capture their genius. it more so inaccurately captures their hardships, which is important, but if the title of the film is gonna be the three stooges, it has to portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything.

the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges. the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers shemp and jerome (curly) howard, also the life long friendship with larry fine. the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career. the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. the actor who plays "curly" howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved stooge. a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts.

stephen king tv movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? so why give the stooges only 96 minutes? i'm not asking for a pbs mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? the movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. i do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the stooges, but the spirit was there. after watching the movie, i pulled out a tape from american movie classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. the movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after curly has the stroke and moe needs to keep the business going. when curley started crying i lost it...like i said, the movie was good, but could have been and should have been much, much better. maybe it's fitting though...the stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.

this production is an insult to the stooges, especially moe. it is inaccurate and poorly acted. many of the events depicted just didn't happen that way and too much was left out or skipped over. read the books written by moe and his daughter joan instead. this was a waste of time.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. people just don't act that way in real life situations. my question is: who would fund such crap?the movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes. one guy falls and breaks his leg or something. the fireman arrives to help them. meanwhile, somebody starts a fire. some more bike stunts. bla bla bla.i wasted my time.do not watch this movie.

a bunch of teen dirt bikers are out in the forest riding around in circles. they're having fun; little do they know nature is about to be unleashed by an emo refugee from a deliverance or hills have eyes movie. he's armed with matches and fire accellerant. and he's got an eye that's bleeding or something. why torch a park? i dunno. maybe he doesn't like smokey the bear, or something. but he wears army/navy store fatigues, if that helps.the rangers send one single helicopter to battle the resulting blaze; that's all you ever see, except a bunch of people in a base somewhere talking a lot about the fire, but doing nothing. some cop or ranger or militiaman or whatever he is drops from the helicopter on a defective tether.everybody now rides their dirt bikes like they're auditioning for motocross. they forever pop wheelies, do evel knievel jumps, spin around etc. they argue incessantly. shots of the fire are as phony as a 3 dollar bill; it's the same footage from a dozen different angles, and the blaze never grows or moves. and you still never once see any fire fighting equipment.syfy channel movie which has about 0% science fiction attached to it. what you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects, and a story that goes nowhere (like the bikes and fire go nowhere). laughable insomniac cure.

when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire, which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. i don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. and lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. and to make things worse i have the whole set on dvd fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche. all i'm missing is the awesome tornado movie which i hear sucks balls.well until my next crap movie peace

**major spoilers** watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it "nature unleashed: fire" has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history. we have the fearless ranger jake, bryan genesse, leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume beaching mine shaft! this during a raging forest fire! it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire!***spoilers from this point on*** all this started some time ago when ranger jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner tiny, chris harz aka "the sherd", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the tiny was the culprit! as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him, fires explosions as well as impaling, could stop the crazed miner.before tiny's reappearance, or resurrection, ranger jake got involved in rescuing bikers chris mel sharon & marcus, josh cohen melanie lewis anastasia griffith & ross mccall, who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them. having the usual know it all-marcus-among the bikers things don't go as smoothly as ranger jake wanted them to go. marcus not only eggs on the meek chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but has the guy break his leg. this makes it almost impossible for ranger jake to have chris air-lifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers!for the remainder of the movie ranger jake, who put himself in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers! all this ends with jake's brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them!even though he was supposed to be the life of the party, or movie, tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun. the make-up job on tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp.ranger jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules forest ranger. in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because tiny , despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!

^^contains spoilers^^this movie is utter crap. do not watch.there is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.the acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. no one can even cry believably.if you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make no sense whatsoever.for example, i left the room for a second, while jennie garth's character was sleeping with her manager. i come back, seriously about 4 minutes later, (also i'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there) and she's sleeping with that berko guy. i gave up on this movie around the time that berko was being an ass to his fiancé in the car, because she didn't want to call off the wedding.i wasted 2 hours of my life. you shouldn't.

as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel 124. it is an urban channel. i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. i almost became a mass murderer due to this film. i have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of dookie. the lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. i would rather watch star crystal....... holy cow maybe that is not a good example. the main question i have about this film is... was it to be a morality film? the reason why i ask is because ther was one line where this lady in a wheelchair says " i would have been another gang statistic" oh my head is starting to hurt. after hearing that line i went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared watch this movie. but some sense kicked in and i just changed the channel to watch the man with the afro paint. well that is all i have to say about this movie. if you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes

i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back. it was so bad, i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. the only plot summary i can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high.(spoiler alert starts here...) when the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the "demon cop", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong. a car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. it sends him flying over the top of it, and what does the driver do??? watches the man as he falls, gets back in his car and drives away. what kind of hair-brained dolt would do that? i would've at least asked if the guy was okay.then, some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face, then, later tells reporters, "i didn't get a good look at him." my sisters and i, by then, were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter.then, there's some scene in an alley, where this girl with an afro, pulls a machine gun out of her teeny-weeny little purse. it couldn't have possibly fit!! i can hardly remember certain scenes. maybe it's because they were just that bad.cops in the film can't even jump a fence, and the acting is so wooden, it makes planks of wood look like better actors.all in all, this movie brings shame to hollywood, way more than any other flop could. you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot, which it has none of, as far as i can tell.

one night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. though tempted to turn it off, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. alas, there was none. absolutely nothing. the film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. then again, there was precious little to salvage. after a few minutes of cameron mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally terrible acting, and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. the rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous "special effects" and "makeup" to ever disgrace the screen, even for television. the main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. one can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. seriously, a handful of three-year-old kids could've produced a better project. at the end, poor mr. mitchell returns (how desperate he must've been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the aids epidemic. please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. it was so bad, even mystery science theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it.

this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. to me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. i saw this film as weak and boring. at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. at times i wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. this movie just wasn't good for me.

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. if you're looking for a nice theatrical effect, skip it and watch something else.but if you're looking for camp-value, this is it. here's my advice: gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it.

this movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free, and that it probably helped the romanian economy. other than that, hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in mississippi. to go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. it wasn't. i remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing. whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be relocated to another sector of society...maybe food service, to the deaf. if you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem oscar-worthy in retrospect. then again, if you actually ended up at this movie's profile, i imagine that it may be too late...

this story starts at the end ! so the film's opening credits advise us. unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950's. the story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.the scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke. - oh yes there was a pool of water as well. someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers.written by lou rusoff, who penned several sci-fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days, not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage. the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential. it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be.mike connors and richard denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- 'i enjoyed that film' richard denning's acting career began in 1937. he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five-o and the flying doctor series.directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer. he has made some good films and is still making them. he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe, often starring vincent price. he also made other low budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than this.i would not recommend this film to anyone.darnmay 10th september 2007

this is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. the cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.they all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie. harvey cormann's first film, it shows a certain simplicity in movie making. to avoid expensive sets, actors go through curtains to enter and exit the house (ie the studio). the location shots filmed in the hills near hollywood are the backdrop.i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s.

a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. it's the end of the world. four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. a mutant monster! seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed "a million years of evolution" (on an already living human) the result is a laughably bad, zip up the back, rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water. it rains. the monster dissolves. the remaining two characters, the hunk and the virgin. set out to repopulate the world as the caption 'the beginning' fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around 'out there'.the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of 'curtain acting' that goes on in it. one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the superabundant use of curtains in the set design. it was cheap. finished with one set-up? pull a curtain across, drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting.'curtain acting' is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in ("it looks like rain", or "here they come now, and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them!", that sort of stuff). he'll do this by standing to one side of the window - reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot - ie towards the camera - thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen, without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. there was a lot of that in this movie.

a group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending h-bomb blast. not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. one of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. richard denning plays the hero. mike connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. lori nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. not one of director roger corman's best. this is predictable black and white sci-fi.

that distinction has to go to the dungeon of harrow. at least ed wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "star" power of bela lugusi, vampira, tor johnson, criswell and lyle talbot. the dungeon of harrow has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. what could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of the island of dr. moreau or mysterious island, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. the "special effects", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a victorian interpretation of the bible. the fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat fallon and his lady, cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the castle de sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. it is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. no wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end.

this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, some spare paint and cardboard,a toy ship, a few friends who acted in community theater, and the incorrect notion you can make a film. the end result is an unwatchable time-waster that you'll skip through, unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first.the acting in the opening scene (especially by the rotund lee morgan as 'captain') and the toy ship "crashing" into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you're in for (with all the foam, it looks like this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink. i guess boyette figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time). in terms of bad cinema, the funny thing is "dungeon of harrow" seems to have inspired (maybe by coincidence) the twist ending of "manos: the hands of fate". yep, it's the same lame "i was the victim, and now i take the mad villain's place" ironic ending. the bigger irony is that two inept, talentless filmmakers could make two equally-wretched, texas-filmed horror movies and get away with it.monotone nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line (why they were great is never broached), boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes (we're also treating to a droning narration throughout the film). sadly, we aren't so lucky. his family's toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink, and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman, conveniently deposited on a mad count's island.meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a blackstone's magic kit outfit, assaults him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats. . . all the icky stuff). the count (william mcnulty) overacts worse than shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting.i'd be mad too if i had to be in this disaster. the woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs, and the two jerks are captured by his manservant. the count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he slaps his manservant around a lot (apparently his greatest joy), fatboy gets tortured, there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse, the rotting leper hag-in-a-wedding-dress countess in the dungeon (she digs the nerdy noble and is the only effective & creepy thing in the movie), a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table, the blubbery captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway (aking to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions). . . it's all an ugly haze to me. i spent most of my time on the fast-forward button.anyway, the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yeah, we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean). they don't, since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the would-be rescuers away. honestly, i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance. they head back to the castle, the nurse starts rotting like the countess (and your stomach, by this time), and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the . . . dungeon of harrow!!!! blech!i love old, lousy horror films, but they must have some sort of entertainment value. i feel ripped off, even at the low low price of $5.99 for this biscuit. mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun. i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments. wrong! avoid this tripe at all costs, and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere. this movie makes corman's "the terror" like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.

if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this stinkburger.don't get me wrong i loooooovvveeee a good crappy movie. i am a big fan of films like octoman, wizard of mars, queen king and others. real classics of b-cinema.but this film actually makes jack nicolson and boris karloff in the terror look like an academy award winner!! the dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. "i will now condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. the acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.the story? what story, a count is exiled because his wife had leprosy? i'm still not sure on that count. a (rich?) fleet one and the captian of one of his ships crash on the island? people acting unnaturally? ok, i like camp in b-films a lot, there lies a lot of it's charm, but this was just dumb..plain dumb. a salty sea captian who sounds as well versed as a college professor? a fleet owner who is as clueless as they come (i felt this guy had no idea of how to play it, one scene he's spanish acting, the next english/european)? the count, who's not sure if he's a reincarnation or really desade (don't ask me how desade figures into this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and i still couldn't figure it out.the scare factor? i could show this turkey to my small grandkids and only worry about them sleeping through it. i like a lot of early 60's horror movies, and some still have good shocks, but this thing...never had a shock, or even a hint of of a scare.on the info on the back it says, "this movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare." the only degradation is watching this movie. it's 90 mins.(the case says it's 74 mins.) of your life you do not get back.i paid only a buck, yes one buck, for this and another film. i still feel like i am owed .50 cents for even sitting though this.to sum up dungeon of harrow had no one named harrow in it, but, it did have a lovely cardboard dungeon.

why can't a movie be rated a zero? or even a negative number? some movies such as "plan nine from outer space" are so bad they're fun to watch. this is not one. "the dungeon of horror" might be the worst movie i've ever seen (some of anyway. i had to fast forward through a lot of it!). fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies i've seen, but thankfully, i can't remember them. the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. the special effects looked like a fifth grader's c+ diorama set in a shoebox. the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant. he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits. i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed. this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as "the manipulator", the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual (one time) hollywood leading man-mickey rooney. the only time i would recommend watching "the dungeon of harrow" (or "the manipulator" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (i'm kind of cheap) i'd have to have $7 or $8 bucks for "dungeon" and at least ten for "manipulator". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer

this movie tries to be more than it is. first of all, the acting is horrible. you have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. the plot is quite interesting. a shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. if this weren't bad enough, some guy named count de sade is living there as well. he lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs. there's another woman who doesn't speak and his wife, who is a leper. anyway, things get bad as these men have to deal with this nut case. he is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. the rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape. it has an ironic ending which i won't reveal and it kind of rescues the film. i wouldn't bother if i were you.

a couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. it just seems to drag on and on. and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point. as an example of 60's gothic horror, this is strictly a bargain basement example. i sadly can't recommend this one really.

"dungeon of harrow" had a lot of things that could've made this quite a good horror film. creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. but sadly to say this wasn't made very well.a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle, his slave, and a mute maid. the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them, and the mute maid who befriends them, to torture and imprisonment. sound not-bad right? well, not quite. i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen, but now i hesitate. because it had so much potential it can't really be called "one of the worst." however, seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film. all in all, it's not a very good movie.there is a very gothic-suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride, adorned in a tattered wedding dress. this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene. man i wish this was a better movie! this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late-night chiller, but ultimately took all the wrong turns. i suggest someone remake this one.

this weird movie from texas is about fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s c&w singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by count desade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. the count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. meanwhile, creepy former nurse cassandra tells fallon the secrets of the castle. the countess has leprosy and went mad! fallon is trapped but brings supplies. the captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave. fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it's her wedding day. the leper bride is horny, bu cassandra kills her. fallon and cassandra escape the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. desade kills the slave and fallon kills desade. fallon and cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year, but when the supply ship comes, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they're both lepers now. they live for years in the castle...fallon's hair turns gray and cassandra goes bonkers. fallon puts her in the dungeon. our tale of love and leprosy ends.so bizarre it's watchable, and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.

the basic idea behind "dungeon of harrow" isn't all bad. the acting, however, is bad. the lighting is bad. the music is bad. the scenes of torture are without emotion. there really isn't much there to recommend this film. you know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say "special guest star" and list someone you've never heard of. might as well say "rex hamilton as abraham lincoln." because there's really no one in this movie you can identify. there are one or two decent moments, mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawner.

buyer beware. the alpha video release uses a print that defies description. the movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. the print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. after 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. it looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception. adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that i can recollect. even the voice over narration is stupor inducing. every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor. i found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out. for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end. it's one of those so-bad -it's- good movies but i wish that someone would find a half decent print.

my bad film guru (and the president of the exposed film society) sprang this one on us last week. there was no denying the demented gleam in his eye as he pulled it out of its brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "the most dangerous game", filmed on a budget of about $2.95.of course, $2.95 went a lot further back in 1962, but still...anyway, there is certainly a lot to dislike about this film. it abounds with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the 'repeating musket' that fired twice in two minutes without benefit of a reload). the hero is a wuss who stands by while his wounded friend fights the henchman and gets killed. more? ok -the plot is a shambles with no continuity to speak of. the movie wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' who serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows him again. the hero is choked unconscious by the henchman but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and first meets his host. the mute servant girl is captured, put on the rack...and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in this predicament) just sort of "forgets" about her. more? well, the sets are cheap, and the special effects are cheaper (the makeup is an exception to this). much of the plot is carried by the narrator's droning, monotonic voice-over, which carries less dramatic impact than the menu recital at denny's. most of the dialog is simply ridiculous and stilted , as if it was translated from japanese. ("i demand that our conversation be pleasant!!!") and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot, as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (note - this last may have been the fault of a bad print, rather than the camera crew). but there were a couple of nice moments here and there. the makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors were looked interesting, especially the mute servant girl and the countess. and in spite of everything, there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found, very nasty and disturbing.so what was the deal with this movie? i thought about it a bit, and realized that director/writer pat boyette basically tried to put a story from of the old "ec" horror comics on film. that would account for the stilted dialog, the sketchy character development (in a comic, physiognomy = character even more than in film), the loopy interior logic of the story ("ec" horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty "shock" ending and weren't big on psychological realism), the over reliance on the narrative voice (which belongs in captions over the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the grisly pictures that the old ec artists did so well.in fact, i'd be willing to bet that when boyette saw his leading man during casting, he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky, shambling figures and caved in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world.. he used costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living ec comics characters. (see: the leading lady's blank beauty, the count's strong bony features, oddly bronze skin and sharp chin, the platinum 'do on the tall, bony black henchman, etc.) this would explain the movie's failings. boyette knew how to 'frame' things, but he didn't know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. boyette knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. he wouldn't be the first person with this problem of course - look at what joel schumacher did to "batman". but he didn't have a big budget to hide behind.in any case, i'm imagine that boyette walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about "dungeon of harrow"than the folks who post on this film's message boards. he did, within certainly vague boundaries, what he set out to do, and you have to respect him for it...even if you don't care for "harrow".

**may contain spoilers**the main character, a nobleman named fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. count lorente de sade (pronounced "dee-sayd") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. he routinely beats mute servant anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. inadvertant laughs are provided by giant "nubian" slave mantis who talks with a deep south accent and helps de sade hunt down trespassers in the style of the most dangerous game. de sade's crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner. (this scene was viewed on late-night tv by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood.) the one nearly-normal person in sight is cassandra, who has self-deprecation down to a science. ("i used to be a nurse, now i'm not much of anything.") she and fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de sade and mantis combined.	this movie was shot in san antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (i'll say this much for mr. boyette--he does showcase his fixatation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) it's rather like an andy milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers. the period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the handicapped and all-around misanthropy makes one wonder if andy wasn't called in as a consultant. however, milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which looks like it was shot in a fish tank. also, a film made in texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. glorious eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves. fallon's initial encounter with the leprous countess is truly horrifying, as is the movie's parting shot. if the rest had been half as harrowing, the dungeon of harrow would have been a terror classic. instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash-fiends will love, for all the wrong reasons.

okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). this baby falls into the "so bad it's entertaining" category to me, and for that alone i would give it a star. the effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day. you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning, too! it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago. while the alpha dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something, i actually liked that in this case!

the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. the leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. so, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. you don't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company.what a load of leftest excrement! looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of communism's grip on this region for 45 years. but no, it was the american war on iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms, and the constipation i had last week.the film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block. you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair. we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight, beat her up, then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. no one sees this or calls the police, and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase. even better, we later see 4-5 women lined up in the centre of london in -again- broad daylight to be sold, one of them has a smashed face, and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening. you can't make this stupidity up.i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood, but apparently i was mistaken.

the movie begins with much voice-over, a bad sign. then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence-insulting scenes involving trappers and indians. but, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow. meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky indians sit around watching them. it's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "blazing saddles". there is a minor flaw in this comparison; "across the wide missouri" is not a comedy.

of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. even ford. but this is one of his worst. even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a bonanza or big valley. yet there is one moment, typical wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the indian wife of gable. she has gone to give her baby some water and wham is killed by an arrow instantly. no warning. nada. one of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema. particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western. of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with wellman's total indifference, apparently, to the film. even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.

for those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. garden state tends to be one of those movies. sure, zach braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. people have compared this film to the graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. garden state isn't atrocious, but its isn't great.first off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of large into his former life. after ten years, people tend to act like he never left. where's the awkwardness? of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which i will say was portrayed rather accurately). the film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. however, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like peter saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). it wasn't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.

"garden state" is another of these "indie"-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). where the picture is lacking is in zach braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.when you're as young as braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. in garden state, he plays andrew largeman, a semi-successful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother, who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. he appears to have no feeling about any of this; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old, and has no particular despondency over losing his mother (in fact, he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his, who works as a cemetery grave-digger). it all smacks heavily of "beautiful girls", also about a guy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang with his old friends, with a little "ordinary people" thrown in on the side. it's really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life, given his father and his useless friends (i'm surprised he didn't kill himself), who are still living their "lives" as though they're still in high school, partying with dumb bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the "retarded quarterback" (natalie portman's character, the most aware person in the movie, does), and say things, like "hey, i remember you from junior year". these guys are such losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap forward. even one friend, who made millions inventing a silent velcro, has no real reason to live, because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying. and you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, which keeps from "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, like an adult would. then he meets sam (natalie portman) a sort-of lost girl, who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size. anyway, they fall in love, and braff learns to "feel" again. the clichés come fast and furious. braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game. in one scene, braff and portman are in the millionaire kid's house, playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard movie-schtick, i swear, i half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire. in another, braff visits a doctor (ron liebman) to get his junk refilled, and liebman tells him (in easily the worst line in the movie) "the body can play tricks on you. i once found my ex-best-friend's cufflinks in my wife's purse, and i didn't have an erection for a year and a half." obviously, no licensed physician would ever say that, but it's dirtbag poetry, a nod from braff to, i guess, his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them, just as the "37" joke in "clerks", was kevin smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies. anyway, braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope; the story plays itself out predictably. but if you're going to have a movie that's wall-to-wall clichés, at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it. and braff does. he has the right sort of vacancy, of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out andrew both real and poignant, and natalie portman (also of beautiful girls) gives the movie a big lift. with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood, she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion. jean smart is surprisingly good as portman's mother, and peter saarsgard (though much better in "shattered glass") is notable as the gravedigger friend. i would recommend "garden state" if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies, but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few "f**ks" and "awesomes" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material. it doesn't.

wave after wave of directionless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and mired in cliché-driven dialogue which builds to a crecendo of awfulness and cheese by the end. throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters, who are actually very dull, and just don't quite work and who clunk through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits, driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the whinings of coldplay. the film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, rudimentary humour of the film in general) but by the end, the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out. watch this film at your peril.

i've got to say that i'm not a massive fan of troma films. granted, i've only seen three of them (or four including this one), but two (blood sucking freaks and mothers' day) are widely reputed to be the best, which leads me to believe that all the others aren't worth seeing. that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day, which is a troma take on the over-popular eighties slasher. while the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it's never particularly good either; and by the end, all i could think about was 'why did i bother watching this?'. anyway, the plot sees some girl die on a race track, and shortly thereafter; more people start dying. naturally, there are a few possible suspects; but it's hard to really care about anything that happens. of course, in slasher terms; it's the gore that is most important, and given troma's track record where the red stuff is concerned, i was expecting buckets of it. there are some decent kill scenes, and some of them are gory; but it's never very shocking, which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar. it's worth noting that there's a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley, but the rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning. the direction, plot and its execution are all very mundane; and i will say that unless you're a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made; don't bother with this film.

high school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against coach george michaels(christopher george playing him as a major butt-head who is very demanding of the athletes under his watch). he'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of. soon disturbed parents call principal guglione(michael pataki)wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party. inspector halliday(carmen argenziano)begins snooping around campus at worried parents' request. instantly a beleaguered michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker. ensign anne(patch mackenzie)returned home from her base in guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene. kevin badger(e danny murphy)is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star.rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably. low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak. linnea quigley has an amusing role as horny student dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud(the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed dolores outside of the prom party). vanna white has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker. virgil frye has a silly role as an inept officer.

when i went to see this film, let's not say that i had high expectations. but merely that i had a faint hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of tv's "da ali g show".but as one might expect, this cannot translate from a half hour tv show to a 90 minute film. the movie had no appeal what so ever, and resorted entirely to toilet and juvenile sexual humour. basicaly, i should have ditched it halfway through but was silly enough to think it might somehow improve by the end, how wrong i was. i loved the show but hated the movie. this movie is only for those who find fellatio by canines amusing...

"graduation day" is a result of the success of "friday the 13th." both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. if you enjoy that type of film, i'd recommend "graduation day." if not, i wouldn't. there's nothing new here, just the same old killings.even though i've given the film a 4 out of 10, i will say that it's not a repulsive film. it is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative.

"graduation day" was released in may 1981, during the height of the slasher film craze. earlier that year, fans had been subjected to flicks like "my bloody valentine", "just before dawn", "friday the 13th part 2", and "the burning" and theaters still were expecting flicks such as "halloween ii", "the prowler", and "happy birthday to me". i have seen all of these films, and out of all the popular 1981 slashers "graduation day" is by far the worst.what "graduation day" amounts to is an exercise in poor, low-budget film-making with bad acting, bad writing, pointless characters, pointless scenes, unneeded nudity, cheesy dialogue, and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well. and who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the film (the opening scene's music is only rivaled by the music that plays during a chase scene). however when renting a movie like this a person should be aware that those details will be in this film. so why isn't "graduation day" considered a classic like "halloween", "friday the 13th", "a nightmare on elm street", "my bloody valentine", "the burning", or "prom night"? why do fans still seek those films but disregard this without care?where slasher films need to succeed above all other areas is in the pacing. there is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher, and "graduation day" moves pretty slow. the most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up; there are numerous pointless characters who are introduced and who are never allowed the chance to be a suspect in the murders or be a victim. there's a sleazy teacher, a stressed principal, a cunning secretary, a dopey school security guard, a clueless detective, an alcoholic step father, a mindless grandmother, and a mom to an earlier victim still grieving. all of these characters could have a motive to killing or a reason to getting killed, but they are all wasted. the worst part is that the story still focuses on them, and at times designates entire scenes just to flesh out their character. but for what?what does amaze me about "graduation day" and its small fanbase is that people aren't more amazed by the death scenes. fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in "the burning", the washing-machine death in "my bloody valentine", the kabob death in "happy birthday to me", the upside down death in "friday the 13th part 3", and hot tub death in "halloween ii", and even the car hood death in "madman". but where is the respect for some truly unique (even though cheesy) deaths in "graduation day". one victim gets impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword, while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin. the best death includes spikes under a landing mat. why aren't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films?"graduation day" tries hard to be a great and unique film, but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience. its not the worst of its kind (try checking out "don't go in the woods... alone") and there is a bit of suspense, plus it delivers just what fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia) but "graduation day" will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made. it's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a low-budget - however it is a question of ideas, creativity, and craftsmanship. that's all any type of movie making is...recommended for hardcore slasher fans. general horror fans might get a little bored, and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear. it's not the worst slasher film ever made, but its a long way from being the best.

while i am a long-time shatner fan (since we used to watch trek re-runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s), i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film, whether for personal development or business reasons. did he lose a bet?as a movie fan, i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones. but "shoot or be shot" doesn't have any flair or funny bits, unintentional or not.while unrated, there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you'll miss it nudity, cartoonish gunfire "violence" with the endless bullet gunfights), so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the mpaa to rate it. this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out.of the eight people that were in the theatre with us, four of them left mid-way, muttering statements like "this is stupid".shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter. the examination board stamps his request "insane". he runs into a group of z-grade moviemakers who "shoot on video because its 80% cheaper than film" and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint. there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but for the most part, that is the whole movie.if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner "art" film, see "free enterprise" instead, it is a much better film.

even before this film it is clear to see that ali g has become the exact character he set out to parody. i am not a fan of sacha baron cohen's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke. a paper-thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and i must admit i did cringe when i saw such respected thespians as charles dance and michael gambon stoop so low for employment. saying that i must admit (even if i am quite ashamed to) that i did raise a titter on more than one occasion, and however bad this film was it was never boring, and never once did i consider switching it off (mainly due to the gorgeous rhona mitra). saying that, only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious.

first off, let me say i wasted halloween movie night by watching this garbage. second, let me inform you that the current dvd available by shriek show is not uncut, so you gore hounds will be very upset. third, that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut, well, you see where i'm going.i know a lot of horror fans dig this movie. it is atmospheric, shot in the woods with some very nice scenery, waterfalls and such. but after the opening kill, which has a very brutal shot of a machete being jammed through a hunter's crotch, you get no real brutal kills after that. and, with a slasher movie, you sort of want that. at least, i do. the director and co. do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea, several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties. the only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films. they are sort of likable. the kids have a reason for being there: one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain. but what is not explained is why his family has property there. there is no cabin or house, so why buy property in east jesus, especially if you aren't a hunter or whatnot? well, i'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes, but that just seems unusual. anyway, two squealing backwoods inbreds show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one. and, as i said before, you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning. the ending has a sort of off the wall kill by connie, but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film, the forest, which is mind-numbing.if shriek show had been able to get a real uncut print, then this review might have been a little more forgiving, but this is the day and age of uncut/unrated dvd releases of old obscure films for cine-hounds like me. when you slight us, you get the crud review. sadly, the presence of the great fatherly george kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to set it apart from the other garden variety trash that was churned out back in the day.

ok, yes i know i'm a philistine, and i have no knowledge of, nor love for opera. i readily admit that i might feel differently about this film if i did. but i don't. so, for those of you like me, skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty (sometimes unclothed) girls. for what it's worth, i thought the first segment with theresa russell (who i didn't recognize) was the best of the lot.

this is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on tv for far far too long. everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again. ok, from the start, the first couple of series were quite good. you had an entertainment manager (simon cadel) being pursued by his deputy played by ruth madoc, a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic child-hating punch and judy man, a bent jockey, and a stand up comedian. as said earlier, it started well but went on way too long. once simon cadel left it went downhill fast, you were getting dire story lines, and a new entertainments manager who ruth madoc (again) threw herself at. when a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over. if this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic. as it is, it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series.

unlike the other spaghetti westerns, this one has characters that almost make sense, and can be identified to some degree. it still has the goofy gunplay of other spaghettis westerns. a spaghetti, by the way, is another word for a western with no plot, no characters you can care about, and goofy gunplay that doesn't make a bit of sense for the era, and relying on great music to make audiences feel something. this one is more lighthearted, like the ones that bud spencer and terence hill made together. they, too, were superior to the junk made by eastwood and others, which sado-masochists make their friends watch, if they get a chance. it looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie, too. it was good to see a giant actor like gilbert roland, who wasn't even mentioned on the movie rental box, yet who was clearly the biggest name. his character was very enjoyable. there is a three way standoff at the end, which is much superior to the one it spoofs (the good the bad and the ugly), simply because the characters are at least a bit likable and a bit identifiable. not a good movie, but has a bit of fun to it.

any gun can play (2 outta 5 stars) totally routine "spaghetti western" starring that guy who used to play "kookie" on "77 sunset strip". the plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to track it down. this is one of those "lighthearted" westerns... which means lots of labored attempts at "comedy"... and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences (you can tell this isn't ennio morricone's work). george hilton plays a bounty hunter called "stranger"... but he doesn't leave much of an impression... he just doesn't have the style of clint eastwood or franco nero, who are able to do a lot with a sparsely-written character. the ending is a complete homage/parody of the ending of "the good, the bad and the ugly"... though it's barely amusing enough to be considered a "parody". the highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes... which features actors patterned after clint eastwood, lee van cleef and someone else (is he supposed to be eli wallach? franco nero? it's not very clear...) who are confronted by stranger. it's an amusing in-joke for fans of sergio leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados... but i imagine no one else would see the point.

undoubtedly, the least among the spaghetti westerns i've been watching lately: basically a low-brow rip-off of leone's the good, the bad and the ugly (1966) with three disparate characters outwitting one another (and occasionally forming shaky alliances) in their search for hidden gold. leonard maltin rated it a bomb; while it's harmless enough, it's also totally routine and, fatally, the three main roles are stereotypes, that is to say, uninteresting: eddie byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train; gilbert roland is the "legendary" but ageing mexican bandit (his frequent lapses into spanish when excited are quite corny!) who, apparently, is still irresistible to women; george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate clint eastwood's man with no name figure. director castellari - whom i saw at the italian b-movie retrospective held during the 2004 venice film festival, where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present! - shows little genuine feeling for the western (on the strength of two above-average franco nero efforts in the genre, i ordered his collaboration with castellari keoma [1976]...i'm keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the film's tongue-in-cheek approach is equally lamentable.

congratulations to christina ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film. ricci is my favorite actress: she is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates, which gives credence to the often misapplied term "star." the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons, but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative...more on that later. the cast at first glance is excellent, but come to think of it, jessica lang as the jewish mother is too protestant and not exactly right, ann hetch doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book, and when your making a movie, how can you justify saying no to anne heche and jessica lange? but the real problems are in the film's construction: first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth wurtzle character, and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in. unfortunately do to the flashback construction, lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book. this is a major problem. this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch. she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors, both society and the home, and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case. she is so talented, and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on, that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization. this is missed on the film.ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say: it is a biopic of one severely affected girl, but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together; that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee. the film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across compellingly, and that's too bad. is prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical crutch? these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. the challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional america, but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes.ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt, and one of the best of her acting career.michele williams is also superb in her role.

i seldom see a film with such a cast, such a potentially strong story and based on a bestselling book that has been this weak and to some extent unwatchable... the premise of a story reads like a brent easton ellis novel - a lot of drugs, hopelessness and self-induced tragedy as a young elisabeth wurtzel (played by christina ricci) tries to cope with being a suicidal loser, that can't seem to accept that she is actually living a good life and that basically she is pathetic for being such a baby... christina ricci is not only playing a tragic personae, but also a tragic actor, whose sobbing and screeching for the most part of the movie actually make you want to shout - kill yourself already and let us get to the credits rolling... the director is of no help as he supplies absolutely no pace and the story feels so disjointed you have no idea what this damn girl is actually on about. the director apparently was on prozac when directing this imitation of a movie and hence let the movie go on autopilot making it an unbearable mess.the only redeeming features are a sympathetic jason biggs, as wurtzel's boyfriend (who thankfully decided to dump the self-indulgent egocentric egomaniac) and an unbelievably good jessica lange as the cry-babies mother. lange apparently can not be brought down by terrible script, directing and dire co-actors. pure class.i don't know if this is really who wurtzel is or was, but the film has successfully made me totally uninterested in her writings.in the end i finished watching this movie and instantly started to think: ok. time to watch something, that actually is about real problems...

the film begins with a dandy gunfight, where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter--a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the man with no name from the clint eastwood trilogy (fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more and the good the bad and the ugly).immediately after, you see this man in a gold train filled with union soldiers. naturally, the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys, so they are quickly neutralized. however, in a twist, one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (gilbert roland) and rides away with the gold. soon, roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. but, just at that moment, the army turns up and kills the traitor....bummer. however, the man with no name wannabe thinks roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to roland by the traitor holds the key. a strange banker, also is thrown into the mix. all three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho.overall, this is not a particularly distinguished western. much of it is the plot, some of it is that george hilton (a uruguayan despite the american sounding name) isn't as interesting as eastwood or some of the other premier spaghetti western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks. so often the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added. plus, it just isn't very good stuff as well. this clearly isn't the work of ennio morricone--music master of the spaghetti genre.overall, just a time passer--and not a particularly good one to boot.

lately, i've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. there are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. this movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. although, it's a spoof of this genre, and for me the way it was done just didn't work and made for a disappointing movie.this movie can easily be divided into two parts.the first part is great; it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter (a.k.a. the stranger) going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded, in part, by a banker. over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money. there are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre, but the comedy doesn't disrupt the overall story.the second half of the film is where the comedy goes over-the-top and essentially ruins the movie. the turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place. from this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid-silly spoof.there are three horrible fist-fight scenes (one at the river, one in the market and one at the baths) that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn't bad enough. the fighting is so fake it's ridiculous, and since the sound is out-of-sync with the picture it makes it even worse. in the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus; it's clownish. although, the worst part of these fight scenes is the music; it's this light-hearted, sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'hee-haw'. these scenes practically derail the main story.overall, this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western, but the comic turns just mucked it up. if you want to see a good western spoof then see 'blazing saddles'. if you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.

there's considerable amount of money behind this production, so the look of it is very good. it includes some interesting appearances by gilbert roland, eddie burns, and a brief cameo at the beginning by christopher lee. there are a few exciting gunfights, and a humorous bit or two - the satire on django, the man with no name, and sabata is amusing, especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the mexico revolution.the trouble is, there isn't any purpose in satirizing the spaghetti western as is attempted here. the key element in the spaghettis is irony, which easily blends into comedy; in fact the source of all spaghetti's is kurosawa's yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the trinity films, which are both openly spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy. so why bother satirizing a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself? consequently, i found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing. none of these characters were people i would ever care about, the story was generically cliché, and the production values only reflected the money involved, not the passion of the director. over all, a banal and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks.

i honestly don't know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as ernest goes to africa. aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this hour-and-a-half waste of time and life. it is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act, film, and edit this piece of trash, and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the ernest series.during the opening credits of the movie, we see ernest posing next to various african objects, such as wooden masks and the heads of african animals, making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh. this opening scene gives the viewer a taste of ernest's frequent attempts at humor, and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95% of the time.the first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is. everyone in the film is a typical c-movie actor, but linda kash stands out as especially terrible. she is the epitome of overacting; all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you'd find only in a middle school play. most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance. jim varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then, but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard, trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices.ernest goes to africa begins in africa, where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an african tribe. the gems then make their way back to the united states, where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market. he hides them in a bucket of "two for a dollar" items, and then runs from the scene. ernest is looking for a gift to buy for rene, a waitress he likes, so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems. he later takes them back to his house, paints them, and glues them together to make a yo-yo. he gives the yo-yo to rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe, and she wants a man of adventure. rene and ernest are tracked down by the henchmen, and are then brought to africa to be kept as prisoners.most of the movie really doesn't make sense. once ernest is in africa, he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river. in the next scene, we see him as a hindu servant named "hey you." his skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth. at first, i thought jim varney was playing another role in the film in addition to ernest, but i immediately recognized ernest's idiocy once hey you began to speak.another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the african wilderness. rene and ernest have taken an ostrich farmer's truck and are being chased by the henchmen. driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road, both henchmen are shooting at ernest, who is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. ernest, on the other hand, is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver. the henchmen never hit ernest once during the five minute chase, but ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face, making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke. i should also add that ernest is slingshotting the eggs, two at a time, from a large bra.the set design is also incredibly poor in this movie. there is a large portion of the film in which rene and ernest are walking in africa, trying to find civilization. during their hike, we see them walking through fields and jungles, which probably could have been shot anywhere in the united states. the fields are simply plain grassy fields, with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near africa (they could have at least digitally added some african trees in the background), and the jungles look like the woods of rural connecticut with papier mâchè skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from trees. according to imdb.com, the film was actually shot in south africa, but i still wouldn't believe that at all.the movie goes on and on, ernest joke after ernest joke. the rest of the movie doesn't really make any sense either; the african tribesmen all speak english for some reason, and ernest is later challenged to a "battle of truth" by the lead henchman, who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja, yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive. the henchman has a table of axes, swords, knives, and maces before him, while ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear, and a few other worthless items. however, ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day.overall, this movie is painful to watch. i couldn't handle it in one sitting; i had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate varney's humor. they should really put a surgeon's general warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie. i would have to say that out of all the movies i have ever seen, none comes close to being as pitiable as ernest goes to africa.

ok, so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie. unfortunately for us, we chose 'ernest goes to africa.' i have never laughed so hard in my entire life. this movie is beyond bad. i have literally pooped out better films than 'ernest goes to africa.' (i poop films) the highlight of this movie, for me at least, was the opening sequence, when ernest is making silly faces. when they showed him with a head the size of a peanut, i lost it. perhaps i found this so funny because at that point i was the most high. perhaps you are right.if i had to guess what george w. bush's favorite movie is, i would guess 'ernest goes to africa.' never before have i seen a movie rely more on 1950's stereotypes of people of color. there were times when words escaped me and i just stared in awe.as i was watching this, i couldn't help but wonder, is this movie meant for children? do literate adults actually watch this? how could there possibly be a whole franchise of 'ernest' movies? is this really my life? is this real? i hated this movie.

having first read the novel, i don't mind,for the purposes of filming, how differently it is scripted, as long as it adheres to, or at least includes, the plot. for reasons known only to hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored, and a different story line added. the reason this novel passed the test of time, is, no doubt, due to the interweaving of both the characters, and plot, as a whole. to interfere with this structure, is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line, and therefore the intension of the story teller. although a matter of opinion, the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired. characters, described as very fat, should, at least, be made to look portly, to allow for the character to have credibility. the days of slavery can't be over, or surely, actors of this calibre would have been in revolt, at such a travesty of the story. the face of marian halcolme is described as being manly in appearance,... tara fitzgerald's very feminine appearance doesn't ring true. again laura fairly is described as being 'fair', if not 'ethereal', so, with dark hair, she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel. ....badly done, hollywood!j. hunter

this is supposed to be based on wilkie collins' _the_woman_in_white_, but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters' names, the time period, and the settings. if they were going to change the story so thoroughly, i don't understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from wilkie collins. go read the book. it's much better.

and one of 'em are bad movies. the title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not fish. this is not the dante-directed "piranha" of '78 (which did have the fish) and is also known as "piranha, piranha." a trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, hook up with a local hunter/trapper named caribe somewhere in the amazon jungle. unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film resume of william smith, who plays caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece. smith may have also refused to film the ending or cut out before they finished filming (see end of this comment).as mentioned elsewhere, this pic has a lot of filler - lengthy shots of the local wildlife (birds) - and the central set piece, a motorcycle race, which goes on too long. the reason this gets a second star from me is, of course, william smith, who can't really save this sludge, but once again proves why he was the 'go to' guy 30-35 years ago if you needed a really nasty villain; at his best, smith could be really terrifying. he's the type who enjoys killing, possibly in sadistic fashion, and you get that sense from the evil grin he usually puts on when a mood strikes him. physically, he's very imposing, and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much doomed within the first half-hour. this was what smith brought to most of his roles; it seems hopeless for the other characters against this manlike monster. unfortunately, the movie continues to muddy things up to the very end, as if a minute of footage was lost - a confusing, incomplete climax.

this movie starts out as if it were a comedy. it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards, especially in the airport sequence. william smith plays the role of "caribe," a hunter, who is quite twisted and deranged. smith seems to always play villains such as in "the ultimate warrior" (1975), and "the frisco kid" (1979) to name a few, although in this film the villainous role seems laughable. this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time, such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning, and the long silly motorcycle race. i give this film 1/10. i would have liked to see this film on "mystery science theatre" it would have been hilarious.

one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: i was working in roger corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, i was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). one afternoon julie corman, roger corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. i'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. i got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card. whatever the reasons she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room i was working in, and i was the nearest person to the machine. i started the tape.fade in: on screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera. behind him, screen left, was a door that opened into the room. against the far wall was a coat rack. a second character entered through the door and started talking. the first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts pans or dolly shots. just one locked off camera). the second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. julie corman said "i've seen enough." and left the room.what she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot. opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? nope, sorry. next! that's how long you've got. ten seconds. cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead.i was reminded of that moment while i watched the opening of this piece of crap. after an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages. a man carrying a gun laughs. a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. god this is boring! cut to the interior of the airport. two men meet. aha! something is happening! they shake hands. cut to a different angle of the two men -- and the director crosses the line.the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up. 'not crossing the line' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience. audiences don't like to be confused. mystified? baffled? puzzled and intrigued? yes. audiences love all of those. confused? no. you loose them. they walk out. 'not crossing the line' is one of those things they pound into you at film school, or should. it's basic stuff. it's not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie.i thought, "i've seen enough". and switched off.

the sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is awful, the female leading actress is chubby, and the story is... wait a minute... there is no story...! the plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. if you expect to to see piranhas, you might be disappointed. this movie has nothing to do with the piranha movies from 1978 and 1981. actually, i can only think of one scene involving piranhas.the only thing that i liked about this movie, besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. it's written and sung by jim stein and it's called "love all things that love the sun".i don't recommend this movie. it is so bad it's not even funny to watch. i fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and i am the kind of person who watches anything.

i picked up this dvd for $4.99. they had put spiffy cover art on the package, along with a plot summary that had nothing to do with the movie. the acting is terrible, and the writing is worse. the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder. i paid too much.

an awful travesty of the greek resistance. senorita cruz badly miscast as a cephalonian greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good english speaking greek actresses so why pick a spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an english actor as her father, supposedly a greek doctor!? many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from greek theatre and tv series. the only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who has successfully portrayed a greek was anthony quinn (as the macedonian lignite miner zorba in zorba the greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the greek tycoon,and as a greek colonel in the guns of navarone.there is some historical truth reflected in the film. people who remember the italian occupation of the ionian islands agree that the italians were not harsh, unlike the germans who succeeded them. also mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the greek army in the albanian campaign. after the germans intervened in the balkans they allowed the italian military to occupy certain parts of greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to italian forces, rather than to the germans. as portrayed in the film is quite plausible, although i am not certain this actually happened.

this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness. not only was the name a complete misnomer--since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas--but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot. when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately i waited until the end in my case. that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim.

piranha starts out as expected, stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. i thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. it starts off like so many others, showing nothing but shots off untouched amazon rain forest. for all i know it could be florida. at this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. instead you get the acting talents of william smith, who starred in l.a. vice and angels die hard. he plays caribe, an acclaimed hunter, who i would describe him as jack palance light. he is bigger in stature, but not quite the jack palance goodness. as for natives, you don't really get that many. where's the piranha? should i even ask that question? caribe now hunts humans, i guess. he doesn't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though, just stares at them. caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over-dramatic smokey and the bandit kind of way. the motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence. i can't tell you how many times i've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle. never actually. do they live, do they die? will you care? anybody wanna race on motorcycles? caution: this film contains extreme dry look. my advice is to rent a jack palance classic like craze.

let's see: what are the advantages to watching piranha, piranha? well, if you've never seen anything to do with venezuela, there's a lot of travelogue footage of both caracas and the countryside (and jungle-side), and of the various native peoples at work and play, as well as plenty of indigenous wildlife. if you like william smith, he plays a bit of a git (as he has always been wont to do).and that's about it. if it wasn't for william smith, this could probably pass as a fund-raising film for save the children or some other organization that benefits the "third world". the only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits. no mutant killer fish like in roger corman's singly-named piranha. you'd figure with twice the fish in the title there would be twice as many monster fish preying on the characters, but alas, this is not the case.the story starts with a photojournalist and her brother coming to venezuela to do a story on one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation quickly changes to one of wanting to find diamonds, which are apparently fairly plentiful there.there's not a lot of real action or danger in this movie. what could've been an exciting motorcycle race is dulled by the mass of landscape and animal footage that is inserted in it to draw out the films running time. there's not a whole lot more action until the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie (which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the traveloguery).in my view, the only ways that a movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid. piranha, piranha certainly qualifies for that former badge, and is pretty damn close to the second. the only reason i won't rate it a "1" is that the added footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie.

i got seriously ripped off with this purchase. the other posters pretty well cover the failings of this poor poor film. my dvd that i purchased actually had the 1978 piranha poster art on the cover with the credits for that film on the front 'directed by joe dante', etc. i was really disappointed to find the wrong film on the disc. i am actually a fan of lots of bad movies. there is always something funny or at least amusing on most of them somewhere. not this film! i am actually going to spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar dvd just for the principle of the thing. blatant false packaging here. easily the worst movie of all time. no redeeming factors at all. boring!!!not even worth checking out just to see how bad it is. seriously.

obviously, this is not the "piranha" directed by joe dante and produced by roger corman. it wasn't so obvious, when i bought the dvd for only $2.95, as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy/horror "piranha", even the dvd menu (no features of course) matched the cover. half way through watching this odd movie, my girlfriend and i started thinking, where are the piranhas? once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer, which had completely different footage, the blurb on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. instead, we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter. this tame, exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old-school, camp value. strange that a dvd can be manufactured with the wrong film in tact, but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b-grade movies of the same name made in the 70's. reading other posts made on this film, i noticed that i'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd. how could this be an international error? is there perhaps, some sort of dvd phenomena where unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds? what is going on???

warning:i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.if you plan on watching this movie don't! i warn you... this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying, not in the horror movie kind of way, to watch. i mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway. i wish i wouldn't have. this movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that i couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent. for one thing, this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of piranha. they only show piranhas once! at the same time, the way this film sounds so poorly heard, i got sleepy only 20 minutes into the thing. at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i stared gloomily at the blank tv screen. it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain dysfunction after watching it...

"two wildlife photographers are traveling through the amazon river basin on their latest assignment. while trying to capture the wildlife of the area on film, our photographers cross paths with a game hunter, who is stalking the animals for another reason. looking to eliminate the witnesses to his illegal activities, the hunter decides to" according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. handsome guide peter brown (as jim pendrake) takes pretty blonde ahna capri (as terry greene) and her good-looking brother tom simcox (as art greene) into the venezuelan jungle, to admire the view, and take wildlife pictures. after they hook up with hunky big-game hunter william smith (as caribe), psychological dramatics surface. a pivotal scene, with mr. brown reposing in the "vee" of a tree, and sharing a cigarette with mr. simcox, is nicely staged. the circular direction reappears in the later "fight" between brown and mr. smith; and, it is effective. simcox' early sex romp adds nothing to the story; it could have been cut, to take advantage of what seems like flirting between the brown and simcox characters. an attraction between brown and ms. capri could have been played up, also. the music, including jim stein's "love all things that love the sun", is fine; but the film needs to be re-tracked, to cut out animals which do not appear on screen. and, there is far too much superfluous footage on display. "piranha" is a case where less would have been more.

the movie is great for venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. only 1 piranha. nice scenery. the only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. the end when caribe drowns is a definite hollywood prop. there is no definite storyline. it goes from venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end. a very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of venezuela. william smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies. like all actors they all need to have at least one bad film don't waste the $5.00 on the dvd.

this is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. these people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. there really are no piranhas, but i guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. there is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. toward the end, there's lots of action and a rape thrown in. somebody must pay, and they do. it would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to sort of fill the thing out. there were lots of monkeys. if you fast forward through the dull parts, you have a tight little five minutes.

i was duped as well. here i was expecting all sorts of man eating pirahnas and what the hell do you get.an hour and a half of nothing, but awkward silences with some weird guy, who isn't weird enough to be scary.i thought there was no way $5 could be too much for a movie.damn i was sooooo wrong. it was very hard to watch the whole thing.don't fool yourself. its not so good that its bad. its not even that kind of movie.its nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing.piece of crap!!!!!!!!

in 4 words, captain corelli's mandolin was "completely out of tune" with the book. the novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details. in ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advice to corelli and his eventual ironic demise), the story and characters fall flat.this was the first movie that i've ever walked out of midway through. interesting cinematography, great actors do not make a film; the story does.

i give it a 2, because of the beautiful mediterranean greece, otherwise it would be 1. when nicholas cage came into with his first lines, i thought he was just kidding. cage as an italian ?? i'm sorry, but very wrong actor who's acting is also bad, not to mention his italiano accent. the story is very loose, it might have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay. the camera is great, photography also but why the hell did you cast nicholas cage and penelope cruz for the role. please don't get me wrong, i don't have anything against cage, he has some really great movies, but he obviously isn't for every role. it's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set, because the story has potential.

i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, i still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. we have similar people in the united states and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. think of the puritans,and the christian crusades against the islamic people during the medieval times. lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion. i do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. but still do remember the majority of the islamic people are peaceful! people of any nation feel some sort of patriotism but to start a war on the fact that i'm right and your wrong needs to be rethought. again i repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them.

i actually was looking forward to this movie. after reading a number of reviews before the release, it sounded like a genuinely nice film, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (nicholas cage, penelope cruz and john hurt.)well, it might have been all of those things but it is so boring that i defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention. also, cage's attempt at speaking with an italian accent is embarrassingly bad. he's such a good actor that i cringed every time he spoke in this film. 'disappointing" seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film, and i totally agree.i guess it didn't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because, like cage's accent, it did not do well.

forget what i said about emeril. rachael ray is the most irritating personality on the food network and all of television. if you've never seen 30 minute meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. i really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. the problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot. if you love something or think it's "awesome" (a word she uses roughly 87 times per telecast) just say it. and she's constantly using horrible, unfunny catchphrases like "evoo" (extra virgin olive oil!). shut up! what's worse is ray has two other shows on the network! i think this is some elaborate conspiracy by the terrorists to drive us mad. give me more tyler florence! ray is lame.

i watched this cooking show for a few times before i wanted to pull my hair out. just one question.....who can't cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. also, almost every cooking show on tv is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for sandra lee), during their show. oh and yep....they do full meals too.love the comment by the guy who hated the "evoo" comment. add "de-lish" to my list of stupid tag words. then you have the obvious....a loud, gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience. she laughs at her own lame comments, mugs too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks. no she ain't "the cutest thing." she's a 40-something year old woman who isn't de-lish.

1st watched 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10(dir-mario pinzauti): silly, sex-filled master & slave having too many intimate relations movie. this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex. laughable dubbing of the original italian language in the version i watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti-slave statement(or should i say one line). what a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash.

italian rip off of mandingo and the drum is a badly dubbed italian life on the plantation yarn. lots of people who don't look like they belong in the american south wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the american south. the plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows. the film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it, its all tease. its all probably racially insensitive, i couldn't notice since its artistically bankrupt. the final twist is at best laughable. a major turkey.

trading on the success of the 1975 hit, this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where massa gets down with the slave women, and the missus gets down with the big black stud, and with massa'a son also. in fact, there is so much getting down going on, that i really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed.so, if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves, or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes, then this one is for you.there is a funny/sad story in here, but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation.

the italians are undeniable masters in the questionable "art" of ripping off and imitating movies. what they do is take an innovative, money-making and foreign concept, maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action, sleaze and political incorrectness. but what to do when the non-italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? well then, i guess, you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie! this italian turkey was inspired by richard fleischer's successful slavery-saga "mandingo", released one year earlier, but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title, you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth, character drawings, unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships. "mandinga" is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes, in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already. the characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards, which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in south america. the elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of "moustache-of-the-year" awards) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him. his mistress, who if i understood correctly is also his cousin (?), is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves. when the plantation owner's son returns from europe, after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time, the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last. the handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves, supposedly to "demonstrate" how their masters do it) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. his romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger, and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever. hey  i just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes "mandinga" sound like an interesting film! well, it's not and i apologize if i raised anyone's anticipations. it's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through, but if the themes appeal to you, then definitely check out the aforementioned "mandingo". much rather than sick exploitation, that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film, with real actors, great music and impressive filming locations. "mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.

this was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere, got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced. there were so many ugly, mutton-chopped guys in this film, i lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers. i have a theory about the casting though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys/victims were played by beautiful actors. indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were gorgeous as was the innocent priest's daughter, while the plantation owner, his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. on purpose? you make the call.i hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well. if you just want to look at bare breasts, there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave/master fetish then you'll love this film. otherwise, watch it once, vomit, shower and never speak of it to anyone.

when i first looked at the back of the cover of this film, it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes. and it certainly was memorable. puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible. how it was possible that it was released on dvd at all. out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night...we might just have picked the worst. and yes, they had tomb raider. absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly. who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character? out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with, this is now my favourite. the character foggerty, the village idiot, played by nickolas grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color. if there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year, please let it be puckoon, cause i don't think it can be any worse. i still wonder if this just might have been the worst way i have spent my money, and take my word for that i have made many lousy purchases over the years.

technically, this movie would have had it all: decent actors, a nice landscape, no obvious sights of a lack of budget, a celebrity like richard attenborough. the plot summary also sounded promising, suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people outwitting it.however, it never delivers. the plot is simply too illogical. throughout the whole movie, not one person does a single sensible thing. mad politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers - all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next. what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene.of course, this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated. however, it's also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle. actually, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who doesn't seem to have a clue about what's happening to him, and the "writer", who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year olds.what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time, but didn't made me laugh once. i've seen several bad "funny" movies, but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense, "puckoon" is really remarkable.if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, check out "brazil". don't waste your time on "puckoon".

spike milligan was one of the funniest men i've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life.this movie is limp and awful, and does his memory no credit. the script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact (the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). the actors' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great cast wasted, and the lead, sean hughes, delivers milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely.the gentle pacing is a killer as well. farce should accelerate towards the end. the goon shows often did, the novel "puckoon" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax.milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of "puckoon" in 1980, with t.p. mckenna, dermot kelly, norma ronald and jack hobbs. now, that's funny. ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. i believe the lp was transferred to cd, but don't know if it's still in print.there is a movie of "adolf hitler: my part in his downfall" with jim dale and arthur lowe. it too is a godawful mess, but it's funnier than this thing.it's possible that milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. the other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. this film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.

okay, now i am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that zazu pitts is satan is not without some basis. let me explain. the film at first appears to be a dandy b-movie about an evil organization called "the crooked circle" and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. while this is very odd (especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes) and could have been interesting, this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors. why? well because zazu pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining just like olive oyl with a bad toothache!! while murders are being committed, people are being kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on zazu whining at full volume--almost like someone's obnoxious 3 year-old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! at the same time, she's not an integral part of the film but received top billing. why she is even there is beyond me--i assume it's just to whine and yell. as a result, i found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined. now you probably know why i referred to this actress of dubious talent as "satan"! i'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product, they, too, felt pretty much the same way i did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance.this film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet. i can see why.

even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and i abhor them ---would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film. perhaps inspired by "101 dalmatians" with its smart and loyal dogs, its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly "happy" and predictable ending, the alternate title "101 turkeys" springs to mind. that would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production. i dismissed it as some inane hollywood perversion of british customs before learning, to my horror, that it actually is a canadian film, done in victoria bc, that phony british theme park of a town, while sucking tax dollars out of ottawa on, that equally phony pit of canadian mediocrity. let me count the ways it is bad. the dizzy plot? the asinine script? the dismal performances and sophomoric direction? the cloyingly clever animals? the endless clichés and predictable slapstick? on second thought, neither i nor those browsing the imdb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings. yet were i to detail its merits, this space would remain blank. trust me, it is bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (canadian) cinema. if you have seen it already, my condolences. if you have not, stay away from it as you would sars or bubonic plague. or other movies with cute animals. don't even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed, fabricated and filmed this frightful folly. perhaps tonight, when i retire, i will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as i flee in frantic flight. i hope so. it will be a far far better thing i do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle. but then, i might dream that i had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night, trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream. i might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. maybe "godzilla" or "attack of the killer tomatoes" perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner.

i don't usually like to comment on the acting in a movie, because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after. in this movie, i will make an exception. the acting in this film are below average all around. i mean halfway into the film, i wonder how the hell did the producer and/or the director gets around casting such an ensemble of people who can't act. even-though the production value was good, the ill written story just compounded on top of the bad performance of the actors, and there is even a half-hearted attempts to a twist to the ending of the movie, which ends up quite confusing. is all the spanish horror films this disappointing?

this week's surprise screening at gv turned out to be the horror movie the nun (la monja). seriously, i think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like the monk, the priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.the basic premise goes very simply, that a ghoul dressed up in a nun garb (so that it can lay claim to the title) goes around killing ex-convent girls. there seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved, as the daughter of one of the victims, eva (played by an eye candy icelandic anita briem), goes on to discover, with the help of a few good friends, like a rip off of i know what you did last summer (mentioned also, by the way).so as the body count increases, it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred (aren't they always?) heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. delving into the sins of the mothers, the movie did the unthinkable, that with a dream sequence as the introduction. i hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly, and there are a couple of them in the movie.in part, the movie played at times like ju-on gone wrong with the plenty of dark water references, and they could have retitled this unholy water, for the circumstances and plot points in the movie. however, there are plot holes abound, so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply. you'd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun, and sets which look like they can rival recent thai horror movie dorm.the acting's pretty forgettable, with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented english. and since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witch-hunt. what gives? hello, got hantu, still got mood ah? then again, the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated/sfx which has a built in ai of popping up every now and then, in various fashion, just to elicit screams from timid audiences. the characters also break every unwritten rule in the do-nots in horror lore, so you know and expect their just desserts.can you possibly enjoy this movie? sure you can. just ensure that you're watching it in a full house (should be easy, since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific), and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every "frightening" scene. it's pretty fun, and adds to the atmosphere, besides what's going on the screen. surround sound doesn't even come close.think of it as watching an episode of scooby doo without the wisecracks, and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a pg rating. those could possibly have been the best bits, now left rotting on the censor's floor board.

this is a stereotype plot. a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.the fights are not of high standards. they are way too "simple" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. the fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. the coach yells do this and do that with no success. and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. this results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. think about the rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. the fights are also shot poorly.there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment.these guys really could have made some quality entertainment, but the director wasn't up to the task. or the other crew in my opinion. maybe they had a small budget, i don't know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.

this movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book. as written by rafael sabatini, this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the caribbean, and it would have made a grand motion . also, it would have been very simple to make. all the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island. unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. even the name of the main character was changed, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel. it's a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story.

i attended a screening of 'the cooler' at the toronto film festival this year. while the other reviews i've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, i must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. the very brave and candid performances by william h. macy and maria bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clichéd script to have received the green light in years. i don't know how bad the brown bunny was, but i'm certain it couldn't have attained the dante-style depths that this one did. as courageous as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to entrust themselves to such a dreadful director and abysmal screenplay.he must pitch pretty well in the boardroom, because he should never been permitted to be within a hundred yards of a camera. the dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that i actually found myself blushing during the screening. i am mortified that the talents of macy have been totally squandered in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing.watching gifted actors like alec baldwin labor through kramer's appalling script and ham-fisted direction was akin to watching a baby seal get clubbed to death - i felt angered, helpless, and sickened all at the same time. although i am always glad that there are investors and industry-people willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises, this picture was a total, utter fiasco. kramer couldn't have been crueler to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe to their knees. i hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening. regrettably, it seems that the bad luck of main character has rubbed off on the picture in the worst possible way. anyone accustomed to quality independents will likely find it completely unbearable.

"the duke" is a film based in the heart of the british aristocracy where an old duke (john neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (oliver muirhead and sophie heyman); he passes his dukeship down to his dog. the dog's "best friend", an american girl named charlotte (played by courtnee draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former duke due to him being her great uncle. a young chef named florian arrives, with him and charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way, acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of hubert, the 'duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. all this is watched over by james doohan who plays a butler who is determined to try and serve his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master, hubert. doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. a fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor.though from the technical viewpoint, i dislike this film as i only watched upon discovering james doohan's role. though the plot is good, elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. ignoring the absurdity of a "doggie duke", i personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. the dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. the director, phillip spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. plus, the acting of muirhead and heyman, whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences, fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role.but, as a mature movie fan, i find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. i can admit i found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched, but has definite connections. i do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but i do highly recommend it to dog lovers, families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and james doohan fans who wish to see 'scotty' in his final role.

admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero (bond) and villain (blofeld) were seriously miscast. lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play bond. he looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. the director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like "royal baluga, north of the ..." just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster. the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father. but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with lazenby only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor. this movie is too long (140 mins.) for a bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until bond's mountain escape, where it begins to pick up. this film tries very hard, but falls short. many bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch, but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one.

a woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. she's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. we also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse. further, even though this is a business arrangement, the first time she's with her sperm donor, she takes off all her clothes, as if it's a seduction. plus, her husband doesn't notice when $30,000 goes missing from their bank accounts. does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most hollywood fare? far fetched on all counts.

i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. apart from his rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. but surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit. the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes."l'étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, ray neglects to say so. i was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in french) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('si belle, cybele') and some portmanteaux.as so often in ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. i'll rate this mess one point out of 10.

i looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. but the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. there is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. i was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!there's only one good thing about this movie. the sound!! the soundtrack is awesome! .............don't expect anything from this movie.

this noisy, dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except william h. macy, who could have tackled the role played by mr. stone, the team doctors, or the "fruitcake" selling cereal. if you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some mtv-styled music video scenes.** any given sunday (12/16/99) oliver stone ~ al pacino, cameron diaz, jamie foxx, dennis quaid

another lame attempt to make a movie "gritty" and "thought provoking"- whatever the hell that means. they have al pacino say a lot of words like - "television killed football." yeah whatever. this is another movie that showcases oliver stone's delusions of grandeur. if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs? he even throws cameron diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. it's a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad.ever since "scent of woman," writers and directors have used pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. his characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite. he needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling. he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "organized football is messed up," and act out a good story.

i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. the acting was over the top. the direction was tacky and amateurish. the script was just a joke. the story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. and why, why did oliver stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? he was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. he could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. then you have jamie foxx, who throws like a girl. but, he is a tad more athletic than the aged dennis quaid. seriously, stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with add. that is why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and numerous edits. it just became a bad mtv video. shame on al pacino for doing this crap. cameron diaz? heck, that no-talent takes any role that comes down the pike. when lawrence taylor is the best "actor" you got going, well, your movie sucks! and this one does.

i had the misfortune of seeing this crapulous effort on television a few years ago. suffice it to say michael gross phones in his performance, and hasselhoff is the least convincing thief/psycho...ever! if you have a couple of hours to kill, watch it and prepare to laugh.

i just got back from "ags". after seeing it, i'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, stone never has watched an nfl game in his life. great cinematography ? give me a break. the game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. was there anything in this movie that wasn't brought up in "north dallas forty" ?aging star player ... check. young hot shot .... check. painkillers .... check. owner who doesn't "get it" .... check. crazy off-field behavior .... checkalso, it's the playoffs in dallas (i.e dec or jan) in an outdoor stadium, yet people sitting there in tank-tops and shorts ! and what was with those lights ? were they playing in a japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium ?and the strategy shown in the game was laughable. it's fourth & 1 inside the "sharks'" 30. dallas leads 35-31. kick the frigging field goal. not only would this had made sense football-wise, but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two-point conversion. hell, tie the game w/ the extra point and stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime.were the lame montages of "old time" football players supposed to be a tribute to the game ? give me a break.and the script ... ugh. more cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there's another one."slapshot" was better than this movie. by far.1/10.skips this at all costs.

beautiful images, propaganda and history as toy. the ingredients of this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. politicall shadows. jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical america. he is silhouette of a vision about life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of large part of north america. in film is only superman. the delicate contour of ideas are crushed. the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. and jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of american realities. the end,triumphal and fake, romance and heroic, is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom. and the war against "avatar" is another gray stain. for one who heard nothing about jefferson, movie is a good beginning. for the others - disillusion. it is like the precious silk of a tailor. but the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are only ordinary cloth. so, a sad experience. slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation. a film who must impressive. and the ash of a story who could be magnificent.

when i first watched this film, i thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. he gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. he is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and american dream-working class hero trash (which i'm not). i don't get it. how can this film get away with being so naf. that bit with the little boy being rescued, i mean, come on! you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire-guy wearing any goggles (i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you) and no breathing equipment (he'd have choked after 2 minutes!). this film was just bad, ok?why robert? whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????!!!!sorry if this is your favourite film.

the man who gave us splash, cocoon and parenthood gave us this incoherent muddle of cliched characters, poor plotting, you've-got-to-be-kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting? i guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then. he's allowed.

the basic plot is good and can be engaging. the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef (though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie). so, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. and the dialog?! what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? you get much greater realism from most cartoons! the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. and, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! if you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie--way in excess of what you'd expect to find. they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems. so, as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re-write and re-editing.

if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then backdraft is definitely the one.however, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then backdraft has some serious flaws. it doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.after two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? well i was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.a good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.

i loved this movie when i was a teenager. loved it. it hasn't grown up with me, though. maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'goddammit' a lot. the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that william baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime. robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching, but no one's really at the top of their game here, and the women folk get particularly short thrift. the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and hans zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favourites.

the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie, stand by me, a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn't like it. he lends me a movie called backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it, instead i hated this movie. i don't think i've hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. i couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: billy baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who's being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it's own. i just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters, two brothers. stephen "bull" mccaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. donald "shadow" rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .martin swayzak is an alderman on the city council. he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. however, swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.i just couldn't get into this movie, i don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. i loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick. i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, donald sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. i know ron was going for great quality, but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey. the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, i didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, i'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.2/10

the unfunniest so called comedy i've ever seennot a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dare twin townvegas i ;like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well english in the worst way (in recent years the english films have been awful all of them) ireland at least produced the commitments, scotland with braveheart and trainspotting 2 stand out great movies and wales had twin town, zulu, last days of dolwyn , torchwood, doctor who and under milk wood etcthe comedy is paint by numbers, the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunnyengland is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce. it's the old class system that destroys english films. the oxbridge graduates spewing endlessly clichéd scripts about working class people they've never lived with. it is pathetic. monty python wasn't funny, neither was anything from oxbridge.let guys like jonny vegas and peter kay, rob brydon, billy connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the british and english film industries will rise again what next prince edward to write a modern day oliver twist?

now i like johnny vegas which is a good start, i also enjoy toilet humoursuch as young ones and bottom etc. this however failed to bring even asmall smile to my face. the story follows johnny around after his wifechucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) as he attempts to shag anything that moves. failing normally. i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a wasteof my time altogether. unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother..... 

nothing special to see here, the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. this film has an original story, but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters, so in my opinion it's not worth seeing. i'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times. so if you are looking for something original see another thing.

oh sex lives of the potato men, what foul demon created thee? this is a film that you watch, smirk a little during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it, you just cannot help but smile as you talk. but it's not that sex lives of the potato men is actually a funny film and one that inspires you to smile when talking or thinking about it, it's just that the film is so bizarre; is so insulting and is no shameless in its attempt to get across a meek laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin. do bear in mind that what follows the smirk is a sinking of the head; a consequent shake of the head and a raise of the index finger and thumb to both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to reminisce about your time watching this trash.but that's what the film is, it's trash; it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none-the-less. whoever came up with this idea, put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must either be very brave or very desperate. it's strange to have a film that is most definitely 'about' something but one that does not have, under any sort of circumstance, a decisive narrative. this follows on from that idea that most of european cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open-ended and themes take precedence over most other things. in sex lives of the potato men, the same situation and technically the same joke are replayed over and over again and that is an ideation that consists of: 'sex is a very, very funny thing.' these ideas are perhaps more suited to an american film so it's no wonder that after a while watching this film, things start to feel a little out of sorts.the film begins and ends in the same manner, creating a feeling of a circular journey; a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. three blokes sit around a table talking and what-not. their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios each can possibly think of. the odd thing here, being that whenever one man says something nasty, the other grimaces but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not. the men are dave (vegas) and ferris (crook), two people joined by tolly (coleman) whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories. they are employed by jeremy (gattis), a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of humour rather than study.so what's the situation in sex lives of the potato men? the three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week. if the humour revolving around dave and ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then for jeremy things are just spooky. it all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in, that's when the jaws drop. the character of jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general merely look 'funny'. jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to ruth (davis), echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with hannibal lecter writing his letter's to clarice in 2001's hannibal. but whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when, later on, it is revealed the true origin of their relationship. suddenly, we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and distasteful. to say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film.quite sad how, in one of jeremy's letters, he writes about something-or-other exclaiming it to have "no artistic vision  just one big mess". i hate it when words said by the characters echo the film they're in. sex lives of the potato men does not explore someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible, it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously unfunny jokes and situations. rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down, it makes a daft joke out of it (tickets with numbers on!?); rather than get into the mindset of a fan of sadomasochism, the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he climaxes. ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss. it's a relief the film got to no audiences abroad. this is one section of british culture, indeed of the british mentality that i pray will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly.

sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that tweety bird happens to be on with his owner granny. oh i don't even have enough words to convey how much i disdain both the tweety and granny characters. they simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed. sylvester is a great character on his own, but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a granny. this animated short can be found on disc 4 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 and features an optional commentary by micheal barrier.my grade: d+

opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'kit for cat', 'tweety's s.o.s' fails to live up to that classic cartoon. instead, we get an example of friz freleng's tweety and sylvester series at its most generic. unlike chuck jones's road runner series, which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting, freleng's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'tweety's s.o.s', then, basically amounts to "this time let's put 'em on a boat". it's not an entirely weak cartoon. there are a few good jokes, mostly involving granny's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than tweety says "i tawt i taw a putty tat", a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns. 'tweety's s.o.s' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's definitely one to avoid.

i happened to catch this movie on late night tv. i saw the opening credits and thought this looks good. well i was very wrong. while not excruciatingly bad (it had some funny and tender moments)it lacked any sense of cohesion.it started off well enough with kathy bates'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. but kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think fried green tomatoes. the problem wasn't kathy, it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place. it was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next. the script also felt very contrived.some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release. the main reason i think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.having said all that i thought the small woman who played maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.

george sluizer's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema's most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time (shamelessly stolen by tarantino for kill bill volume two), but it has plenty more to offer than that. playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichés of standard 'lady vanishes' plots, it also offers superb characterisation and strong, underplayed but convincing performances.unfortunately, i can only assume that when it came to the remake, sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. his career never recovered from this disastrous misstep.chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie, latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from dok-tah e-ville. no banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "please. let. me. kill. you. thank you. for your. consideration.' but the blame really needs to be shared out here. none of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good  keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. not that they're given any help by either director or writer todd graff. the script is particularly weak. the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. as for the new and improved happy ending  standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 'let's end on a joke like a tv cop show' moment  best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.

skip this hollywood version, a real piece of garbage. a cheap insult to the brilliant original "spoorloos", or by the english title also called "the vanishing". it completely misses the mark in typical, grotesque hollywood fashion, usually due to a bunch of talentless, corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. much like the awful "the scarlet letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the macdonaldsland crowd, that it became an aberration, not even a bastardization, but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look, feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. except that movie at least had gary oldman, who is interesting to watch in anything he does. this dog has nothing going for it, even the usually very talented jeff bridges is an embarrassment. great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a dutch/french collaboration in 1988. that is a great film. this is a horrific mess.

when george sluizer was told he could direct an american version of the book "het gouden ei"/the movie "spoorloos"(outside holland, this movie has the name "the vanishing" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - he was told that 'the american audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. because i have already put this in the trivia section, i won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. if you want to know the original ending, watch "spoorloos" or read the book. this movie is absolute rubbish, and the first kiefer sutherland movie i don't like. watch the original dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.

the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. i did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. if there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. i seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings. a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a movie. it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen. total waste of time and money. the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way.with redundant sleep inducing dialogs and sets, this is the worst movie i have come across.

once upon a time theresa russell made a few halfway decent movies, so i keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). however, dark world is just the latest in a string of disappointments. the first 90 minutes are very hard to watch. the lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session (in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents, but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading). the sets and props seem "off" somehow (what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelved full of case file holders?). the screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and datelines, which appear with no rhyme or reason. now, if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening, they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are really clever clues to the plot turning topsy-turvy in this misfire's final five minutes. well, for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are tv: the movie and surfer, dude; they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement. but it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their life--and is not a close friend or relative of a dark world cast or crew member--could fall for such a lame canard. despite what the d.v.d. box might lead you to believe, this movie has about as much resemblance to sunset boulevard (dead narrator device) or hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) as a drained jim beam bottle refilled with urine has to booze!

this movie was produced by the biggest producer in costa rica. although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in costa rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an oscar nomination due to it's political relevance with oil (-he he, right) ...well, this is all a lie. this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos salazar herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like subject) and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the atlantic coast of costa rica with an american oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region, but at the end it never was approved by the government. now, it may have some nice footage about the beaches, but that's it; nothing bigger than that... it is all in the camera. most of the actors are lousy, except for two or three. the rest lack of sense of what acting means: they overact most of the time. the story is completely common and cliché, worthy of a cheap mexican soap opera as i said.. because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil, but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. the script is nothing impressing, it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought. it has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes... but besides that is pretty decent. the director did an alright job, i mean, he is not like an oliver stone,but he did his job with the resources he had handy. i would like to question him why instead of using costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones.. i mean after all they bragged about being an 100% costarican production... that's what you at least expect. final the end is is not well done, there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless. besides being the most elaborated movie in all costarican history, i think it's mediocre. you can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash. never heard of "pi"? anyway, if you are curious about costa rican or central american movies, this one will do, but you are definitively not missing anything.

watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review there.let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. this movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. i too, had liked russell and pare "back in the old days" and was very hopeful for them. in my netflix review, i mentioned that i lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. when i did return to the living room, i was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded. i even rewound it to make sure i was not missing anything. this film totally crapped out on how to do a "twist" ending. i suspect that the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that sets were really lacking. and yes, i suppose all those "bad sets" were an effort to give the viewer a clue. all it told me was "low budget."anyway, the reason i came here, was because over the weekend i saw a review of shutter island, and with what the reviewers were saying, or not saying, lead me to believe that shutter island is the same deal, only with a budget 50 to 60 times more! (actually i have no idea how much dark world cost, but i hope they didn't spend more than 1 million!)so, that being said, i kinda thought that if someone reworked the script a bit, got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether that meant a better scenic designer, or better post coloring, just someone with a vision,) they could remake dark world into a passable product. now it sounds like shutter island is doing that. looks like they got the vision right, but the scripting could still be off. money can't buy everything, but it should in hollywood!ps my 2 star rating is for russell and pare.

this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! the plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. more unrecoverable life time wasted!if you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once. but maybe you'll need an antidepressant instead!sometimes it's good if celluloid degrades.

i was hoping this would be a good weekly vehicle for tim curry, one of my all-time favorite performers. alas and alack, it is not. there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between anyone on the show, the dialogue is decidedly uninspired, and even the laugh track appeared to be laboring. brutal.

i rented this movie, because i noticed the cover in the video rental store. i saw nolte, connely, madsen, 40's time setting, and thought "hmm, can't be too bad." unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "not too good".its kind of a chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. but its a decent movie to see once i guess. and melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance.

william petersen (that c.s.i guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. his character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. he has a range that allows him to play just about anything. after his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. it leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. the movie itself is pretty poor. worth a watch on tmn or a pick up at the library but not much more. too much of it reminds you of l.a confidential except that where that movie starts to get complicated upon itself, this one is so loose, it steers everywhere but where it should. 2 out of 5 stars

i went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter, good cast, a director who had previously done the highly-rated "once were warriors" and my liking for noir-ish films set in l.a. in the forties and fifties. i would argue that i am reasonably easy to please in this film category; i appreciate the classics of the genre but i will sit through and enjoy a half-decent if derivative effort as well. however, i found this film completely unbearable.despite a good situation in which to place the story, nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two-hours plus of this sorry mess. good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing. the narrative is slack and drags unbearably, and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death. there is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and by the end i simply didn't care what happened because i did not believe in anything in the film.l.a. confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true-to-life, the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department. mulholland falls by contrast fails in every department, a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved. if they ever show this on a plane i will still walk out.

i saw this movie on the shelf at blockbuster and thought it looked cool. the dvd case touted so many great actors and i wondered to myself, "why have i never heard of this movie?" then i turned over the case and saw the director, lee tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. first of all i want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, i think i should explain why this movie is so terrible. okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters. this is the worst role i've ever seen chazz palminteri play and i'm surprised he would do something this ridiculous. however, under-appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money. palminteri plays a one dimensional police detective who comes off about as dumb as a c-movie mob henchman. him, along with the lead detective (the poorly directed nolte), the great but simple michael madsen, and the late chris penn (whose role along with madsen's was completely thrown away) make up an elite squad of la detectives tasked to rid the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s. the movie introduces this squad as cops who will break every law to make sure those who think they're above the law don't operate in their city. at the beginning of the film the cops rough up a local restaurant, grab an alleged mobster (william peterson) and take him to a place they call the mulholland falls. they toss him off one of the cliffs on mullholland drive and this is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about ridding the city of crime. whatever. this was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title that's designed to make you think of la and its famous sites. somewhere later on they find the dead body of jennifer connelly and the plot begins. on to the direction which was nothing short of amateur and weak! aside from the fact that the characters were b-movie quality, the overacting by those such as treat williams, the guy who plays the chief of police, and the awful daniel baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie seem like it was lee tamhori's first film. there's not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe melanie griffith, who some might argue was the worst in the movie (she won a razzie for this film). in the end, it was her character that was not that great and she really didn't have much to work with. as with any bad movie, it all begins with the writing, and this script was no gem. plot is formulated simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into consideration characters' motivations. the way the characters behaved was unbelievable. cops taking the law into their own hands is believable within the right circumstances (see la confidential) but in this case it looked like these guys could get away with anything, including murder, and never bat an eye about cleaning anything up. i guess we as an audience are just supposed to assume that no one saw anything and that people won't ask questions. everything about the story is predictable and is spoon fed so well that we understand everything that's going to happen a good while before the characters do. however, it doesn't make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there aren't any heroes in this movie. in the end, the best component of the movie was the great score by david grusin. from the beginning, it invoked a since of chinatown, which quickly faded when i realized how unbelievable just about everything in the film was. it didn't surprise me to learn that it made a whopping eleven million in the box office. what i will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs. nick nolte's acting is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard dog and i laughed every time he tried to be serious. i also nearly fell on the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the film (i think there are three with one during a key fight scene). when you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. so, even with my negative criticism, i will recommend this movie solely for the purpose of enticing laughter, that is, if you appreciate the good movies like la confidential.

the four la cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that nick nolte, the dumbest-looking of the lot, is in charge. the writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to wring articulacy out of the man-mountain nolte. foprget questioning anyone. nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp. his methods get him nowhere, until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut. he smashes up an fbi squad, and throws two military officers out of a plane in flight, with only a vague report of anger at hq and no punishment at all. at the end of the film he is as gormless and muscle-bound as he was at the outset. how he managed to get a beautiful whore to fall deeply in love with him is a mystery, as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his jobless wife. two interesting shots in the picture: one, of an atomic explosion, the other of a gigantic crater, ostensibly caused by a bomb. it's almost as wrecked and puffy as nolte's face.

a special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s los angeles. nick nolte plays max hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by michael madsen, chazz palminteri and chris penn. also starring are melanie griffith, jennifer connelly and john malkovich among others. quite an impressive list of names. unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.our story begins when young allison pond, played by connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development. our band of four detectives is called in and it is immediately obvious that nolte's max hoover is going to be taking a very personal interest in this case. we will soon find out that allison, in addition to knowing hoover quite well, was also involved with some rather important military and government types who may have had reason to want her dead. but who exactly was involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead? hoover and crew set out to find out. sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it goes nowhere.despite the impressive array of names, the acting here leaves much to be desired. nolte is overacting, madsen seems incredibly bored, palminteri and malkovich come off as caricatures, penn has hardly anything to do and griffith is dull as can be. by far the best performance is connelly's in all too fleeting flashback sequences. the dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. the sense of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is missing altogether. nothing dramatic really happens. in fact nothing at all seems to happen for the bulk of the picture. instead we just slog along towards a rather ludicrous and incredibly disappointing climax. when the "mystery" is solved you may find yourself saying, "oh come on now, is that all there is?" but it gets worse as after the mystery is solved we get a completely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable action sequence. and even then we are made to suffer further as another awful, badly acted, completely unnecessary scene is tacked on at the end. and then mercifully it is over. and not a moment too soon.

if this is film noir, then noir must be french for glacially slow. take a cast of completely unlikeable characters, give them nothing to say, punctuate the whole thing with gratuitous ultra-violence, and you've got the formula for an aggravated dash. could be subtitled "sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from chinatown rip-off". bruce dern's one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick. by the way, i didn't like the film.

i have just seen caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual vistas film festival held here in dallas, and i must express my discontent. the opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of south american countries (costa rica, in this particular case) by north american oil companies, and the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. the main characters are a married couple who live a simple, pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. right away, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half-sister. i'm not going to go into specifics about this (and to be honest, i don't feel that i'm spoiling anything with this review), yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy. so, the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place, trying to preserve his livelihood. on one hand, the reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself). on the other hand, he is faced with being dead broke, but on the side of his community, protesting the drilling. given the length of this film, it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described, but it just doesn't happen, and i'll tell you why. you will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far, one for direction and an audience award. i'm not going to pick apart esteban's direction, it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything. the audience award was at a film festival in spain, and for it to gain an audience award, i'd have to imagine that spanish people just dig soap operas. in fact, central and south america dig soap operas as well, i know that much. i assume that esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that is what unfolds over the course of this film, so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side, almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome, because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. the only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. it's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. from time to time, they toy with the oil against community plot, but these are digressions at best. what we see a lot more of are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. these themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary. it's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance. nevertheless, the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself, resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for, or if there was ever anything to begin with. here are two things that i think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. it's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. or, perhaps if caribe had been an hour longer, they could have worked this all out. regardless, i'd have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and i think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. caribe is both and neither. these two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with, both sides suffer. best of all, the romance plot is never even resolved. i'd like to say i'd watch this movie again to see what i've missed, but i have a strong feeling that i already know what it is. as far as i'm concerned, it wouldn't matter if i saw caribe ten more times. i've missed it because it is simply not there.

this movie is very modern and forward. it is about 75% in english. it is aimed at english-speaking multiplex-going young audience. basic plot is similar to ddlj. acting is below average.unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. the director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. all through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding. the heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable.the less that is said about failure of uday chopra doing shahrukh khan's ddlj role of arrogant girl-chaser, the better. the movie is about equality of sexes. but equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead about doing the right to do the right thing. if men have been shown as chronic casanovas in movies, does not mean women should also portray same behaviour.even though the movie is made in light-hearted fun spirit, it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward, that "fun" part of the movie makes no impact. not even in canada women dress like this, or guys behave like they have shown in the movie. it is certainly not a reflection of indian society or even canadian society. perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating, "all characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." the only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hrs, thank god.

this movie is not worth anything. i mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to hollywood movies! this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name. neal n nikki seriously sucked! never watch this movie. as for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. tanisha couldn't have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (all of that halla re was amazingly stupid) the songs are eh, and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... bottom line, i hated the movie. do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! buy the cd, if you must. (as i said, the songs are eh.) at least it is better then the movie.

oh my god, why, did i waste my precious time on this film? it is pathetic, waaaay ott and unrealistic, and one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life. yes, my life. i am embarrassed for yash raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.this is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie i have ever seen by yash raj films. i cringe for them, i really do. along with the terrible acting (or no acting, for that matter) by uday chopra, combined with the lack of talent of the "look at my boobs" tanisha, neal 'n' nikki has not one good thing about it at all. even the music is not upto the standard left by yrf. the director, arjun sablok, did an embarrassingly bad job here.honestly, i expected more. much, much more.

i did have some expectations from this film because 1. it was a yash raj production 2. when the songs were first shown on tv, they seemed catchy 3. the star(??!) cast was new. well, i must tell u that i just couldn't sit through this movie. uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. i won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that). 'cleavage queen' tanisha with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration. i think uday was slightly more tolerable than her! she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister. the story is pathetic...the same old tried and tested formula. absolutely no originality. there is nothing worth watching in this movie. makes me wonder why it was made in the first place!

i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. in fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. i actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how canadian indian second generations feel about sex. at any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a korean movie, yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? that korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking. i mean most of the neal n nikki hotel/drunk segment was emulated take by take. can't bollywood movie makers try to make originals only, please? seriously, i never enjoyed a hindi flick that is a copycat. the ones i enjoy have always spoken indian feelings through indian cultural means.

i'd give this film a 1/10. this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current "skin trend" in bollywood movies. i'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. what really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like yash chopra films ever succumb to such an awful production? they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than "adult" audience too, which when exposed to these sort of gross movies,may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition.on the whole, films must not only be entertaining, but also must comprise of some sense as well. certainly, this film is an immense disappointment to yash chopra fans, especially me myself. i am really disappointed over the plot, acting and everything else. why can't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films, at least for once throughout the film? the point is clear. i'd like to put my opinion in short: "horrible - disappointment - lot of adult material - lack of sensible "substance" - lack of normal psyche - worthless - could grab a cornetto or a temptations chocolate instead"

neal n nikki is voted on of the worst films of the year by planetbollywood. its hard to believe the famous chopra's have produced this lousy movie. it was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. the title song is the most annoying song of the decade, i'm the neil, i'm the man, rock star superstar. uday chopra is one of bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent. after making many super flops, and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his family. he gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death. tanisha, who is and will always be known for being kajol's sister, gives a dreadful performance. both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. it has a special appearance by the very cute richa pollad, in a pathetic role. the ending was so daft and stupid, i cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap.

yash raj films are so funny, whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house?seeing bhatt films working they copied the formula, bikini and everything plus casting low actors like uday and tanishaathe film is so horrible it makes you cringethe jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them uday resembles a gay plus a monkeytanishaa resembles an idiot the director thinks we all are idiots arjun sablok takes the audience for granted music is saving grace camera-work is gooduday chopra hams like an idiot, tanishaa looks like kajol in k3g if kajol was annoying der then tanishaa is worse the rest are okay

it is definitely not worth spending either money or time. it is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love. but this is with a western touch. but it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch. never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love. there is no depth to either of their characters. probably, with a better cast, some justice could have been brought about to the characters. finally, it is a movie with no fun, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy , no action, no thrill, no romance (i associate romance to something more passionate). definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family. overall, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. i shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie.

this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that perrugorria have done. it looks like a commercial from beginning to end. the ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod, it doesn't have pace, rhythm. it's illogical. what a mess. you can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes, and the ending...wow------spoiler-------jesus christ, how the hell perrugorria got shot? are you serious? worst scene of someone getting shot ever!------end of spoiler-----bad directing, bad script, bad acting...really bad overall. i wouldn't recommend this movie at all. it's a waste of money and time.

mansfield park, in its second half, is my favorite of austen's novels, and fanny price my favorite of her heroines, so i'm saddened by the unhappy fate she's suffered in her big- and small-screen representations. the only good reading of the character i've heard was done for radio by amanda root, who gave it the same quality as she did the character anne in the film of "persuasion": a stern, sure, heartfelt moral centeredness. if the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well; but the fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled, respectively: mary crawford; ruby the scullery girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial serving wench, or possibly tart, with her high moral principles pulled down a peg.well, i had hoped for better, but had feared worse. the serial had a solid edmund, in an actor who was best at likable saps, and the perfect, i.e. perfectly abominable, mrs. norris; otherwise it was dullish. the film, which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came off as a mixed-up burlesque. after such disappointments, and the more recent disappointments of this production's sister pieces (the new "persuasion" and "northanger abbey"), i couldn't help but have mixed expectations for this one; and on the whole, it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not. it condensed the novel intelligently, and in the end left me with much the same feeling, as a comic-book version might. on the other hand, to do so it had to rework most of the characters, except the crawfords, and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including its most famous character and what should be, if it isn't, its most famous scene.the character is the officious aunt norris, always ready to direct other people in what to do, but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself; here one gets no sense of that at all. and with her goes much else: her remark that cuts through fanny, "...considering who and what you are"; sir thomas's discovery that she has forbidden fanny a fire in her room all these years, and his roundabout apology for her; fanny's honesty in acknowledging, during a visit home, that aunt norris, for all her faults, could manage the household better than either of her sisters. but then, that entire trip is missing from the story, and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits sir thomas on his return; and in fact sir thomas himself, and his wife, are different from what they were. above all, the scene in which crawford proposes to fanny, one of austen's most complex, is simplified to a bare telling; missing from it is fanny's staunch upholding of what she knows to be right, and what she knows to be very probably true, against all the distractions crawford and anybody else can throw at her. to a male reader, now no less than when it was written, it reveals with unmatched clarity--unmatched, at any rate, as far as i know--what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust. it's a brilliant scene, in the novel; on tv it's just a scene.and, fanny, oh, fanny: when will we see your like?

is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscast age-wise? jemma redgrave, although a superior actress, seems as if she should be joining her children instead of nodding off on the couch. (i would have loved to see brenda blethlyn in the part, her connection to the latest pride and prejudice notwithstanding.)blake ritson and rory kinnear were the only two whom i felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance. every else looked confused or out of place. luckily, i'm not very familiar with dr. who (i've only seen a few episodes so far) or it would have definitely soured this further. too bad mansfield park has not yet seen its due on screen (either large or small). this novel requires the talent of a robert altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully.

rozema's 1999 adaptation of mansfield park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film. the 1999 film is reviled by many austen purists, but i admire the job rozema did in making mansfield park her own. it may not be strictly jane austen's mansfield park, but at least it was well-written, beautifully shot, and well-acted by a superior cast. i don't see how austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from itv (and rebroadcast on masterpiece theatre/pbs). the screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot, the production values are lackluster, and the cast (apart from jemma redgrave and blake ritson) are largely guilty of bad acting. i can't think of a worst miscast than billie piper as fanny price. her look was all wrong (bleached hair and dark brows??) and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material. sir thomas looked constipated the whole time. michelle ryan as mariah was on autopilot, as were the actors who portrayed the crawfords (when i think how superior alessandro nivola and embeth davidtz were in the '99 version, i just kinda shake my head).i haven't seen the 1983 version, so i can't comment on it, but i'd advise anyone who's curious to give the '99 version a chance. read the novel before or after and make up your own mind.

for a teenager who has never read austen, this adaptation might be fine. but only for them. this is a disjointed "cliff notes" version of mansfield park, and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching.why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book? the one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient.here we have billie piper who looks like a pretty country wench. she has a charming personality that develops nicely - but she has flagrantly died blonde hair, with black eyebrows and - through much of the pic - dark brown roots. so much for unspoiled cousin. it is incredibly distracting, and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair, rumpled clothing genre that shows a real disrespect for period accuracy.one thing is good here - haley atwell is the best mary crawford of all the versions. she is note perfect, flirtatious without being at all modern or suggestive, flippant and completely without any moral or ethical compass. henry here is actually good looking enough to be a slight temptation for our heroine.jemma redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her actually boring until her last scene - much too sensible. this is just a production that really missed the mark, a real low for austen fans.the only serviceable version is the one with odd duck (perfect for the role) sylvestra la touzel (despite the very very gay henry crawford - he's just laughable).

mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere, at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. a pick-up truck pulls up & an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe (claudia christian) out & leaves her there, but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of nestor duvalier (brion james) watches her from a short distance. virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print, thigh high, high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness. nestor then rips her top open, turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards. virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix (art evans) & the lapd baffled, or at least that's the message a local tv news reporter named clay dwyer (mark thomas miller) is telling his viewers. clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice (mary beth mcdonough) & therefore his mother emily (jeanne bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing nestor. unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes, nestor then turns into a monster again & bites emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself. nestor takes emily out to train her, they find a suitable homeless bum (rory vansaint), murder him & eat his guts but emily's son clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!edited, written & directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film. looking at some of the other comments on the imdb & the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror. well i can tell you now that i didn't see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren't any, unless they are very subtle. the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents, that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the predictable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. there are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills (stella stevens)), slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? wrong, mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting emily, showing her how to hunt for food & clay finding out. until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace, had some ok special make-up effects & had me interested, unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emily's son, the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his mother & the fact that she's a flesh-eating monster. this part of the film is incredibly slow, boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role-reversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her, telling her off & putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins & ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped. technically mom is bland & cheap looking, although i can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time. the special make-up effect's on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes, blink & you'll miss them. don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was, the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. there isn't much gore either, a severed arm, some brief intestine eating, a burnt body & a drill in someone's arm is all we get. the acting is ok but please mr. brion james what is that dodgy accent all about!? at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings, everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night (1985) but you may recognise him from die hard 2 (1990), he made mom & die hard 2 in the same year?! talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film & it certainly isn't a comedy as far as i'm concerned. very poor, very disappointing & yet again i've been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. definitely one to avoid.

lame b-horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her. when said lodger is killed off, mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authorities.my main complaint is that this film should have brought the funny. it failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the b-movie crowd happy. i've seen worse but i wouldn't give this one a rec--4.5/10.

very dull, laborious adaptation of amis's amusing satire. the hero is portrayed not as a likeable loser but a merely oafish cretin. most of the rest are pure caricatures with only helen mccrory putting in real quality and providing something of the novel's wit. the period setting is camped up as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war period of horror comics and rock'n' roll. a real dud even by the standards of bad uk tv.

in this silly symphony, a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city. most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table. the animation is fine, where this short suffers is in a lack of humor. perhaps i've just seen this "dinner table adventure" in one too many tom and jerry shorts. even though this came first, i just didn't find it that enjoyable.

this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going, but never really did. it was simply boring to watch, so much in fact i could just never really get into it. this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination, the cover of the videotape made it out to be one. instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting. of course, it does not help this movie at all. mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the 1970's called "the deep". bunch of looking for treasure, rival groups that sort of thing. there are supernatural twists in it too, but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were. i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead, or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcio's "zombie" movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie. that day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover art.

***minor plot spoilers***i must confess to having a soft spot for wayne crawford. i know little about him, but he appears to have masses of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent. in his films he usually performs multi-tasks - perm any 3 from lead male, director, producer and script-writer - tackling story lines from the sub-basement. despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the non-discerning.'the evil below' features crawford as a down-on-his-luck captain of a ramshackle charter boat, a bit like bogart in 'to have & have not' - the similarities between the films ends here though.the story begins with an underwater scene with two divers searching a wreck, before being attacked by an unseen creature - bit like the start of 'jaws 2'. the wreck turns out to be that of the 'el diablo', which went down centuries earlier. the ship was manned by heretic priests on the run from spain, with a cargo of stolen church treasure. this allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with lucifer and the armageddon both getting a look in. the films title refers to this sunken devil-ship, rather than any malevolent sea-creature.whatever faults the film has (and there are many) it is fun to watch and competently made. you can't help but like a film which, in the final 5 minutes, copies the famous beach scene in 'from here to eternity' and the final line from 'casablanca'.

max cash a charter boat captain who works off the caribbean island san sebastian is hired by sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, el diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. but something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.i have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'the deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. the story is a tame muddle (so many inconsistent angles don't make a lick of sense and encourages a blotchy pace) and the technical side is clunky. nice exotic location and under-water photography though. while the carefree performances weren't too bad either. a gruff wayne crawford is enjoyably witty and june chadwick is fair along side him. sheri able is pretty much eye candy. there are some bizarre developments that amuse and one or two eerie sequences. however there's a real lack of cohesion. most of the cutaway deaths happen off-screen, except for the bloody, fitful opening kills done by something unseen. again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. the music is generic with its thumping cues to warn us of approaching danger and the pov shots get a good working out. tatty, but watchable.

the evil below starts on 'the straits of san sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the el diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. jump to 'the straits of san sebastian present day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the el diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. captain max cash (wayne crawford) owns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'vagrant viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands. sarah livingstone (june chadwick) is an art teacher who dives for treasure as a hobby (well we all have to do something to pass the time right?), she hires max & his scantily clad assistant tracy (sheri able) so she can try to locate the el diablo & get rich. talk of sunken treasure excites some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community, as they dodge the criminals & thugs it is brought to max & sarah's attention that the el diablo has a sinister past, a past that supposedly still leaves it's supernatural legacy behind even now...directed by jean-claude dubois, according to the imdb with a little help from star crawford although the version i saw only listed dubois, i thought the evil below had some potential & is a bit different but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. the script by arthur payne starts off ok with the two divers being killed by some sort of sea creature but this opening is never referred to again, the creature is never seen again & there are no more supernatural killings. the evil below then suffers from a serious & terminal case of identity crisis, it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be as it chucks bits & pieces of various genres in there from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery & religious nonsense as well. as a result the evil below feels very bitty, fragmented & since the best scene in the entire film is the opening sequence i found myself sat there becoming more & more frustrated at the lack of any consistent horror as it went downhill rapidly & the fact we never see the sea creature thing again. the evil below is dull, slow, uneventful, predictable, silly & lacks any sort of charm or intelligence, in short the evil below doesn't do anything right that a good film should.director dubois fails to liven things up although he obviously shot plenty of underwater wildlife material as at times i thought i was watching a national geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, coral & the wildlife in general. forget about any gore, some blood stained water & blood coughing is about as gory as it gets i'm afraid.technically the evil below is very basic, it's bland & totally forgettable apart from nice underwater photography of fish. this is point & shoot stuff & as a whole the production values are very low, even the place where this was shot doesn't look very sunny or appealing. the acting is poor, but then again did you expect anything else?the evil below is a poor film, it's basic story is all over the place & it can't decide what it wants to be & as a result it ends up being a mess. add that to the low production values, the fact there's no gore here & absolutely minimal horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate & even then surely there are better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life...

the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. it starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.the evil below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads. there's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do. i manged to sit through it all (just about) but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover, but it's best left at that.

this is probably the most uninvolving film i've ever seen. i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon (everything else besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for wasabi) and jean reno. it's a testament to just how bad this film is that reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors (admittedly he's just starting out here) can't make this film, or the moments in which he is on screen, watchable.it's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. and, predictably, none of it is entertaining.it's not a "french mad max" as some people have claimed (actually, i think they mean "mad max 2") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. mad max 2 was pulsating, mad max 2 was exciting, mad max 2 was worth your time - le dernier combat is none of these.i know it's supposed to be cool to like arty black-and-white french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why i wouldn't trust anyone who claims to like le dernier combat, because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it asks for so much and gives nothing back. i found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. anyone who can sit through it undistracted isn't human, or, at the very most, is psychotic. (actually, they're probably just trying to seem "cool").

every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense, anticipation and allure to the plot. this story falls completely flat in this area. there is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters, and so suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no allure at all.the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, i was quite surprised. during the movie, i expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.while i'm a fan of both actors, i do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or, perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries. the writing was very weak, which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly, the script could have used some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf.(sorry diane ladd and richard gere).

this movie is the final straw. as two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy, this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since love actually. there was nothing good about the film whatsoever. it was an affront to love, death and everything in between. including horses and beaches. there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. this movie took the spark out of nicholas sparks. diane lane cannot act to save her life. she was unconvincing in her laugh, cry, and dance. and she needs a better haircut. there is no reason to watch this movie. save yourself. the romantic comedy is officially dead.

we thought this was one of the worst movies ever. i had to volunteer to watch the end. the romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the adams family goes on vacation...just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and the outerbanks does not look typically like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. also..it was not realistic. hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatches.also the friend was superfluous; and did not match the story what did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway? i also have to mention the wardrobe...did d. lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/shawl on in every scene? it was overdone. she looked good enough to not have to hide things; without making them obvious like with light slacks.lastly i am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid, and i mean stupid movie!!!! don't fall for the hype on this one!!!!!! we did. not even watchable.

*warning: 1 tiny inconsequential spoiler* you're right. this was no bridges of madison county. as soon as the lonely woman and richard gere checked into the big empty hotel, it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen. the question is: how will it come about? the answer is some stupid connect-the-dots story not worth sitting through. in one supposed bonding experience, they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans.(that was my spoiler.) and the next day they put them back. lol it wasn't compelling at all. i'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with richard gere. lol . . . it did have that advantage. you walk away and go, oh brother . . . even i could have written something more believable than that. i guess my life isn't quite as dull as i thought it was if i can scoff at a romance with richard gere. lol! and that friend inherited that totally contemporary, probably computer-generated mansion, resting half in the ocean, from her grandmother who built it after the civil war??? maybe her grandmother is oprah and this was way after the civil war? and yes, where was the email? what alternative universe do these people live in? i never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email, and facebook,and texting. and ok, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone, but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first.

not quite a bomb? the only thing missing was the enriched uranium. actually the script "may" have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors, but the dramatics of an aging diane lane acting as if she was a teenager (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach. every time she (adrienne) would jump into the arms of richard gere and then pull both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking, "oh, my aching back...this babe sure doesn't weight 125 lbs. anymore!" anyway, both characters were distinctly unlikeable, especially richard gere's: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (dr. paul flanner) that was on some kind of "soul quest" after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. dr. flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets up with adrienne. she is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental. of course, that's where dr. flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling madly in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon). in between romantic interludes and a nauseating song/dance routine that lane (adrienne) performs while listening to an old lp (no cd's?), they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up. dr. flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (naturally dr. flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous, distracting boy.) to make a long (predictable) story short, adrienne helps dr. flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a "routine" cyst removal of the face). dr. flanner is finally able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by scott glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. "i told him she was too old for that much juice!" glenn's character,(robert torrelson) appears to accept dr. flanner's apology. it's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. ever more circumspect, dr. flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. unfortunately, that means he must temporarily bid adieu to adrienne. of course, while entertaining the natives in timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. evidently, apologizing to robert torrelson for his wife's death was the second hardest thing. in the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been...hopefully no more gere/lane sequels!

i had high hopes for this film, even though i had not read the book. richard gere and diane lane together--should be good already. but the film does not deliver on the promise. i kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't. i have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love. that can happen. but we never really get to know the characters. i would have liked more focus on them. the film reminded me in places of bridges of madison county, and that film was far better. i really felt for the characters in that film, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between clint eastwood and meryl streep that there wasn't between gere and lane. each of them are very good actors in his or her own right. simply not the right movie for them together.

lonely, disconnected, middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future. at some sort of bed and breakfast by (well, literally in the sea) the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she subs for the owner. enter lonely, arrogant richard gere. he is a plastic surgeon. he is the only guest at the inn in the sea. diane lane is the lonely housewife. you'll never guess these two fall immediately in love. a tropical storm makes them true lovers.the subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense. the locations, photography are fine. gere remains one of the most over-rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint. ms. lane must've needed the money, but phones in her part with grace.

while i am not a woman, i can enjoy a chick flick if its good. this one however is beyond bad. you have the by the book story, girl is getting divorced, boy with issues shows up. boom magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purpose.now while i can believe that kind of thing might happen, i am not an idiot. it wouldn't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy-pumpy, it would take time. yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen, i suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel... but most people don't.now, if that isn't enough... the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry... well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed... so how could they hit you again? why i know, lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye.... and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice (completely unreal, but who cares).so there you have it... girl find boy, boy find love, death finds boy and mom cries.... what a movie - not.

this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen.casting: richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. supporting cast not too memorable.story: the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. the story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive. not destined to be a great one to remember.

here in australia nights in rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the notebook. quite frankly what a lot of rot.this film is a like a recipe. on paper we have all the right ingredients... richard gere normally perfect in this genre, diane lane an old favourite from "under tuscan sun" and "unfaithful", ocean side location, solitude and yet the movie sucks. at the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left! the main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place. and perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that gere and lane's characters bring to the movie. there's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see... romance! there's no warmth from gere's character, lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out. so as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters.others here say the book is great. well be it the screenplay, direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie. it's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place.very disappointing... save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate.

wow, what an overrated movie this turned out to be! it was supposed to be "an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home." well, i doubt it terrorized audiences in the early '50s and i know it would put today's audiences asleep."sends shivers down the spine," proclaims the new york times. no, the only shivers i get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the n.y. times prints about anything.well, it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man. "howard wilton" (robert ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. in fact, this was one of the nicest roles ryan ever played! yes, "wilton" was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trust.the film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of yakking. beware, my reader.....this sucks.

frankly, after cotton club and unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film, because it is bad. the acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere. it was well shot, but, then again, it is a big budget movie. it was too predictable, even for a chick flick. i even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end, the only thing i didn't know was how. too politically correct. very disappointing. the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. but, if you want that, watch national geographic. i love lane, but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy. as far as gere goes, he's a good actor, but he had movies like this, so i'm not surprised. an hour and a half i wish i could bring back.

richard gere and diane lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending i get really angry about...lets just say its not my cup of tea, just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.the plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with. he goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. this is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief. i wouldn't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable. why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? it really ruined it for me.if you like romance give it a shot, though wait for cable.

my husband brought this home from the video store, so i could watch something while stuck home sick. the sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book, but a sorta silly, light, romantic flick sounds just right (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). well, he meant well.my first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house must be fake...it's not only isolated alone on the beach, but set on moorings into the loose sand, and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! this looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country, in the fall), so potentially disastrous that i was sure filmmakers had simply cgi'd the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute b&b into the surf).but i have to tell you guys, thanks to "teh interwebs", i can say that the house, "serendipity" is very real, is indeed near rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs, appears mostly as it does in the film. you can rent it yourself, off season, for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! go for it! but...interestingly, the house has severe problems. the second thing that struck me after "would be washed away" was "what about the plumbing/electrical? in that surf?", and sure enough, "serendipity" was condemned for a break in the sanitation, caused by overwash from the ocean. (they are rebuilding.)and the house isn't from the "civil war". not to mention that viola davis, playing "cliché black best friend" (thankless role for a fine actress, last seen in "doubt"), is not remotely old enough that her grandmother could have built anything in the civil war! hello! that was 150 years ago! try great-great-great! (in reality, "serendipity" was built in 1988, laughably recently.) the basic film is built on a typical nicholas sparks weeper, which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance. it is also aimed in a very pandering way towards "women" -- you know, us women who love b&bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks...who dream of romance and guys who look like richard gere and dancing in the moonlight. don't give us plot, or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!gere plays a plastic surgeon, who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. of course, she died of an overdose of anesthesia, so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! hello! where is that guy? why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and is staying at the remote b&b...who should be there, why the only other person in the inn...diane lane! she's a lonely divorcée, with rotten kids, and an ex-hubby who wants her back. while she's trying to decide about that, the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the b&b.now, in the real world, if this set up ever even happened, the doctor would look like ernest borgnine...and the lonely divorcée, like rosie o'donnell. he'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. but this isn't the real world; i digress.the couple confess all, fall in love, a hurricane hits...they make love, fall in love, he has to go away, he dies and she cries a lot about that. the end.there, i've saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands, sons, boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe. very wearying.someone else asked why diane lane, a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she's 45ish and not over-the-top, so she isn't threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls. this would make sense if she was chubby, but she isn't.anyways, someone throw a pretty, paisley shawl over this film. so we don't have to watch it. conclusion: read a book, unless you are too sick. if too sick, go to sleep.

if you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like i was. the book was great and i was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well, however i felt like i was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. the movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense. i think both diane lane and richard gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. the book was true love story and i think this movie could of been a lot better.

i watched the beginning twice, could not make sense of it, and it bothered me for the whole movie.so, work this out with me: wayne (the good guy) jumps on the stagecoach, disarms the drivers (!), steals the money (?!), and takes off.disarmed, one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys. thanks to wayne, who disarmed them, and then watched it happen.then wayne drops the money in the dirt, rescues the girl, rides into town, chuckles it up with yak (too bad about the dead guy, i guess)...and then later says he "found" the money back at the scene. and everyone's okay with that.and he's the good guy? and i'm pretty sure there weren't small, hand-held flashlights at the time. and bell did his first phone demo in 1876... were they in houses then? am i thinking too hard about this one? normally, i'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie, but this one bothered me. and that's a sign the move didn't really work for me.

lone star productions sure churned them out in the 1930's, and "star packer" has the feel of one of the more rushed ones. john wayne is u.s. marshal john travers, investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as "the shadow", responsible for stealing cattle, stage holdups and the like, and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe. yakima canutt is travers' trusty indian sidekick, appropriately named as... well, "yak".early on, we find out that cattlemens union head matt matlock (george pre-gabby hayes) is really the shadow; the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his (supposed) niece anita's half of the matlock ranch, since "this is no place for a girl". as anita, verna hillie doesn't have much to do in the film, although in a comic moment, she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid.there are a few curiosities in the film - for one, wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. in what could have been a neat device, a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street. and finally, the movie doesn't truly live up to it's name, as sheriff travers never wears a badge throughout the film, that is, a star packer without a star.the horse chases, the runaway stage scenes, the stagecoach off the cliff (another curiosity, the horses conveniently get loose from the stage) are all pretty standard stuff. but john wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career. for those more critical, the white kerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache.

let me get this straight:"hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside manner."wow. move over "the notebook", there's a new kid in town.where to begin. well, how about the depth of this "relationship"? i think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps:1. exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad. 2. drink copious amounts of jack daniels; play basketball with old food 3. provide glib, unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. make love during a hurricane. 5. devote your lives to each other via airmail.i noticed george c wolfe has "the hairball" and "united kanye west project" in his dossier. would "stick to your genre" be too harsh? enough said. i think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, or laugh or even hope. but the reason they are able to do that is that, somewhere during the storyline, we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen. to make us care, there must be time spent developing these characters...their lives, their history, why we're watching them now. wolfe didn't seem to want to "waste our time" with such trivialities, and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one-on-one interaction between two actors we've all come to adore, but two characters we could care less about.for one brief tender moment when richard gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him for dinner, the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. but instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy that is courtship, we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know.let's face it. we have all heard cheesy one liners in romantic films. but the reason we cut some slack to bogart in "casablanca" or nicholson in "something's gotta give" is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters, and by the time they deliver the line, we're so deeply involved with their plight, we don't even notice the cheese factor. since wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists, all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience.wolfe takes the old hollywood director's phrase "cut to the chase" much too literally here. as each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast, the viewer is left wondering if director wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: "c'mon. it's a richard gere romance. just buy in."it is as a result of this stunning lack of character - or relationship - development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts. when gere's character dies, i felt like i was watching the news about someone i didn't know passing away. or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics. just. didn't. care.epic. fail.

with great expectations i went to see this film, spain's contribution to the oscar-race this year. part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. it fails in delivering the "message" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. there are some so extreme misfires i haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense). the spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and rapidly losing patience, and some of the commentaries i overheard was whether the members of the spanish academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the oscar contest.

obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little vasque town of obaba. in this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. the result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of obaba. any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. it was by far the best film of the year in spain, but, well, that's not saying too much. the only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios. it is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story.

i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself... am i going crazy..? can't i see the beauty from a film like this..? am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out? i don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. the film idea was going nowhere... i was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did! nothing exceptional... not even the landscapes (i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice.. but no). just a lame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy students... now all grown up, each of them.. with his/her own fixed ideas. and boy some of those ideas were stupid.. like the lizard story for example. at a moment i thought i was watching x files.. with the lizard entering in the ear and all. no.. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if u pay for the ticket) the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye "german" kid... he played very well and convincing for his age... the rest... nothing! i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas. well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film... i think to myself again.. maybe i am the crazy one. advice.. don't waste your time with this!

although this starts out promisingly, a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard! this gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, something almost david lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately, the film starts to go everyplace, not having a core center, just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. the character study goes all over the place, and i couldn't really care for any of the characters it seems, especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into flashback mode. i had some hopes for this movie, but all in all, it was a bit of a letdown.

i saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. sometimes i can get into intellectual romantic movies. this movie just did not move me. i felt like it was about one hour too long. camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. i thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. if you like tragedies, you might like this. i just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. i would not recommend this movie. if you want to see a good romantic tragedy go watch titanic.

while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth.the case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of gustav mahler and andrew lloyd-webber that plays constantly and loudly, and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. and then it really counts the story elides the details at the end.this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book: this is not writing, this is barbara cartland. precisely the same critique can be made of this film: a deceptive, mawkish vanity project.

forget the lousy acting, that can be forgiven in this sort of film. or even the terrible, unnatural dialog and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made? watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago. a computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? a dial up internetconnection? clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures ("he! look over there...is that..is that a face?" -zoom in on face- -oops, sound breaks off- 'chop' -next scene- ), scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result don't flow at all. you'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected, smiling and going about.apart from the many problems i have with the movie in terms of production-value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring.i recommend 'shutter' in stead, an oriental (thai) horror movie done well.

i never fell asleep during a movie. never. this movie did the impossible.while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. as in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. the acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. did these people even get any direction? were they coaxed to be boring and dull? either therory wouldn't surprise me.what was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. either way, they all stunk. don't watch this film. that's all i can say (unless you're an insomniac).

do not see this film. in most cases, such as that of ju-on and the grudge, the japanese film are infinitely better than the american remake. however, this movie was terrible. the ghosts, much like a trick or treater dressed as a sheet ghost moan and wheeze in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is just horrible. the story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained leaving the film to go from bad to worse. do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and i am sure that there are more entertaining things to do - like watching paint dry.

i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seems to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense.all in all, i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts, but they are repetitive, i felt like i was watching a loop trailer; seems like it was a short film shot with different actors.in the veins of ringu and grudge but not even close the the hype...the excessive length killed the thrill.unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies (wich i thought i was), don't waste your time on this one.

i like all different types of movies, so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes the matrix etc etc.i just felt it was a lousy movie. i don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. they were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, richard gere and diane lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? it isn't realistic. this movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. some emotional connection. if someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. you are neither right or wrong. different strokes for different folks.another very unbelievable component to the movie was diane lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? this movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a major disappointment.

would be promising if it were a student film. never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. as a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. there's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. characters are barely sketched, which could be ok, but they're completely uninteresting. it's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.

i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. i really don't understand what all of the hype was about. for one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad ("what if something strange is going on?"...what????). the acting didn't blow my socks off either. it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and i didn't give a hoot about them at all. another thing is that the movie extremely boring. extremely. sure, there are a couple of "jolts" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. what was the point of that??to top it off, the movie makes no sense. yes, i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. and don't even get me started with the ending. what exactly happened there?i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. if they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. but they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. yes, it's a message movie. okay, fun. i'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this.

i was so excited to finally watch "pulse" after receiving it from amazon, and i have to say i was utterly disappointed. i perhaps think i was too hyped up. i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. after loving other asian horrors, i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart.the story was slow, painfully so. i am a diverse fan of horror. i love the brutal, bloody craziness of "the devil's rejects" and i love equally the steady, growing macabre of "a tale of two sisters". "pulse" offered little from either spectrum, sadly.along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled. i hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors. unlike "a tale of two sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, "pulse" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors. my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency. at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet. that's a damn original idea. i like that. but as the plot drones on, plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in, it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale (as evident by the ending) that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute.i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shadowy surroundings. i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie, but that may have just been my attention waning in and out.the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well, and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters. like i mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things. to be honest i don't really care.the acting was decent. certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either. no outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful.now i'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments. one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout, i would've enjoyed this movie (almost) wholly. i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling, as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. the things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster, baffling and "wtf" for me to truly appreciate.now for something pertaining to the dvd itself... magnolia's release of "pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. they aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech. it may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others. i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (never watch dubbing!!!) i tried to like the film, i really did. i wanted this film to live up to the hype... but sadly, it fell flat for me. if you're looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you "audition", "shutter", "a tale of two sisters", "strange circus" and "marebito" -- all of which are more my palette.

kairo, or pulse as it's known amongst english speaking audiences, is set in tokyo & starts as sunny plant sales employee michi kudo (kumiko aso) decides to visit her friend taguchi (kenji mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her. meanwhile a student named ryosuke kawashima (haruhiko kato) has recently hooked up to the internet & keeps getting spooky messages & images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz harue karasawa (koyuki) whats happening, she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full & they need somewhere else to go & earth is as good a place as any, right? these spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, i don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...this japanese production was written & directed by kiyoshi kurosawa & right off the bat i have to say i hated kairo, i hated everything about it & it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker. the script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & kairo is also the most downright boring film i've sat through this year. at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through, i really wanted to fast-forward it but i'm fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end & frankly wished i hadn't. there are so many things wrong with kairo, i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous & deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly. then there's the whole internet thing which i just couldn't relate to at all, i use the internet all day & it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way. then there's the fact that kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me, maybe i'm a neanderthal but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me, make some sort of sense & not bore me to death.director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as i'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd & you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you. i didn't think kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads i get, now that's scary! i hate this film, i hate this film, i'm sorry i just need to make that basic point again, twice. forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. if you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way. urgh.the film looks so dull & boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a mexican soap opera. since kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so i won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language & you don't know what they are saying.kairo is crap, i hated it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. just because it's an asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense & it's an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production. the worst film i've seen this year by some distance. kairo got a hollywood remake as pulse (2006).

this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. there's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in ringu). frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. this was sobering and fascinating.i love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans. however, one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just can't relate to very well are these horror films. i know they are super popular--especially since they seem to be remade so often in the states. i've seen both ringu as well as the ring, ju-on and the grudge and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was seance--a reworking of the great british film, seance on a wet afternoon. and what, do i think, made seance different? well, unlike the other films as well as kairo, gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience--instead, the emphasis was on the story. the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday 13th--with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary (at best). for me, i want story--not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.with a relatively high rating, i know i am in the minority, but i just don't find this a very satisfying film. all too often, minor things occur that might startle someone slightly--but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say "this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking". well, i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression--not scare tactics.

gritty drama? emotionally powerful? blah! the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the wire, sopranos and carnivale from hbo. okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'the street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. tv (british tv) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the american productions.there was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'. there was no indication that this man was 'insane' enough to beat up a man he has respected for such a long time. there was no remorse when he did it and this shouldn't be the sort of character that would back down when bob hoskins called his son a pansy, in a display of 'bravery'.i wish i was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show, but i am not and although i can't prove my point well enough, believe me when i say that this was rubbish, shock tv, that provides no real inward looking perspective on life.1/5 stars.

well,this movie is really "plumped" haha get it? thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. the plot is just a copy of pulp fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if "plump" (haha)! is really unbelievable.the storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. it did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. i mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh. most of the supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. the film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall. they could have done a much funnier job,seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film,they were gambling,and hey! i think they lost!in overall plump fiction,is "plumpable" but you wont gather much at all!worth watching over and over again?: no once is enough,actually its more than enough!so is it worth the rent? ummm..as i said,its "plumpable",but you will only gather a few "plumps" from it!overall out of 10: a 4 out of 10!

...about this film was the title song. after 30 minutes, i discontinued watching because it was so lame. bad story, bad actors, bad movie. if you want to watch a good movie, watch pulp fiction instead.

if you watched pulp fiction don't see this movie. this movie is not funny. this is the worst parody movie ever. this is a poor attempt of parody films.the cast is bad. the film is bad. this is one of the worst pictures ever made.i do not recommend plump fiction. i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino. this is one of the worst parody films ever made.plump fiction is not a good movie. it is not funny. it is so dumb and vulgar.

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way!!

wow. not because of the 3-d imagery, which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery, but what a lame ending! the end of the movie just seems to implode on itself. this film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. the misogyny of this film is painful as well. if you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at (aka 'bot fodder), go for it. otherwise, look for better films.

the worst movie ever made. if anyone asks you what is the worst movie you've ever seen - tell them plump fiction. of all the movies i've ever seen this gotta be the most lame experience. even the poorest sequels are pure masterpieces compared

...when this movie was on.what a bore. an attempt at humor, but really not pulling it off too well. some good ideas were cast, and the actors makeup and wardrobe were ok.i expected a lot more, unfortunately i couldn't sit through any more of it, i switched off halfway through the video, and ejected the tape, went to the rental store to get my money back...

..this movie being one of them.i remember, in the middle of the movie, me and my friend justlooked at each other, shaked our heads and laughed.. in despair.see it if you wish, if you feel that you have the time to wasteand don´t mind 1.5 hrs of catatonia.

this can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. but i have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. the resovoir dogs parody was one of them. the rest are not important enough to be remembered.to be honest, i was a little disappointed by this movie. the plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. the whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted. there was also a whole lot of unessecary sequences, that was a total waste of film. i do realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter, but it would only make it better.now, with the good and the bad things lined up, let's go to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats up for this one.

this is a spin off of pulp fiction. i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. the whole plot doesn't follow on the pulp fiction plot. it turns to other movie like forrest gump and more. some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. if you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense. please if there is a plump fiction 2, i will definitely not go on and rent the sequel. just giving a heads up for those out there.

now first let me say i love god awful movies. especially horror films mainly. i watched hundreds of movies on mystery science theater 3000 with no pain. but this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! i had to turn it off it was so bad. it was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. give me 3 back to back viewings of manos the hands of fate or monster a-go-go over this any day. avoid this film like the plauge!! now excuse me while i go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth i had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film. only one decent gag in the part i watched was the hitmen now are an extermination pair for hitmen exterminators. even that wasn't to great of a gag.

without a doubt, the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. there was nothing entertaining about this film. i know it was supposed to be a comedy, but it actually made me cry at the thought of losing the $4.75 admission price.

i consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned in my chair.it's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. not once did i laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. i have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one i remember best - in my nightmares.the only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.this is the worst movie ever.

in all honesty, i haven't seen this film for many years, but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. i can't risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. you have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. i don't know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults.

police officer michael (tomas arana, "the church") has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who's been leaving parts of the bodies of the people that he's been murdering at the house of one recently widowed, tracy (joanna pacula). mike has to find a way to stop the bodies from piling up, while perhaps finding love in the process.a feeling of the 'giallo' films of yore pervades this film, even though we know who the killer is from the get-go, and the film contains a few good set-pieces (a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind being particularly memorable), but it doesn't make all that much sense when all is said and done either. all in all, not nearly as good as bava's earlier "macabre" nor his first two "demons" films, but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film. a pity the image entertainment dvd lacked extras of any kind, as i would have been interested in some.my grade: c-

tu pa tam is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from slovenia, who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas. tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moments. in many interviews director mitja okorn tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didn't cost a lot of money. but thinking that way is wrong. tu pa tam is for me very bad movie. the dialogs are really bad written (90% of the script is consisted of cursing), the characters are stereotypical morons, the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie supposed to be an action comedy) are filmed very very bad and without any style. okorn is just thinking he's even bigger than quentin tarantino, so he's copying his style over all 90 minutes. the humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (okorn probably thinks that constant cursing is funny). in my opinion is tu pa tam very cheap (not only by budget)movie with stupid story and very very bad acting.

of the thousands of movies i've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the "wasted talents" expression. i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (frédéric pierrot, elsa zylberstein,and so on). the "aging" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. the use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that i could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly. so far, antoine de caunes has been quite a good actor, but seeing this one and "les morsures de l'aube" i think he should start considering quitting. please antoine, give up that "master of balantree" project ; i doubt you deserve it.

the actors are so bland that it's almost impossible to tell them apart (pauline kael said of this movie: "the actors have names, but they're truly anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. they simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and by recycling the trick that let fred astaire dance on the ceiling in "royal wedding" (but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing). the low point of the movie is when one of the characters, an airplane tycoon, is trying to convince some other "giants of industry" to come in with him in a moon-rocket consortium, and he shows them a woody woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level! (and to think that robert heinlein worked on the screenplay...)the only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of "amazing stories" sensibility, and even that is done much better in the producer's (george pal) subsequent movie "when worlds collide", which has similar bad acting, but is much more entertaining. however, pal's best sci-fi movie has to be "the time machine".

this movie may bear some historical importance, and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together, the setting, the rocket, the space suits, the surface of the moon, all scream "a classic" - but in the end, the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes, and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments. the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis, but bear too little entertainment value many times.much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine-year-olds. the mature themes, the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as well.the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in "2001", but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient. especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie, and, has star wars not somehow modelled it's space-scrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film? but then again - the inheritance is marginal.if its a real groundbreaking and mega-influential mature 1950ies sci-fi classic you are looking for however, check out "forbidden planet".

i didn't even watch this whole movie. now, i like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. for one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. he sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at earth and this boob says 'can you see brooklyn?' and another guy says 'sure'. and the boob says 'gee, i wonder who's pitching?' pardon me a moment, i think my sides are splitting.when they first get up into orbit the boob says 'the moon is just for looking at! take me back down!' watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the g-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big "the end" on the screen.)we also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity. as baby huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, "that sounds logical!" the no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go up.)how this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. i really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. i think in retrospect it's not the whole movie i hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' omg. i wonder if he checked the fan belts too. maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been quite so excruciating. even so, it's only average. what everyone else is raving about, i don't know.you want to watch a neat 1950's space movie? 'rocketship x-m' beats it all to heck. maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.

this film is just another waste of time. the plot is ridiculous, forced usa drama. the characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic goya and the bad interpretation of bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. i guess it was no a low budget film. definitely not recommended. maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.no more hope in cinema...

i'm going to recommend putting this one in the "skip it" pile as well. i was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it, and a bit more excited when i saw that milos forman directed it. ah, well.....the costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio. there was no distinction between spanish, british and french - everyone dressed like they were at court in versailles. the sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings - the prison didn't feel like a prison, the mansions didn't feel like mansions, and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot, for all that they were probably practical locations.the score was dramatically less than it could have been. i have been a fan of film scores since my youth, noticing, appreciating and collecting them, by which i mean more than john williams. my fiancée is a professional film composer, an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center, and a rising star in the industry. at the start of the film, we had high hopes for it, and it did indeed start off nicely. it rapidly deteriorated, and at several points - including the scene of the release of the prisoners - it actually reached a level of annoyance. i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume. the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene, and didn't integrate itself into the "soul" of the film (think of the music in babel and you'll have an idea of what i mean). it never attained the grandeur it wanted to, but then neither did the film.javier bardem, as talented as he is, was awful. for the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance. during the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like the love-child of keith richards and stuart townshend's lestat. i never got the idea that he cared about the role (which is to say, that the character cared about his life and actions), or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end.natalie portman was very good, although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking lorenzo's hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance. the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly discern, and if it weren't for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn't know they weren't the same character. the prosthetic teeth were horrible, artificial and distracting, but that's no knock on ms. portman.stellan skarsgård was fine as goya. not oscar-worthy, but serviceable and generally believable. i don't know much about the life of goya, or his deafness, but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information, rather than anything that was utilized in the film. i am sure it affected goya's life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter, but you'd never know it from watching this. for the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30% of the time through lip-reading.don't get me started on randy quaid. at least he was a minor character.the script reads like one of the "choose your own adventure" books i used to read as a kid: at several moments through the film, several outcomes are possible, and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out. ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its meager attempts at leavening the mood through small bits of humor. the joke about the hands? maybe it's because i paint (not well) as a hobby and know what a pita hands are to draw/paint, but i saw the joke coming a mile away, as well as the reprise in the second half. was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by ines? there might as well have been a line of bread crumbs.disappointing.(note: this review is a copy of a reply i made to a thread in the forum)

this isn't exactly a complicated story. it's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. with goya's ghosts this doesn't apply. the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail. it jumps from one character to the next, never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching. because of that you don't connect with any of the characters. you don't get to the point where you care. either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems it's going to redeem itself, or their actions are despicable and you're not inclined to anyway. goya's refusal to go very far to help ines is a good example. his refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part. the only characters you may momentarily feel for are ines, when she's being questioned and then tortured. after her rape by lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone. following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around lorenzo's invitation to supper with ines' family, and her fathers all out attempt to force lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back. then just as things start to be developing again, they're gone from the movie. i've read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didn't know what it wanted to be, etc. i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything. from lorenzo's return and the coincidental viewing of ines' daughter by goya, everything seemed nothing more than contrived. without much of a storyline, no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place. the essence of who goya was didn't materialize, other than his actions, or lack thereof, proving him to be more self-centered than anything else. as for his art, the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again frittered away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. to sum things up best, the movie had no cohesion, it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered, and upon ending, left you feeling like what you'd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them. you can't watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination. there's just not enough to it to waste the time. it's not a case of your missing out on something, it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good, just aren't there. as for best film ever made? it's not even the best film i've watched today.

having watched this movie several times, i have come to the conclusion that milos forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the french revolution and the napoleonic era raged across europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. while i do understand that mr. forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, i was left feeling that there was just so much of goya left out, so much of his humanity. the strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that because of man's fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life, each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of god. how eloquent when goya says he should have helped ines more, how true for all of us! we must defend and protect the innocent. the superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die pronounces the death sentence on lorenzo who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius. i was left wanting something more when the credits rolled. maybe less of the unreal coincidences, and more of the inner life of the characters.

i had this dvd to watch, thinking that i would see a type of biography o painter goya, but the movie was about everything but goya. this movie is about a young woman taken away from her family by the holy inquisition, allegedly because she practiced jewish rituals (only because the poor girl did not like eating pork!). the rest of the movie is about torture, humiliation, driven by a poor script (can't believe it is by jc carrière as i could not believe this cr** is directed by mr milos forman) centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all. ah, and there is goya, i forgot, playing a completely peripheral role - that could be the role of john, paul, peter, manuel, joaquim, jose or anyone. very disappointing - one one these movies that will be forgotten for ever (if it has not had happened yet). rent "the name of the rose" if you want a movie about the holy inquisition. and i don't know what you should rent, if you want to watch a movie about spanish painter goya. maybe a director of a good caliber, not forman, still needs to make it. ps: the spanish painter, goya - the title role who is lost in the plot - is portrayed by a scandinavian actor, something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously. maybe next time we should send javier barden to play the biopic of norwegian painter, edvard munch!

then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. i got the first part with the spanish inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain. the movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and i don't remember much about it. so, the movie gets confusing then. the movie begins when ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of judiasm by the church, specifically father lorenzo. she is put to the question and forced to confess. even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison. her father forces lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp, in hopes of getting ines released. all it does is give a reason for the church to condemn lorenzo, who runs off to france.then, the movie skips many years, and the french revolution is in full force. ines is released from prison. it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up. she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help. she tells him she had a child in prison. goya sets up a meeting between her and lorenzo, whom is now with the french and in power. he is the father. goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo, whom decides it's best to send her off to america, so no one will find out. but before his plans get carried out, the british join the spainish, and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted. that part is not well told in the film. it's like the film shows this to happen in a day.final verdict: the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the inquistion, then the movie expects you to understand what is going on. it just got too confusing to me then.

with a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, goya. then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic inquisition. with even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. with lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, milos forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.milos forman (who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. won awards for it, in fact. his life in czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse, repellent regimes, especially communism. he also made the equally over-the-top but rather impressive, one flew over the cuckoo's nest. so, at the age of 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? in goya's ghosts, goya is one step removed from buffoon. the main character is brother lorenzo, passionately acted by javier bardem. natalie portman is equally vibrant as goya's model ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). the tenuous connection with goya is that he happens to paint both of them.lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) ines who he suspects of being a jew. her father tortures lorenzo. napoleon dashes in to liberate spain (briefly). ines gets out of the dungeon the church has left her in and searches for her child. goya is still painting but has gone deaf. his main preoccupation seems to be helping ines. and so on.historically, goya was also a historian. as forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of goya the painter, this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together  a large slice of history as seen by goya. but the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. similarly, a document of the terrors of the inquisition should be done  compared to other despotic orders throughout time, the holy see has been forgiven with barely a confession. though one might ask if forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything."i thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "there were a great many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the spanish inquisition." but the story is too tenuous to hold our attention. against our expectations and with a background of something major (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the inquisition, and even the french revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted (if kind) infatuation of goya's. the result is that we feel cheated.background detail is appallingly handled. goya went deaf in 1792 (when the film starts), not 15 years later. napoleon is as believable as a cut-out from a cereal packet. we see the church passing out a death sentence (when the normal procedure was for the church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work). battles look overly-choreographed and stagey. a peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it.on the positive side, the production values are mostly good. the colours are vivid, the pacing excellent (at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline.) bardem is excellent, and portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman. while it doesn't say very much about goya, what it does say is nice, even if superficial and pretty irrelevant.i once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and i asked each other, if you could choose a director to depict your life, who would it be? on his record, forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list.

perhaps i missed something, but i found goya's ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama. as to the story it was trying to tell, i found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. and perhaps it should have been made by a spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented english. i can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar "artist's model's tragic fate" plot line as girl with a pearl earring. was the movie a commentary on the religious injustices of the inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what???? i never seemed to be able to figure that one out. natalie portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical. and ultimately the movie was crowned with the concluding melodrama of a disheveled bardem's head and body hanging on the edge of cart heading off into the sunsetwith ines and goya following along behindcan't milos forman do better than that?

artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel dinelli from his play "the man" concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal. despite solid work from ida lupino and robert ryan (both trying their best), this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually dull) and underpopulated cast of characters (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!). hokey and humorless, with a stilted direction from harry horner (perhaps lupino should have directed?). where's all the suspense promised by the ads? dinelli also served as a co-producer. *1/2 from ****

the only reason this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the acting of both ida lupino and robert ryan is superb. ida lupino who is lovely, as usual, becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman. robert ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to the next. seemingly simple and docile, suddenly he becomes clever and threatening. ms. lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along. she could not manage to get out of her of her own house: windows didn't open, both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. you could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried. she did not take the precaution of having even one extra key. nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor. i don't know what war her husband was killed in, but if it was world war ii, the furnishings in her house, the styles of the clothes, especially the children and the telephone company repairman's car are clearly anachronistic. i recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find.

beware, my lovely (1952) dir: harry horner production: the filmmakers/rko radio picturescredulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of collier young and ida lupino, aka the filmmakers (with lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). robert ryan is the 'peril' and ida lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the 'woman in peril' style film. ryan plays howard wilton, a tightly-wound psychotic handyman drifter (noooo, ryan? i know, hard to believe). lupino is the lonely war widow, helen gordon, who hires howard to do some work around her house. things go downhill from there as howard makes helen a prisoner in her own home. howard has a nasty secret, not that he could reveal it. you see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. maintaining it, that is. he has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead. this is part of the film's problem. the nature of howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). he can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. his violent, threatening, anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting, inadequacies involving the war, due to his being rejected for service). i don't know how he even made it past the interview with helen. there are other implausibilities. if you were locked in your house with a madman, but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time, couldn't you figure out a way to escape? ryan, i think, is defeated by the material. it feels like he's overplaying his hand. his series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there, done-that robotic feel to them. at this point in his career he'd probably played this character, to some degree, ten times and it shows. we are encouraged to empathize with howard (i didn't) through shown bits of humanity, like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him. lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress, which she is more than capable of and does. the picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? so naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, christmas tree decorations). this indicated something going on, or about to go on, in his head. horner (1953's vicki), who made his reputation in production design, does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison. credit too, the always reliable rko art department for the work on the house. in the end, sub-standard work from the principals, who all have much better films to their credit. *½ out of 4

john candy was very much a hit-or-miss comic actor. his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot, but wagons east, in which he plays a bumbling wagonmaster who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west, is even sadder. i don't understand why it was even released. the story is pointless and weak, and the jokes aren't there. it saddens me even further that candy's last film would be his all-time worst movie. so let's forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental, planes, trains and automobiles and uncle buck.0 out of 5

"wagons east" was a big disappointment for me. but the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john candy's last film role (he died just before shooting was completed on this). there are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof, and for a comedy that doesn't cut it. if you want to see a uproarious spoof of western movies, the answer is obvious. see mel brooks' classic "blazing saddles". or if you want to see candy in much better material, see "summer rental", "spaceballs", or "uncle buck" (just to name a few). these three movies (as well as others) shows us what a great comic actor he was. unfortuneately, "wagons east" does not. what a shame!* (out of four)

jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. drew barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as "poison ivy", must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael (he was the cinematographer on "ivy"); playing a character named daisy drew (!), she's bumped off right away, which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young (who hasn't had a single subtle moment on camera since "blade runner"). this witless script, by michael angeli, concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife's face from a murder witness's testimony, and while that's not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better suited to an hour-long tv series. this cable-made movie is short on inspiration (beginning with the casting) and shorter on surprises. * from ****

in the aftermath of september 11th in new york, this drama about american firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. the story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter jack morrison (joaquin phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with captain mike kennedy (john travolta) via the radio. the flashbacks basically show how jack grows from being a recruit, seeing kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. of course, in the present day, jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known. also starring jacinda barrett as linda morrison, terminator 2's robert patrick as lenny richter, morris chestnut as tommy drake, billy burke as dennis gauquin, balthazar getty as ray gauquin and tim guinee as tony corrigan. the blazes of the film are ultimately all i could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them, the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking. adequate!

first off, i'm not a firefighter, but i'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for sar), so i had some training and simulation but i have no real-life experience.but still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. i can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. but some things defy logic: - no second mask attached to the oxygen. how the hell do you want to rescue people trough the smoke without one? - rappelling people. no, it's not done like that. i'd be screaming too if somebody hitched a rope around me in that fashion and hung me from a building. if i could scream, that is, and not pass out from want of air because the rope squeezes my lungs. the second time when they're abseiling jack it's better but still weird.- "aim high". no, you bloody don't. you always fight fire from as low as possible. you don't fight want to sprinkle flames, you'll want to extinguish the fire, and that's below the flames.- no discipline. they're running around like chicken. and they shout all the time, instead of using radio, and keeping discipline.- no tactics. why don't they work in teams of at least two? you still can get separated, but it takes much more than if everyone just scurries around alone in search for victims.- do they really enter buildings without bringing water? i europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without.- firefighters on the roof. wtf do they think they're doing there without security lines or water? - exploding rooms. wood and brick does not "explode suddenly".the better points are actually camaraderie and the other non-firefighting parts of the movie. it's a lot of kitsch, but that's alright. i'll give it a point for this.

this film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a american dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. now i know they try to show jack morrison(joaquin phoenix) as a typical american father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. this movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. john travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film. what could have been a good film is that the firefighter are put way up as heroes because they are firemen and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama.4.9/10

this really is a cringe making exercise. dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of "we're just a bunch of wacky guys" in the midst of the "my goodness this can be really dangerous" parts. mostly it is just plain dumb. you couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. it is so awful i couldn't bear to watch at times. if my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end i would have had no option but to turn it off.thing is i'm a john travolta fan. every interview of his i've seen just raises my opinion of him. i think this was one strictly for the money. i'm sure he'll be happy when this one gets forgotten.

one of the worst movies ever made. let's start with the superficial: joaquin phoenix is, first of all, too fat to be a rookie fireman. the nyfd does not recruit pillsbury dough boys. john travolta has a bad dye job, and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended scientology bender. the plot hits on all the tropes and clichés of what the average joe believes life as a firefighter is really like: they all get drunk, get into fights, have a hard time expressing their emotions, their wives all stay at home crying, they all have father issues, everyone has a boston accent, et cetera. an execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9-11 -- which was, by the way, valid cultural hero worship. this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship.

it's just a bad film.not as bad as r.i.c.c.o. but bad.it got me hooked at the beginging then totally lost me after that.the acting was way off then on then going way way way off.do not see this movie at all costs,trust me with all my heart!!!!the directors who are brothers are not the next hughes brothers,who made really great films like dead presidents,from hell,american pimp,and menace ii society.the only person who made me watch this was the acting of paris campbell,who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this.christina caparoula also did a nice job for what she got.i hope the fittest is 10 times better than this piece of crap!

this film has no plot, no good acting, to be honest it has nothing, the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you. i wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous! ice-t isn't even a good rapper and even worse at acting, every bit of the film is rubbish, i got this film on dvd without knowing what it was for the price of £1.99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain, i then looked at the imdb rating and didn't take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the dvd i had bought was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it!

i really enjoyed the film. it was really cheesy at times. (they destroy the villain with hair driers--but where are they plugged in?) it's a unique film though, and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope. i also enjoyed fanuel (however you write it...) liking megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb. besides the acting, the "rewinding" and showing what happened on ariel's and then megan's point of view was quite interesting. i saw it twice and i'd see it again

this is a silly movie with much singing and dancing. acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. there are rememberable performances by buddy epsen, with a short but outstanding performance by gypsy rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. a totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating exibition of alice in wonderland. many parts are worth watching, but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie

this is indeed a spectacularly bad film, but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly, jaw-droppingly entertaining! i want to add to the other comments on this film.the "rock band" on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad wigs.watch for the severe continuity problem with the kid's stuffed tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back again; it's filthy or clean depending on the shot.*spoiler! the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid (and the writers)!the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin, clutching his stuffed tiger and squalling away will stick permanently in your memory. listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever: late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy, the guide demands his monk's robes as payment-the priest drops on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "bonnnng" of a church bell, but the "ding" of a bell from a boxing match!this is an absolute hoot to watch.

if there's anything worse than this movie i don't want to see it. i remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of peru as an ideal vacation spot. shining path and alberto fujimori should blast away any notion that peru is a vacation paradise. the whole thing is so awful that plan 9 or even robot monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. this film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.

you may be interested to know that barricade was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before alice faye's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed. it fared modestly ok at the box-office.faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in new york city--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start. instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song number by faye) was never filmed. however, the rest of the story is pretty much intact and made release of the film possible at a running time of 71 minutes.a tired looking warner baxter is too old to be believable as faye's romantic interest and is merely perfunctory as the broken down reporter. audiences today would be offended by the depiction of chinese using fractured english phrases like "me likey make noisy". key luke is one of the chinese loyalists but plays his role in a low-key, straightforward way. arthur treacher is all but invisible and yet gets fourth billing on screen due to editing changes in the story. originally, joseph schildkraut had a role in the film but his part was eventually edited out.a mishmash of a film that will serve as entertainment only for the most die-hard alice faye fans who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role--albeit a weak one. charles winninger is totally wasted as a kindly man running the american consulate.despite all the weaknesses, there are a couple of scenes involving narrow escapes that are effectively played and karl freund's b&w photography is top notch.

an ex- informant of the east germany finishes in mexico like spy of a student group in 1971 in where she falls in love with one of the activists. this is the first co-production of mexico with germany, and although it is a good picture of the ideals that marked, and continue marking (at least to the cgh), youth, as much finishes being something insipid since to the internal dilemmas that it faces dark brown (noethem) like the passion by his ideals that adela feels (campomanes), as soon as they glimpse, in the case of him, i want to suppose, by the barrier of the language; and in the case of her by its lack of experience. reason why in the end a concrete identification with any of them does not exist, which causes that what could have been films that even served as document like red dawn, finished being one more a film; although i want to clarify that in the room many of the assistants were excited in the conversation with the director, which says to me that no longer they are so young or my ideals have changed.

a very sensitive topic--15 y/o girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her, continues to be ignored, is raped by her mom's boyfriend, becomes pregnant. there was not enough depth displayed of this situation. too much of time is taken up on the chase with the truckers transporting the baby. (interesting, this baby with asthma--you never see him cry-- except once--, be fed, have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal.) i would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationships, more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor--this should have stood up in court immediately.and this was a true story! it deserved a better telling than that!!if it weren't for the subject matter, i would have given this closer to a 0 rating. i rented this from the library. only later i found out it was a made for tv movie. oh well

****contains spoilers****as a fan of rachael leigh cook, i watched for this show to finally come on so that i could see it. i taped it so i could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!i recognize that this was a made-for-tv movie. not only that, but it was made for lifetime, which is a channel that i despise. because it was made for tv, i can ignore the huge plot holes. i can ignore the massive lack of character development in ally sheedy's character. i can overlook the fact that george c. scott and rachael leigh cook, both of whom are very talented actors, were definately not reaching the best of their abilities. i can look past the fact that don diamont's character was so cliche'd, that you knew when you saw him he was the villain. i can even pass over the obvious mistake in the timeline (she's raped during her winter break, and then over a year later she has the baby from it.)the major thing that i can't get over is this: there are two trials for the custody of the child. in the first trial, custody is awarded to the child's father because he is "better educated, has a degree from a community college, and has a full time job." in the second trial the judgement is reversed because the judge feels that there is lack of evidence that emma (rlc's character)is an unfit mother, and custody shouldn't be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the child.the problem is this: nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a thirtysomthing year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration! whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! wouldn't that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because he's a "mature adult?" mature adults don't have sex with minors! it's not the worst cable movie that you would ever see, but it's not a great show either. ** out of ****

this is possibly one of the worst movies i have had the dis-pleasure of watching in my entire life. the plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. i watched this film with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. ben kingsley's character is just plain stupid but not funny at all. it is a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tripe. tea leoni does a fine hillary clinton impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the endearing qualities of a broom handle. throw in a pointless and unexplained sub-plot and a horribly cringe worthy montage, and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes (60 in my case). avoid this film at all costs!

comedy? what's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions (by the time i turned it off) of alchoholics anonymous? set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. served up with lashings of hollywood's religious "god will save you" redemption drivel another reviewer mentioned the "sassy dialogue" of tea leone - well i managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and i still haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than tea's character in this rubbish. tea is more stony faced and shows less emotion than keanu - in fact one wonders if she too isn't addicted to something - maybe botox her face is so wooden? save yourself from being killed with boredom from this film.

i love ben kingsley and tea leoni. however, this is easily the worst movie i have seen in 10 years, and i see my share of movies. a stinker. this is a bad idea for a movie, poorly executed. nothing about it is funny, credible or interesting. i was looking for wit, irony and genuine humor. instead, this looked like most of the cast members wandered on to the set to do tea leoni a favor. it's too bad such acting talent was wasted on such hollowness. don't bother. i have to wonder what opinion the makers of this movie have of their audience to subject them to the idea of polish gangsters in buffalo, ny sending a contract murderer to san francisco to become a mortuary assistant while attending aa meetings. bill pullman should begin reading scripts before he agrees to be in a movie. sad.

i went to this film full of hope. with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treat.oh how i felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled. that i had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly doa. there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. no jokes, i am not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not one laugh in this film.2. sir ben mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not?!? 3. there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this. 2 people bumping into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more rapport.4. all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted. don't be fooled into watching this because of the names.5. for a cold ass hit-man he rubbed out more people in gandhi than this flaccid waste of time (a by the way dyed beards look really creepy) i was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - into this is frank pulling out his 9 and offing the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself - sorry it was that bad.

frank falenczyk: it isn't that i'm sorry i killed them; it's that i'm sorry i killed them badly.wow! talk about a swing and a miss. you have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! well, apparently john dahl has found a way. with an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, 'you kill me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007. on a positive note, ben kinglsey provides another great performance as the alcoholic polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap. tea leoni is good as well as is luke wilson, dennis farina, bill pullman, philip baker hall and the rest of the cast. i guess the best way to describe 'you kill me' is a terrible movie with good performances. grade: d+

this movie stars ben kingsley as frank, a hit man for some russian mobsters based out of buffalo. he is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. after he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to san francisco, where he is to attend aa meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. if you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.it gets worse. well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete lack of training, but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the aa meetings are interesting. the viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life. luke wilson is a welcome addition as frank's sponsor, although he is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us he is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). the movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the tea leoni character. she is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to frank flounders, as the two actors have no chemistry together. around the time she comes into the picture, frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. his characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in his behavior. the comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast.problems abound in this one. kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. it alternates between italian, russian, and hispanic. throughout the course of the movie, frank tells numerous people he is a hit man (including an entire aa group), but nobody seems to care, or wants to do anything about it. the movie relies on cliché scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when leoni's insufferable character chases frank down at the airport, just when he is about to board a flight back to buffalo.though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. at the end of the film, frank celebrates one year of sobriety. i hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen "you kill me". my grade: d+

as the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the x factor? this question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of patricia highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.matt damon is the ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, dickie greenleaf (law). homoeroticism and social insecurity get all tangled up in a violent conflagration which escalated and complicate themselves for the rest of the movie. law, damon and the damningly pleasant paltrow as dickie's girlfriend are ok. i liked philip seymour hoffman's cameo-ish freddie miles, the bluff society friend that ripley can never be. the problem is that the story is lumpen without arc - or redemption, for that matter - which makes it rather difficult to swallow. 4/10

the book is great. it's one of my favorite books ever. the film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! when i heard damon would play ripley, i knew this production was doomed. but i didn't expect it to be this bad. the actors go around and act very showy. except for law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. speaking italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. damon is miscast. he's way too stiff for a character that's supposed to be a chameleon. paltrow is forgettable and hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy character. talk about typecasting.what's really unforgivable about the script (written by the overrated director) is that it completely forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own, and none of them work! the addition of the jazz music stuff is totally wrong! i guess minghella's idea of italy in the late 50s, early 60s is clouded with images of chet baker roaming the italian countryside and spreading amore. yep, minghella is a true visionary. the film is so bleeding obvious. that silly scene when ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. very laughable. yes, we get the point!!! every point or detail comes across a mile away, so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. we know, for example, that the blanchett character, introduced at the beginning of the movie, will return later on only complicate things. and the soundtrack, at times, is totally inappropriate. whimsical when it shouldn't be. the film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions. there are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many that weren't in the book). this film is bad! really bad!apparently, minghella's son told his father that the ripley novel was his favorite. mr. minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son. well, the director did achieve what he set out to do: talented mr. ripley, with its hitchcock aspirations, is a film strictly made for 12 year olds!

this is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and schindler's list, did in fact have more laughs. this, not only, tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great sl is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. i wish i could meet "yahoo serious" so i could personally throttle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. there is also very few things to say about australia, seeing as they like this stupid fruit. don't get me wrong people (mel gibson) from australia are great, they brought us mad max. it makes me very nauseous that people like this garbage, (a review i just read said it was, "very funny," sickening, isn't it). i, personally will be boycotting this movie and will start a petition online to ban and burn all yahoo serious' movies for being so, and i emphasize this, so retarded.these are just my personal thoughts, no doubting they are shared by everybody who has seen this movie.note: if you are forced to watch this movie, clockwork orange style, call me to commit euthanasia on you for free.

i know everyone said this movie was utter crap and i agree with them. i spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap. i recommended they not see it. but when it came on tv, we saw the ad. i turned to family and said: "i know this is sad, but i'm thinking of watching it". my sister turned to me and said: "yeah, me too." and you know what? it was funny.by no means is this a good movie. it's absolutely a waste of time. but it's a good waste of time. you may still think it's crap and fair enough, but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy. i didn't like a couple of bits, like when the fish got hit by the car, but apart from that i thought it was good. i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces: flacco, elle mcfeast, garry mcdonald etc.so, if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. otherwise, see a drama or something.

it pains me to say this about an australian film but mr. accident ranks with the worst of the worst films i have ever seen. what's even more tragic is that it doesn't fit into the 'it's so bad it's good' category. what annoys me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been frittered away on a pointless, unfunny, underdeveloped, inept screenplay. dumb performances (what are garry mcdonald and elisabeth gore aka elle mcfeast doing in this trash?), inadequate direction, no plot and a general sense of meanness totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth. comedy! ha! do yourself a favour and stay away!

mr. accident is a deliberate series of non-stop disasters and near death experiences reminiscent of saturday morning's warner brothers cartoons. like the coyote who falls off the cliff 5 times per episode, the "leading man" (more like an over grown klutzy child) always manages to postpone his meeting with the grimm reaper.this australian "surprise" is offensively unfunny, and at times even depressing. the 2 (out of ten) are is for the visual stunts (some never attempted by anyone since daffy duck) and the use of vivid colors (like in those high class national laundry detergent commercials).there may be an age bracket where this "comedy" finds a following. i have definitely passed that age long ago. calling all preteens: here's a "ha-ha" for ya!

yahoo serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. this film proves he is completely toxic. we can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. it is right up there with "lightning jack" and "les patterson saves the world" as the most abysmal example of australian comedy imaginable. how tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in australia yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy. and to think - he had 7 years to come up with the script. true genius!

a young man falls in love with a princess but then has to go to battle to save her father's kingdom. while away, he accidentally kills an enchanted animal which brings a curse upon him. he becomes a beast and begins to kill even his own comrades. when nobody returns to the kingdom from the battle, the king renders the land of battle cursed and forbids anyone from going there. one day, a rebel who wishes to marry the princess decides that it's time they ventured into the cursed land to claim it for the king and the king agrees, when they reach the land the king is captured by the beast and the rebel returns home to lie to the kingdom that the king has been captured and killed. he assumes the throne and prepares to marry the princess but the night before her wedding, the princess escapes to the land to go and battle the beast herself. it is only when she gets to the cursed land that she begins to realise that her father is still alive and that the beast may not even be that evil after all. sadly, her discoveries lead her to pay the ultimate price in their revelation.

what can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras, and whether that was by conceit or budget constraints doesn't make the watching of this variation on a theme by romero any easier. i was constantly reminded that i was watching somebody's school project, at best derivative, at worst cheap.writer/director georg koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with stock footage, but that says more about his editing style than his directing style, which consists of in-your-face close-ups with tv cameras which made me think i was watching public-access television instead of an actual, honest-to-goodness film.the story copies and pastes bits and pieces from various sources, including the aforementioned romero's dead trilogy, the road warrior (dig that stock footage of a "future" that looks like the past) and the blair witch project.what results is an hour-and-nothing's worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans. (okay, the "humans" in this case are clones, but that doesn't change anything. it's the same menu.)the year is 2031, and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years before have started to malfunction, particularly in the dietary area. of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). it's not safe to be indoors, it's not safe to be outdoors. it's just a matter of time before the flesh-eating ghouls devour our heroes. have you seen this before? i don't mind people ripping off romero, if it's done well, but no new territory is covered in this film. it's night of the living dead meets the blair witch project, shot with television cameras. what is particularly disappointing is that the dvd cover makes it look like it was shot, at the very least, with 8mm film. this wouldn't have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap. the film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. must we continue to clone our favourite movies?

historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. however, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. this film does not. the only scene i actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. he confronts the dangerous intruder with, "i don't remember sending for room service". the main entertainment value is in its badness; i recommended my local video story put it on the "turkeys" shelf.

as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.it's on par with sam raimi's "hercules: the legendary journeys", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. you'll see the similarities at several points. most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.jack palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best. same for oliver reed. the problem is that their strong performances make square-jawed don diamont's less-than-stellar acting skills seem even more awkward. perennial bit player cas anvar was very good as well, playing a character much like salmonius in the aforementioned hercules.if you enjoyed the low budget swords-and-sorcery movies of the early 80s, you're probably going to enjoy this show as well. it's actually a shame they attached the marco polo name to it. it really has nothing to do with marco's life, contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie.

help! once again, paul schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. i rearranged a vacation so that i could see this "world premiere." what a mistake! why did schrader even want to make an exorcist film? lofty intentions are fine, but if i wanted 2 hours of theological babble, i would visit my nephew's sunday school. father merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. but an exorcist movie needs more! the relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production. who is this movie for? i didn't bother seeing the harlin version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills.the exorcist series has been quite strange. the first film was excellent, but every sequel has been unloved and pointless. why do they keep making them? i suppose schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money. but why should we go?

i usually don't write reviews for shows unless i've seen them in full. however, there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism.this show is hysterically bad. i don't think it was meant to be, but it is. i see that there's lots of praise being showered upon the show, and i honestly can't understand why--- this show is so poorly acted, the dialogue is so awful, and the plots are thin around their holes.i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards. some elements of the show work, and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work, which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me.if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it, anticipating clichéd lines and such, this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule, if you have that sort of time on your hands.the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show. if the nonsense saccharin cliché ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock, then this may be a show for you.

the only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of tru and jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.but she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. jack has no basis for believing that there is. and very conveniently, tru never asks him the right questions. nobody does. which obviously proves that the makers of the series don't have an answer.there simply is no plot!instead, they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with it's boring girl stuff, only occasionally interrupted by tru and jack's racing against each other towards ends that are unknown...it turns out that there is nothing to any of it. a teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else.your time will be better spent sleeping.

tru calling was good but it could have been great. the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future. unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down.the writing wasn't too bad but there were holes. in episode 13, "drop dead gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim. this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help. yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poison.in episode 15, "the getaway", the off-duty policeman responded unrealistically. in the second diner scene he (meekly) tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the order, and in fact turns the gun in his direction, he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation  the very situation he'd been warned about. his response should (would) have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him. there are other faults in the stories but i'll leave it with these two examples. in spite of the writing faults i did like the show.the other problem i had was that i just could not accept eliza dushku in this roll. in my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part. she never walked anywhere, she marched; and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark. she also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation. she either has a pensive look or a cute smile; rarely are other emotions apparent. when she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and 'then' turns her eyes to her fellow actor. or alternatively she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away. both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion. an example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20, "two weddings and a funeral", during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion (eg. hearts in our hearts).i liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. with improved writing and a lead change tru calling might have made it.

eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. she manages to be the rock-steady centre of "tru calling" but that's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity. it's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in "buffy the vampire slayer" to this clunker. unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "tru calling" fails to excite on any level above hormonal. the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city, in order to avert the deaths of good-looking corpses-to-be that she's already met in the mortuary where she works. despite all the running she does, she always arrives looking like she's just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. in every episode, eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland, characterless screenplays but it's a pointless exercise. "tru calling" just lies on the slab, gazing lifelessly at the ceiling.

the brands in this film, like suit supply, take away from the story, cause it's supposed to be set in the eighties. it's not a very thrilling film. also, the single from intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times', like "i'm a cruel man, i take it all away, i'm a cruel man i'm here to stay.." jeeez couldn't those asswipes have come up with something better than that? i guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes..it's really annoying, just like the product placement in this filmproduct,that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be, but should be forgotten like rats ought to be.

after some quite ok dutch action flicks, like lek and van god los, gerrard verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a dutch mobster. well, mobster is a big word for klaas bruinsma. he isn't a real international big guy like george jung (blow) or pablo escobar. he is just an amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. things are often blown up in the netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. but even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told. now there are major jumps in time: one day klaas is just an ordinary drug-boy, the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug-scene. nobody knows how's that possible (except for those who read the book). the acting is really bad, the non-dutch movie-watchers get to see one of the worst actresses in the netherlands: chantal janzen. when you think she finally gets naked, then you are watching a stand in model. so: bad acting + bad montage + crap story = de dominee.please don't watch it, even if other people say it's good, because it isn't. i've warned you.

to begin with, i have to admit i've never been a big fan of the dutch movie-genre. unfortunately watching de dominee hasn't made me change my mind. it shares some common flaws, like having a plot that's too predictable and linear for my taste. worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage-actors in a play. unfortunately this is common too in many dutch movies and, at least to me, makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters.the actor that plays adri (i'm sorry, i forgot his name at the moment) is at least delivering a decent performance, and is one of the reasons i don't rate this movie even worse.another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production seems professional. ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you don't speak dutch,although i already warned you that the plot isn't spectacular either, but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch.

"de dominee" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,klaas bruinsma! in the movie he is called klaas donkers! i have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! but that doesn't really matter! because it failed to grab my attention! this movie bored the crap out of me! it lacks substance and style! the substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action! don't we need to be entertained? it would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! it is obvious that he didn't! otherwise he wouldn't have made this the way he did! this movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding klaas bruinsma and a member of the dutch royal family! this scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever! without it "de dominee" never would have been successful! i am sure of it!

this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended, i was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. no wonder alan moore refused to have anything to do with v for vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.it's not bad in an entertaining way, like showgirls. it's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. plot holes the size of planets. the worst script in memory. horrible acting by decent actors. visuals that should be great, but somehow flop. it could have been so good...

25 august 2003 league of extraordinary gentlemen:sean connery is one of the all time greats and i have been a fan of his since the 1950's. i went to this movie because sean connery was the main actor. i had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. the movie surprised me quite a bit. the scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. in my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery. for me, going to this movie was a waste of my time. i will continue to go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection. but i can't see wasting money to put this movie in my collection

i will be honest and say i gave up on watching it somewhere mid-way and then fast forward with a few breaks. then i came back here and read many of the reviews already made....maybe is just me, and i can not help it, but this cartoon to north american society seems to have a purpose of "lets save them from themselves" and iraq comes to mind right away. it seems to me that this is a justification, or part of, for another invasion with "good intentions".the lady to me seems a self indulged person and i frankly got annoyed at her portrait of trying to raise pity and "feel" for her. well in this case this could never happen because, just like a history teacher has already mentioned here, i need to know how come her family was so wealthy above average, manage to keep that ( were they playing both sides maybe?)and send her to paris!? now, if this would have been made after a poor girl's biography i could see myself having certain emotions. but as it stands + its release timing this is just pure propaganda movie; even worse, since its cartoon, it overplays the "soft" side of tings too well for its own good , in order to possibly be taken serious.besides there are those clichés regarding gays. well, a woman that fights toward winning her rights should not have at least some compassion for the underdogs of society just like her??? the message is obviously self indulgent from the view of a ruling class member.i only give it 2 stars because its production and related stuff. a propaganda movie obviously has interests in convincing-manipulating my thoughts and therefore generally is well done appealing to certain visual emotions that i can not deny i might have as well.

the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. this movie bored me. it was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties. mind you, she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real. she is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran. the only thing i received from this movie was angst.

although allegedly autobiographical, this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as into larger-scale historical processes, and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary iran remained unfulfilled. instead, i found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded islamic villains replaced each other taunting, torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class iranian whose western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks.) the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market, as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies (i.e. a "crowd pleaser"). what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which i do give it some stars.

it starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. but after they transfered to capitalistic country, here it is, czech unofficial but well known mentality ... copying ... copying ... copying of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. i think that this is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "film" and money. and it remains me of the /one flew over the cuckoo's nest/, which can not be compared to this film in the way of art and actors and story and politics. i think this film is boring. it could be done better. at least, they tried. sorry guys. :-( canot not recommend

when jan svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. you're in for dark, harrowing films like "alice" and "little otik," or short gems such as "down to the cellar" and "jabberwocky." all of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.on the other hand, when svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights."lunacy," unfortunately, is very much this latter type of movie. cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper-thin for an appalling two hours. there are a few moments that briefly hold interest, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom.if you found svankmajer's dreadful, monotonous short film "et cetera" brilliant and hilarious, you'll probably love "lunacy." if you've never seen a svankmajer film before, please start elsewhere.

talk about creepy. if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. i don't so i thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in season 3, and the only charles grant craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in season 3. so, overall verdict? just read the summary at the top. this is a strong contender (hell money says hi!) for worst episode of season 3. to be honest though, i hadn't really expected much. i wish i could oubliette this episode altogether. that's one thing they got right: the title.

thank god you're here is painful, positively painful. the title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the marx brothers. and trust me, they are paid.as creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, i refuse to believe that nbc brass really have faith in this turkey. rather, i think thank god you're here is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate studio 60, which previously graced the peacock network's monday night lineup. you want to turn your nose up at caviar, fine. here's some lovely alpo direct from menu foods for you to slop around in.

this show is terrible. i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. this is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. i have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.what the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights. the dumb, completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at. and if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them that it's wrong! i find this show is disgrace to the art, and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway, which had great talent, great improv games, and on top of everything else, didn't make me want to change the channel.

with nbc's "thank god you're here", the network may be trying to replicate the successes of abc's improv sitcom, "who's line is it anyway?" in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some kind. in the nbc show, dave foley and co-host dave alan grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who must improvise their way through various scenes which all begin with "thank god you're here." it takes itself far too seriously (why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before), both co-hosts seem less then enthused. after watching the continuously sub-par, unfunny attempts by the actors to solicit some laughs, i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what transpires, or whether they, too, are improvising. expect this time slot filler to be a very short-lived one.

on the positive, i'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. on the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. long, whiny and pointless. and i'm not saying this to be mean, i really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called "buzz", and was a hassle to track down besides. had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, i believe this would've been amazing. and i expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future, they clearly have the ability. but i recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.

this is the worst movie that i have ever seen. at first i thought that it was going to be good because i'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. all it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.

the bermuda triangle ,we are told in this waste of celluloid, is the portal to another time and dimension and can be crossed using cheap special effects by bad actors spouting inane dialoguei simply was unable to decide who the makers of this excresence thought would be its target audience as it seems impossible anybody could derive even a modicum of pleasure from the outcome avoid-its not even bad enough to be good.

got to confess right up front that i didn't watch this entire movie. i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast. or was i spared the first hour? the other reviewers sum this one up nicely. it was badly conceived. badly scripted. badly acted.but the worst thing for me was the adr. the entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. there was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. and hang. and hang. even a made for tv movie should have recognized this.and the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s, folks.

if you feel like wasting 86 minutes on a film that makes no sense, is badly written ,with a bad plot and bad acting then this little gem is for you. recommended for those who are about to fall asleep. major annoyance will be felt by the awake viewer. do not pay to see this movie!

if you're a north american 'tourist' looking for a 'trap' here it is. was this "trading spaces visits tuscany?" there were way too many stereotypes. little attention was given to character and plot development. yawn. highlight of the film: the flag throwing. poor guy! i thought he was going to loose an eye!

this is just another one of those "american finds romance with charming foreigner in exotic european locale." this genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s, yet they continue to churn them out. i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it. if all you want to see is tuscany, try watching "stealing beauty" with liv tyler - a marginally better movie.this types of genre movies are very hallmark greeting card-ish.

this movie was thoroughly unwholesome, unsettling and unsatisfying. apart from a few nice shots of italy, there's nothing to recommend this movie. as usual, hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence--the _next_ guy you meet, whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours, _he_ must be mr. right. as for humor, there is some in the movie, but i can't see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic _comedy_ since about three-quarters of the movie is totally depressing! my recommendation? skip it in the theaters, wait till it comes out on dvd, then skip it there also. i want someone to give me back the two hours i wasted watching this dreck, drivel, dross.

this movie was supposedly based on a non-fiction book. i'm not sure what book the script writer(s) read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of frances mayes in italy. instead, it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every juncture to bash men. note the following examples:********************************************************************spoiler details********************************************************************bash number one : lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorce.bash number two : lane ventures into a local italian town and is promptly solicited by every male on the street.bash number three : lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen. she falls for him after consummating an afternoon of love making. she later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her.bash number four : you have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie. her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro (sp?) fertilization. i am told that in most lesbian relationships, you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role. in the movie, after the female has been made pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle it.in conclusion, this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on.

the movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest. the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! how can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie, than the movie ends??? maybe part ii will be romantic, but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money! i have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!!

diane lane is beautiful and sexy, and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous. the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving.set in (let's say) a suburb of newark, the plot would be deemed ridiculous. all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano, and a film of the while-the-sun-sinks-slowly-in-the-west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world.

ok i watched this movie. someone needs to kick me. why must the olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture? this was another movie of watching the olsen twins travel to an exotic location, meet some cute guys,look pretty and have everyone drooling over them.the direction,the plot development,ugh the acting. i don't know about the u.s., but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to hop onto the bike of a guy u met like,10 minutes back. though i'm now convinced that these girls will never learn to act, i really hope that one day we'll get to watch a movie with an original,even slightly plausible plot.

the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away? in order to gain some sort of responsibility, which i dont really see the sense in the punishment..., they are sent to paris, far far far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris. i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares? the detail doesnt help, the girls are sent to paris to learn something.. so what exactly do they learn when they meet two french boys and are able to manipulate the guy that supposed to watch them so they can meet these guys on scooters? the typical pre-teen movie, having all pre-teens wishing to misbehave and be able to afford the trip to paris or some far away country away from parents? i dont really like the olsens anyways, they never could really shake off the image of michelle, on full house... in case you didnt see that, then you were lucky from the start. (f f-)

a stupid movie, with a stupid plot. feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender. i especially "liked" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water. because we all know how dedicated america is to conservation of the environment. kyoto, anyone?? and the french chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger... this is why people think americans have no culture. that, and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to europe to "see the world" (i.e. eat at mcdonalds in foreign capitals) they are not as dumb as the two ditsy preteens in this movie, but they have just about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.

i was once a big olsen fan. i received this movie when i was six and watched it almost nonstop until i was nine. then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. i was left speechless.mary-kate and ashley play allie and mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend spring break in paris with their ambassador grandfather. along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute french boys who show them the more fun side to paris. i guess the two boys were okay, fake french accents aside. the plot is predictable and the humour is shallow and corny. mary-kate and ashley play two shallow girls with too much make up on their face. don't watch this movie if you're not into the olsen twins or family movies.

this movie was alright. mary-kate and ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.right away two french boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. blah blah blah. it's an olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. anyway, along with that, the twins meet a fabulous french model because they're in paris, the fashion capital of the world. they make bffs with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the city of lights. yep.plotwise, i frankly can't remember what happened. i guess that could say something, but hey, it's an olsen movie. "olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment".overall, this movie was annoying. i mean, can i really identify at all with two girls who are devastated upon hearing that they're going to paris? really? also, the jokes really weren't that funny. however, i watched the whole movie. so it had to be somewhat entertaining. the fact that it was set in paris was what probably kept me watching.

i have seen this movie and i did not care for this movie anyhow. i would not think about going to paris because i do not like this country and its national capital. i do not like to learn french anyhow because i do not understand their language. why would i go to france when i rather go to germany or the united kingdom? germany and the united kingdom are the nations i tolerate. apparently the olsen twins do not understand the french language just like me. therefore i will not bother the france trip no matter what. i might as well stick to the united kingdom and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. that is all.

one of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. a red-shirt female falls for khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring. we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "wink of an eye", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! same as in ss. (however, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) this is very silly because it once again makes kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. the fact that mcgivers switches back to kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way. lord mcgiveth and the lord mctaketh...why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? that's one of several st plot-devices that undermine kirk's intelligence. why does khan hold a knife against mccoy's throat? if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. and what's with a sikh being played with a latino accent? montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. i was half-expecting to hear "the plaaain! the plaaaain!" in the background at any moment. why the hell would kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone? is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? ss is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder trekkies love it. it doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what trekkies hate the most. it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny trekkie brain.

i saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on tv and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. well, she can have it.look, i can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. but this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from rock hudson and jane wyman. it's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. oh well, they say love is blind...the neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too. and how often did we need otto kruger repeating the title? it happened not once, not twice, but three times!

daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright. except in this case it doesn't. based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas, (he wrote "the robe"), and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight. to make amends he takes up medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (no, it sin't quite that daft; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). in between times, they fall in love.try as i might i can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk's films, (this one isn't too deep). on the plus side rock hudson isn't half bad, (i think i am rediscovering him), and, of course, it looks great, (in sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime tv.

i would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. it is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the hotel del coronado. i know it was on either big bear lake or lake arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. as for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that jane wyman was even nominated for an academy award. this must have been a period when she was well liked by her academy peers. it really would have been interesting to get a true impression from wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script. the script of this movie, like the recent kevin costner movie with a message in a bottle, is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts. rock hudson can be forgiven. he was never a great actor, was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career (pretty maids is the exception). but wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system.

admittedly, the only reason i watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of ian holm; i was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. at any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the old zeff has produced since "jesus of nazareth." but some of the best parts of the play have been left out. i understand the directing/editing choices, but i don't think that it really does justice to the play. perhaps i'm too much a purist. i would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward branagh's version, if it weren't that i despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. all the same, he plays a better hamlet than gibson. but then, weren't we all waiting for gibson to prove himself as an actor? now, all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages....perhaps the only shakespearean-worthy acting here is scofield as the ghost.

franco zeffirelli's ("the taming of the shrew," "romeo and juliet," "jesus of nazareth," "othello") third stab at transferring shakespeare to the screen works very well, with the casting of mel gibson ("mad max," "lethal weapon" and pre-"the passion of the christ" notoriety) in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier (and rightly so; see my review on his "hamlet," arguably the best interpretation of one of the bard's timeless (and most quoted) tragedies) and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a full-bloodied treatment, explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time, combined with a dream cast (and a lot of little additions, which were well-chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare, kenneth branagh, the director of "henry v" and "dead again." joining the "lethal weapon" star are glenn close ("the big chill"), paul scofield ("a man for all seasons"), alan bates, ian holm, michael maloney (who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parker's "othello" (see my review of olivier's "stage" version of the tragedy, though he only starred in it) and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3-hour version of "hamlet" (a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play; see my review on that one as well) 5 years later), nathaniel parker (who would be cast as cassio in his brother's version of "othello" 4 years later) and helena bonham-carter, who would be cast in "mary shelley's frankenstein" 4 years later. zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier (who had died 2 years prior to this movie) and it works pretty well, for the most part. what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene, he gives one of hamlet's lines to the ghost. also, helena bonham-carter did not convince me as ophelia. she was too dull and unreal, whereas jean simmons (who had immortalized the role in olivier's version) and kate winslet (who did an acceptable job in kenneth branagh's uncut, epic revisionist reworking of "hamlet") were good in the role, with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever, that's why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 (she didn't win-what a shame). ian holm said his lines too quickly, not slowly as i expected him to, in a scene with him, laertes and ophelia. but then again, i'm more used to felix aylmer and richard briers' interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of "hamlet" (both done by great directors, actors, text-editors, producers and stars of all their versions of the bard's work) as polonius. the rest of the cast, however, was excellent. the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required. i recommend this version just to pass the time, but it's ideal as a teaching tool for 12th-grade english teachers (i recommend showing olivier's version first, then branagh's and finally this version). despite the film's "pg" rating, there was really nothing objectionable in the movie. only what the play called for. the best versions of "hamlet" are: #1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh. both were so good that i can't decide which one was the best. see my reviews on these versions for more information. #2 franco zeffirelli. this one was alright. it started out alright with a scene not in the play, but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play, where a guard cries out "who's there?" "nay, answer me. stand and unfold yourself!!" that scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then-bam!!, you almost jump out of your skin. in short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play. huge blunder on zeffirelli's part to omit that scene. it also misplaced a lot of lines (and cut others that i think should've been put in), such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia "get thee to a nunnery, why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?"; that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene, not where it was placed in the film (after the "to be or not to be" soliloquy. this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature. kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier, as several of the actors (aside from him) had performed "hamlet" on stage/or on film many times on different occasions. however, zeffirelli's take on "hamlet" is faithful to the play and that's what i was looking for. the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branagh's versions, only that the denouement in branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions (more in line with the play; olivier toned it down...and it worked equally well) and stuck more closely to the play, with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own...to very good effect. this version is not rated.

it is one of the joys of shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances - no single performance can be right', but some can be wrong, and this one is. there are at least two things about hamlet which cannot be dispensed with: 1. his indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action. for god's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does. if you had othello there instead of hamlet, claudius would be dead by the end of act one. any production has to try to explain why hamlet delays, why he is incapable of action. 2. his sexual disgust. his total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with ophelia is impossible. at the slightest hint of sex, hamlet throws up. so, what does mel gibson give us? lusty action-man. you could not get further from the character of hamlet if you tried. there are lots of ways hamlet can be played, but this isn't one of them! what i don't understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts - claudius, polonius and so on, why couldn't they find one to play hamlet as well. mark rylance in the part would have made this a great film. this mel gibson', whoever he is, completely let down the rest of the cast. and lets face it, hamlet without the prince really doesn't work.

well, to each his own, but i thought gibson's hamlet was the most god-awful rendition i had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. the only reason i watched the movie through to the end was that i held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. no luck.no disrespect for the supporting cast or for zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. i have seen hamlet well-portrayed as an african prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. etc. . but imho this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams.

this is by far the worst version of william shakespeare's tragic masterpiece i have ever seen. it seems the filmmakers didn't actually read shakespeare's text. no, they just took what they wanted from the lawerence olivier movie. the plot is out of order and slimmed down to its bare necessity, yet there is time for the non-canon olivier created incest hint between hamlet and queen gertrude. could we have had the "something rotten in the state of denmark" bit instead? casting is another issue. i understand that the far superior branagh movie had its weak bits (robin williams and charlton heston come to mind), but this one has very few good moments. i do like laertes and polonius, but the rest of the cast is stale. mel gibson's creepy stubble is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying. many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part--they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school.if you want a version of hamlet, check out kenneth branagh's or even lawerence olivier. to be frank, even disney's hamlet is better.

it's so depressing when film makers try to be cool and it's so obvious here. this has below average acting, laughable dialogue, split screens that are difficult to watch, and many goofs in it's attempt to be a period film and autobiographical. this film should be avoided at all costs. i was told not to go and see this film. i wish i had listened.

when i voted my "1" for this film i noticed that 75 people voted the same out of 146 total votes. that means that half the people that voted for this film feel it's truly terrible. i saw this not long ago at a film festival and i was really unimpressed by it's poor execution. the cinematography is unwatchable, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other movies, and the acting is dreadful. this movie is basically a poor rip-off of three other films. no wonder this was never released in the usa.

this movie was so frustrating to watch. the split screens don't allow you to get very involved in the emotions of the actors. i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with wiplash by the end. this is basically a rip off of "the talented mr. ripley" and "timecode" i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool. i wish i had walked out like so many other people did.

i saw this film without knowing much about it at all. the split screen device was immediately irritating, and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence had finished. the plot, characters and dialogue were all extremely cliched - poor guy from abusive family gets thrown out of home, wants to get out of his 'lot', reinvents himself, changes his voice, dresses in others' clothes, is adopted by a gay man who he proceeds to disgard on his way up to becoming part of an international set of drug taking british aristocrats.the estate of patricia highsmith (talented mr ripley) should be suing the makers of this film. the triple screen to me, together with the over 120 min duration, emphasises the almost non existent editing. can't decide which image works and is the most powerful, why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them. this gimmick removed any connection or interest i had with any of the characters. important dialogue was repeated 3 times across each screen, as if to say 'this is an important / moving / deep moment, ok!'.don't waste your time.

i was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in sydney. i left the theater, like many others, before the end credits because i couldn't sit through it any longer. it was badly shot, the sound sucks, and the acting was worse than an episode of the love boat. now i know why this film hasn't been able to find an american distribution company to release it in the united states. this screams of a low budget high school production.

what can i say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the uk. i can only imagine the likes of diana quick and georgina hale, needed the money. what story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. it's supposed to be based on real life events. well, all i can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. the dvd is out at the moment in the uk. it's available in either the split screen format, which must make it even worse that the full screen version i watch. gay cinema can be so much better than this, and we deserve more.

what a self-indulgent mess! duncan roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco.in a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused, working class lad to criminal english lord. however, the tone is either so self-pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot. the raw material is potentially great stuff, however roy seems unable to tease out the kind of tale that should grab you by the throat, then move you to tears. and it's a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a triptych of images - presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watch.it's also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors - bill nighy, diana quick, lindsay coulson - giving career-worst performances.

i was very interested in seeing this movie despite the article i read about the director in tattler magazine. i don't judge movies by what the director may or may not have done. this debut feature was very difficult to watch. i found the split screens to be a distraction to the drama in the film, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances, and the film to be a copy of several other films i have seen. there really wasn't anything fresh about this

i'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising a.k.a. not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate. afraid i'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. great idea, shame about the execution. and it was most disconcerting to watch so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones including the leaden lead) all apparently thinking that they were appearing in a series of very different films. i wish that a.k.a. had been audacious, innovative or just simply interesting. sadly it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with arty aspirations. a missed opportunity.

unlike one of the reviewers below, i don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. whereas it is good to see a british director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, aka's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. at first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex. if you can forget the triple screen (which, granted, is very hard to do), you then have to deal with the unintentionally hilarious script. the audience is beaten into submission by chiche upon chiche about the british class system. the film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of upstairs and downstairs. to sum up: the emperor's new clothes. and a rather poor outfit, too.

aka aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78:1 within 2.39:1 frame (triptych) sound format: dolby digital1978: a working class teenager (matthew leitch) assumes a false identity and gatecrashes high society, where he learns harsh lessons about the divisions between rich and poor.autobiographical feature by director duncan roy (jackson: my life... your fault), an exposé of the pre-thatcherite aristocracy, as seen through the eyes of a low-rent 'commoner' whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the upper classes. unfortunately, roy's screenplay says very little we didn't already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly ignited by leitch's relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent boy (peter youngblood hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate. also starring diana quick (as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are "embarrassed to be alive"!), bill nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, lindsay coulson ("eastenders"), blake ritson (different for girls) and georgina hale in a typically flamboyant cameo, flashing her boobs at all and sundry, without a care in the world! unfortunately, much of the film's impact is diluted by roy's insistence on using a triptych effect (three separate 1.78:1 images are letterboxed within the 2.39:1 frame, each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes), which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on-screen. a long, pointless film, too personal for wide appeal, and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand. a single-image version is also available (framed theatrically at 1.85:1), with the on-screen title aka: lies are like wishes.

duncan roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. actually it sort of stinks. aka is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of dorian gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good. diana quick must be cringing with embarrassment. dr you should just get out of film...seriously.

as a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, too, i cannot see the movie as a movie, only. as a movie is has some great, wonderful shots of the ship, most of them done on an existing vessel - apart of the ones in the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room under deck. but regarding the story and dialogs i only can call it big crap. nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel. no wonder, the film had bad impact on the existing ship - if i didn't know better, i wasn't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure. definitely, for europeans i recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground. after that, the over-emotional, very american part begins which i couldn't bear. the pics are really, really great, no wonder in a ridley scott film, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will become much better.

the story, as i understand, is "based on real events." that can be either good or bad, depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered.in this case, the results are enough to gag a maggot. i wasn't expecting much going in -- anticipating a story of rich high-school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper. that is, what i figured was a coming-of-age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training, the kind in which the drill sergeant says, "my duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways." well, it is that, in a way. the kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group. but this is far hokier than any boot-camp movie i've ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. who wrote this thing? the air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third grade. the dialog offends the ear.jeff bridges usually does a better-than-average job but in this case his performance is mediocre. he brings nothing extra to the part, although given his lines, it's hard to know how he could do much with them. the rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate. there's a lot of tearing up, and considerable crying. the best scene involves a dolphin.the immature clichés continue to the very end. the coast guard is cast in the role of the hard-hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster. the interrogator does nothing but hit bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events. "you let the crew drink alcohol, didn't you?" (a couple of harmless drinks.) "and you didn't punish them, though you punished them for killing a fish." (the dolphin business.) the technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky. what is a "white squall" anyway? and if it's as dangerous as bridges claims, why weren't the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests? but why go on? if "the albatross" were a dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comic-book script.

lois weber's film "hypocrites" was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film. i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it. the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth, after failing to lead them to it and the few that did, help along the way. the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong, but it shows them putting things before god, going to beach parties acting inappropriate, their materialistic ways, and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right. in the end, failing to gain any followers, he must enter into the gates of heaven alone. this film seems to me to be very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it, especially considering the time period in which this film was made. the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible. the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path, each with different excuses, setbacks, and/or higher priorities, was a great way of representing the people of today. this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience. lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity, symbolism, visuals, and through auditory. even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme.

the worst movie i've seen in a long time. this whole thing rings false, and the billy crudup character especially so. the potential for a good story is there, but this movie never comes close to delivering. every plot element just drifts away.

the reviewer in variety said this was "overwritten and overlong", and i kind of agree with it. it has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when cal (crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place. the story is one of those 1970's "guy must find meaning in his life" stories, and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal. the whole "hitting the road to find meaning in life" theme is still kind of interesting though. does it all really lead back to family? i wasn't so sure. the acting is okay, i particularly liked karen allen and james legross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. i'd give it a 'five'.

i am one of those people that respect every film-maker as having achieved, each film i watch i usually respect(although i admit i select carefully) and appriciate for what it is. not any more. this is truly one of the worst scripts i have seen produced as a film...so much so i felt compelled to warn others off it. the dialogue was truly unbelievable, the main protaganist was about the last person i would be interested in finding out more about. a scene were an old school friend 'tells it like it is' made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already concluded plot. the direction is glib at best and at worst film-making by numbers. to compare this film to the atmospheric majesty of a film like five easy pieces is a travesty.

this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women,the universe,the better life,the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from manhattan who severs all links with everyone,including his three years old child -which may seem irresponsible to some-actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal ,which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie.the scene with-the-father-who-left-home-when -i-was-a child has been told and told and told.of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life.and when you see the hero's wife's attitude ,you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib.the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson,tom waits or bonnie raitt...but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work.

this film was so unfocused, rambling and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing. (i actually thought some interesting plot elements might develop.) this was nothing more than a "coming-of-age" film for the thirty-something generation. total crap and i have no idea what julianne moore was doing in this since it was the only reason i picked it off the shelf at the rental store.

what a waste of talent -- although it appears that crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid, self- absorbed, character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie.in art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. what this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory/competing, unresolved impulses/consciousness of the film's director/writer. it unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved, deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy or the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience. but this film fails on either level in that regard.the fact that cal, the main character (very much an antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone, especially those most deserving of it (which does not include him) and that he has such overblown, entitled, self-pitying, whiney sympathy only for himself, combined with the hallmark lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others -- all converge in this film to make him the epitome of the self-involved, developmentally arrested, narcissistic sociopath -- somehow this is now the gold standard for males on film and in the world at this point and time. one of his counterpoints (james legros) states with a laser-true flash: "i bet you haven't done one good thing in life -- and i bet you won't". it captures the absolute essence of the cal character. something the other characters he bulldozes over in the film seem to realize fairly quickly despite the director having stacked the deck to manipulate sympathy for cal. that is a testament to the supporting cast's talent and skills.cal's eventual 'return' has nothing to do with character development, transformation or evolution of consciousness. it has only to do with the ultimate capitulation that until something better comes along, he may as well be back in his comfy cozy status quo of entitled enablement where the living is easy and no one will demand that he grow up--something of which he is willfully incapable and uninterested in doing.the film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and tragedies -- the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience/ consciousness, but it excuses and glorifies it instead -- in fact, it wallows in self-pity right along with the arrogant, selfish, emotionally stunted main character.(and it sure sent chills up my spine when thinking of the recent revelations about convicted murderer scott peterson).if you want to see crudup at his most nuanced and full of an exciting potential that has never been truly realized in my opinion, see the underrated 'inventing the abbotts' ....

the other is a supposed "horror" movie made during the 1970s. it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others, which starred nicole kidman.the plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as "the game". one of these twin boys - niles - is supposed to be "good". the other one - holland - is supposed to be evil.the idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel. i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end.the execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5. in fact, this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel. a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a u-rated movie of the kind disney produce. but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the other.you don't need to check out the director's cv to realise horror is not his forte.mr. mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story. this is obvious from the get-go. i haven't seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site. unfortunately in the other, the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expect.the direction is as bland as you could possibly find. almost every single scene takes place in the daytime! think about this - a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area. does it sound scary or atmospheric? believe me, it isn't. it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie. and yes, both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in california.there is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless.the ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period. i won't reveal which movie but i'll give 2 clues - a young boy was a main character and the movie is well-known. and i'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie.the acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars. the actors playing the twin boys, along with the actress playing the grandmother, all try hard with the poor material they are given.diana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys. do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list. she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cash-in on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewers.i paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover (of the region 2 version in the uk). comparisons were made to the exorcist, which i thought was a complete insult to that movie. there is no comparison. the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not - suspense, tension, tongue-in-cheek humour, highly disturbing content, great acting, superb characterisation and viewer involvement. ironically, the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other. the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s!the 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist, the omen, the texas chainsaw massacre, the legend of hell house, salem's lot to name just a few being produced. for this reason, the other proves an even greater disappointment.if anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting, they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about. i would advice everyone to skip the movie.

i rented this movie primarily because it had meg ryan in it, and i was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one. not only is she not on screen much, but nothing her character does is essential to the plot. her character could be written out of the story without changing it much.

"d.o.a." is a non-thrilling thriller from directors rocky morton and annabeljankel. the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad. this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violenceare. for example, someone is shot near a window. we then see from outsidethe building what looks like that person jumped. i laughed my head off when this happened. this movie tries hard, but ultimately fails. only watch this moviewhen you have no other choice.my critique: **rating: [r]rating reasons: violence and language.**there was no rating reason available due to its age.

the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. i've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.the acting's all good and the direction very solid. the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. did bugsy really want to kill mussoulini?

it goes without saying that a modicum of allowances has to be made when a true story is being adapted for the big screen. but if you shoot a fairy tale that has next to nothing to do with what actually happened - why call it bugsy and make the audience believe this was a halfway true story? the godfather trilogy processes many real characters and events, once upon a time in america does it, too, but they don't claim to be telling true stories.* spoiler*in the movie, benny has this grand vision of a gambler's eldorado; in real life lansky had to argue him into going to nevada. benny deemed the notion of a counterpart to monte carlo idiotic, and he'd have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in l.a. not until much later benny warmed to the idea. but of course he's the hero of the movie, so naturally the idea had to be his.in the movie, benny wants to use count difrasso to get close to mussolini in order to assassinate him because he was hitler's partner, and hitler killed jews in gas chambers, after all. obviously we're supposed to like benny, so the screenwriters invented this nonsense. in real life, at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers, least of all benny who was completely uninterested in politics. in fact he did use the countess' connection and he did visit mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell explosives to him. he even met goebbels and goering during his sojourn in italy.the whole greenberg subplot was nonsense. greenberg didn't turn stool pigeon, he didn't seek refuge with benny, benny didn't kill him (that was up to albert tannenbaum)... at least they got the name right.i guess it was supposed to be very romantic to have virginia return to benny, offering him the money she had stolen. the movie even goes so far to tell us via text panels that she ruefully returned the money to lansky after benny's assassination. let me just say, revisionism just doesn't get more impudent than this.this list is by no means exhaustive - there's the issue with benny's family not living in l.a, the way benny deals with dragna and adonis, the portrayal of costello (a disagreeable corporate type), lansky (a lovable teddy bear), benny himself (an aging windbag who wouldn't have reached age 12 if he had regularly gone "bugsy" in situations like those in the movie, and what's more, who neither has the good looks nor the charisma of benny siegel) and many others. apart from a few hard facts nothing's right in this flick.* spoilers end here*all in all, this is the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than harlem, ny. but honor where honor is due: this is a feat in itself.

it`s funny how instinct warns you of something . for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was . maybe i`m psychic ?!!!! mild spoilers !!!!the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . i don`t know about you but i`m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it`s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? yeah he`s a serious badass mofo . in fact he`s so bad ( and i don`t mean the acting - i`ll get to that in a moment ) that he`s impossible to take seriously and this is before he`s executed only to return as elton john , elvis , a french chef etc . i wonder if keith david got paid for this ? because he looks lke he`s having so much fun on screen that`s the only reason he`s playing the role . what a pity this reviewer didn`t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury . hey maybe the producers could send me keith`s fee ? gawd only knows i deserve it.i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn`t guessed and my main beef isn`t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . if like me you`ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you`ll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but judge and jury will have you believe that if you`re thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you`ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . it could of course be argued that any film starring sly , arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain

i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, i gave it an extra star just because david keith's gun was cool.

so much for judge and jury, which lives up to its nonsense title. what good is there? the lighting is terribly foggy! another horror movie you ask? well, that's perfectly explainable. david keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns, chefs, and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row. but overall, despite some new twists, it's reasonably stupid. unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently, and this one only means so much. we, the jury, find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time!

if this is not heavily featured on every list of "what not to watch", it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as that remains so, is the acceptable alternative. i'm not kidding you, this is a *bad* "movie". joseph meeker returns from the dead, with various vague, undefined supernatural powers, the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new, increasingly comical-looking and ridiculous(and never scary or creepy... in general, when this goes for the latter of those, it winds up just being bizarre, and attempts at the former just don't work, period) outfits and stereotypes/archetypes, and he is portrayed by david keith(whom i respect in... well, at least daredevil), doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent(which could also have to do with script) and often over the top performance. a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch. the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is(and what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks?). cinematography... oh, dear. framing, coverage, effective use of angle(that one could be attributed some to editing, too, perhaps), please, guys, stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of. as far as the technical side goes, this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film. but why stop there? the plot is just poor. the basic idea's been done, and it's been done so much better than this(the crow would be one). the way it's told is gimmicky, and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks, it still doesn't satisfy. pacing is about non-existent. the lead is distinctly unlikeable, and there's more personality in a barn door, not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden. kelly perine and thomas ian nicholas? what in the name of all that is good and just(pun intended) are you doing in this? perine, you were already funny before this, on the drew carey show, nicholas, well, i haven't seen you in anything preceding american pie, but if nothing else, you *were* funny later on, and in those productions, the amusement was intentional. dialog is... the less said, the better. language is unrestrained, and tends to be stupid. the violence is shoddily done, and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it(hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy). characters, don't get me started. why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting, at times utterly illogical, events? the more you think about this, the worse it gets. it's not even passable as a "bad horror flick", or a b movie(it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet, and go further still), it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine. i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is, and don't say i didn't warn ya. 1/10

before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called "bloody shootout" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls "a hamburger without the fries"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano's life a misery.let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife.director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.

well, i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival. the reaction to it was...let's say as funny as the movie unintetionally is. it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles. they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish. it was all confusing, the genders were switched (girls appeared as boys and boys as girls), and my friends and i remember great lines... but because they were so absurd. all in all not a good movie, but if they ever show it on tv, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie) then go ahead, "visible secret" is your film.

possible spoilers --i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan. i was looking forward to seeing them together, being married and all, i wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. okay, that being said, i guess the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship didn't have to permeate their performances, especially with this script.how stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone. i don't remember the original, but i can only assume that o'brien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady, probably in a more inevitable way. if i were "bonded" to someone i'd be pretty angry. the crush i would have would definitely have dissipated quickly. meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise. dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. that whole section of the movie was so horrible -- especially meg having to go to the bathroom (#2) between dumpsters in the dark at night. ewww. no f****ing way! what's with dennis socking every single suspect in the movie. sock first ask questions later. not once, not twice but too many times -- i could have kept count if i were so inclined. the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama. too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot. the assumed off-screen drama leading up to this tragedy. i think it could have been written in without distracting from dex' quest. my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay. unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable.i won't even get into the real reason poor dex was murdered. how ludicrous is that. even when dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained, (a true "film noir" moment) everyone on screen seemed bored. oh, _____ happened. oh. (yawn) "dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder. oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon.if anyone but dennis had been in this movie, i'd have to give it 1/2 star (only because i really have seen worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars.for dennis and meg stars, see anything else.

what i miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said. it is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary. a patchwork film without a continuous story. very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. i do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny. many scenes are very unrealistic, and the acting is quite poor. the film is quite boring.

this very forced attempt to fuse robert altman and quentin tarantino (who is wildly overrated himself) is neither informative nor entertaining. the character development is arbitrary and unbelievable -- especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy, as other reviewers have noted. also, a couple of humorous moments aside, the film is not as funny (black humor or otherwise) as the director seems to think it is.

i had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 due to the terrible sound track. i'm pretty sure it was not a problem with me or the tape, because some actors and the sound track sounded great. but most of the actors voices were distorted or garbled beyond recognition, especially for non-brits.there are plenty of cute little twists that would make this an enjoyable movie - ending up in bosnia by mistake is great - but much of the humor was lost in the sound.

as i write this in november 2005 i've become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler - a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . let's have a look at what the brits were producing 1995-2005:funky gangster thrillers . lock stock and two smoking barrales was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy ritchie's style with usually disappointing results romantic comedies . yeah okay i do realise four weddings , notting hill etc were produced by american studios but they're still vaguely " british films " . unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the umpteenth time black comedies . can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is ? in the british context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike leigh's naked jasmin disdar's beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie . filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a serb and one's a croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the balkans at that time , though what's the odds of two former enemies in the balkans bumping into each other on a london bus ? this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie - irony takes precedence over likely situations , you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely ? perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film . it's called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clichéd stereotypical people that i couldn't believe in as three dimensional characters

old bat transforms to younger ok looking girl after drinking a potion. this movie was dreadful. the acting atrocious. the camera work made me head spin. and it features the longest, most excruciatingly boring strip-tease ever put to film. piero vivarelli should be ashamed for directing this. eduardo manzanos brochero should'voe been blacklisted just for writing something so awful.don't rent this movie, the only exception i can this of is maybe if you're dying and only have less then 90 minutes to live, watch this film cause it will feel like an eternity and you'll be begging the grip reaper come a little early.my grade: f

dr. marnie bannister (magda konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. when one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. when she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. the drug works and she becomes beautiful. but the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.have you ever heard the expression "as exciting as watching paint dry"? that pretty much sums up satanik. during the film, one of the characters utters the line, "something so horrible, it's inconceivable." i wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself. i'm really disappointed because i had high hopes for this one. satanik had possibilities, but they're never realized. at every opportunity, the plot has marnie do the dullest things imaginable. the writing is horrible. and part of the problem is magda konopka. she's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own.another big problem with satanik is the direction and editing. it's a mess. we see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie. the camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over. i can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. this group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent.i may not be familiar with the italian comic on which satanik is supposedly based, but i'm sure it's got to be better than this.

deformed, aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal formulae for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process. she takes it and turns into the beautiful, evil satanik (magda konopka) who goes around, seducing and murdering wealthy businessmen.she dresses very stylishly in late-60s mod clothes and manipulates those around her, looking a lot like the late marisa mell from the diabolik film. coincidence??however, in spite of all this, it's amateurish and sloppy without the james bond pop-art gadgetry that diabolik had had. even the madrid and lake geneva filming locations don't make up for this.the soundtrack is by manuel parada & roberto pregadio and it isn't bad at all, consisting of lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an embellishment. perfect for one of those european loungecore cds that came out in the 90s.the retromedia dvd also uses a substandard grainy color print that's in poor shape, with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film. bull ! they either didn't bother looking for a better source or they couldn't find one at all. there are only a few stills of magda and that's it.sloppy & poor all around, this one gets a 3 out of 10.

this spanish-italian co-production tells an interesting and weird story about dr. bannister, a woman that not only has the best years behind her, but also has a scarred face that makes her look like a freak. but in madrid, a professor she knows has conducted some experiments on animals with a substance which regenerates cells. the experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. because the professor won't allow dr. bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. she becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious killer when it comes to keep her secret a secret.the plot of the film is great fun, but piero vivarelli had not enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it. also, the film becomes boring after a good start and doesn't manage to regain a fast pace even though the film's running time doesn't exceed 83 minutes. and as the setting changes to swiss city geneva for the last third of the film, it sometimes even looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful geneva is (which it is indeed - but it doesn't help to push the plot forward...). so, with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "satanik" could have become an obscure italian classic. but, as it is, it's just a lacklustre and boring crime film that isn't really worth looking for. rating: 3 out of 10.

this review contains a partial spoiler.shallow from the outset, 'd.o.a.' at least starts as if it might be a slick, entertaining piece of nonsense like fincher's 'the game'. it's central character(dennis quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. but the plot rattles along at too great a pace, leading to a dramatic twist not half way through, when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. and this, simply, is too big a twist to add casually to a story. once this has happened, the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal, indeed, its only subject matter: but 'd.o.a.' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. the problem is two-fold: firstly, quaid's actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly, even if they did convince, it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved. the rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort, but made more tedious than usual by the character's slightly-treated predicament, which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in. dennis quaid, in the lead role, doesn't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die: meg ryan is, as often, ditzy and annoying. another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack. watch 'the game' instead, which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven, whereas 'd.o.a.' drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise. as the premise is itself quite intriguing, it's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot.

interesting plot but painfully dull. the script lacks... lacks acting. to me this film compares with "made for tv" type movies. i was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn. i watched this film with my family. it is fairly safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene)if you wish to see a young meg ryan...check out this movie. very 80-ish. you will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at christmas, booze, super glue and tar. or maybe you are like me... and have have a higher standard for acting in films. however i did like the way the movie began and ended! mark.

a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor, "gold diggers of 1933." the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film's release, so the humour is all of the hokey, wocka-wocka variety and gone are the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film. a cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through the motions here, and the "puttin' on a show" motif seems awfully forced; instead of the make or break world of broadway, the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel. who really cares whether or not the show goes on? the score here is bland too. of course the movie's big number is "lullaby of broadway," which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialite's eventual demise from too much partying--doesn't exactly have the same effect as the searing "forgotten man" number used as the finale in '33. busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film, and whatever promise is built up in the film's fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates. unfortunately, no one learned any lessons from this, and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later.grade: c-

after his widower father dies in a horsing accident, young tom burlinson (as jim craig) is left to manage his australian "snowy river" farm, with only wizened, peg-legged prospector kirk douglas (as spur) to help. times are hard, so mr. burlinson goes to work for mr. douglas' wealthy, silver-haired brother rancher "mr. harrison" (also played by kirk douglas). when a big job comes up, the silver-haired (older?) douglas feels burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go along; so, burlinson stays behind, and falls in love with the boss' daughter, sigrid thornton (as jessica harrison).the least satisfactory aspect of director george miller's "the man from snowy river" is a weak storyline. observe, for example, the "jessica is lost" sequence of events. the damsel gets lost in one of those "freak" storms, while running away. her worried father rounds up a posses of drunk men to find her, after predicting bad weather. damsel "jessica" rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff. father and the suddenly sober men don't check burlinson's farm. hero burlinson discovers the damsel. after building a fire, he decides to kiss her.the "romance" is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as burlinson and ms. thornton. to make matters worse, the douglas brothers have a "dark history" which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter. the main attraction, herein, is the australian scenery.**** the man from snowy river (1982) george miller ~ tom burlinson, kirk douglas, sigrid thornton

dreadful! a friend of mine (who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour) recommended this.it's bobbins. i almost switched it off. it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so.this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business. i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie. less funny than global warming.i'm not normally so vehement, but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive.puerile, plot less, useless tosh.i'd rather eat my feet than watch it again.

...and i bought a vampire motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like norman j.warren's inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like kent bateman's headless eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. a lot of people think troma's terror firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but i'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck. then there's john carpenter's dark star. yes, it's quaint, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film it's only two notches above worthless. this no-budget british black comedy-horror outing tries to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to its fellow shoestring splatter flicks (among them psychomania, horror hospital and pretty much anything by pete walker), but due to dismal performances by second-string tv actors (the leading lady looks like amy winehouse), a script that appears to have been written on the back of a peeled beermat by two 'lads' with no understanding of how film comedy works, dean friedman's (intentionally?) dire elevator-rock soundtrack and production values never rising above mediocre, the net result is a film that can only be laughed at, rather than with. if your idea of whoopee is anthropomorphic turds, chinese takeaways called fu king and references to long-forgotten tv ads, you'll enjoy this one, but don't expect too much.

the plot here is simple. country boy, lem (farrell) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, kate (duncan) and marries her, bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman-hungry reapers. there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here. the courtship, taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant, consume the first half hour and are lethargically paced. lem is so weak he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is propositioned by mac (richard alexander) , one of the reapers, to come away with him. duncan and alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler, which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from murnau. farrell's character has no backbone so we wind up rooting for a "real man" (mac) to take kate away from it all. with audience sympathy skewed, the film loses its narrative progression. the father's conversion at film's end is unrealistic and unbelievable, making for a contrived denouement. this film is for fans of the stars and the director only - general audiences need not bother.

***big spoilers!*** "flesh feast" of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great veronica lake's career. this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker, and rightly so, i must say. as a huge fan of low-budget horror/exploitation, especially from the 70s, i nonetheless chose to watch this, mainly due to the cool camp-looking picture on this site, but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film. the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled 'flesh feast' containing four films, including sergio martino's "mountain of the cannibal god" and dal tenney's "i eat your skin". what the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "flesh feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite tedious, which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long. also, don't get fooled by the title, the film is not gory at all. yet it is watchable, if only for its trashiness and, especially, the extremely stupid, but therefore somewhat entertaining ending. the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesh-eating maggots (don't ask how). a bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a 'mysterious' commander. after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself. it was quite obvious before, but i still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious... this is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like veronika lake. except for lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero-budget production like this. bad performances, however, are something i can easily forgive in films like this one. what i can not forgive, though, is extreme boredom. the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff, but i would still recommend to skip it.

flesh feast starts at miami airport, ace reporter dan carter (harry kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate ed casey (phil philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from south america where he has been investigating carl schuman (doug foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. schuman meets dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans. the news of cater's death has reached casey & he decides to take the story up himself & do some investigating, well actually he gets his secretary viginia day (marth mischon) to do most of the investigating & just report back to him, lazy bugger. virginia informs casey that they have someone on the inside named kristine (heather hughes) since dr. frederick rents her spare rooms out to nurses, kristine reports back to casey about schuman & dr. frederick's grotesque youth restoration experiments involving human flesh & specially cultivated maggots...co written, co-produced & directed by brad f. grinter flesh feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts. first lets start with the script by grinter & thomas casey who was also responsible for the cinematography (you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job), basically it's terrible. the character's are one dimensional idiots & have no personality, i didn't like anyone in this film. for what it's worth i quite like some of the ideas here, the flesh-eating maggots, the basement laboratory, stealing bodies from a hospital & that unforgettable 'twist' ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own. unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written, stiff & unnatural sounding it's untrue, i mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they "won't let us out of the house" which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking outside in the garden to someone. no thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh-eating maggots are able to restore youth, in fact at one point near the end when questioned about this very thing dr. frederick claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either! even at an extremely short 68 minutes long flesh feast is very slow & dull, the poor editing doesn't help with scenes & shots lasting for far too long, for example there is a scene in which an ambulance pulls up outside a hospital, drives up to the doors, the guy gets out, he walks to the back doors & opens them etc. etc. did we really need to see every single detail? there is also another sequence in which dr. frederick enters room & puts some gloves on, then she takes them off walks into the opposite room & puts another pair on! i personally think that grinter probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up. i do like that bizarre ending though, i really do. technically flesh feast is complete crap, i'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small, very small. just about the entire film takes place in one house, dr. frederick's laboratory consists of a table, some plastic beakers & test tubes, some ancient looking electronic medical equipment & a strange screen with funny colours on it (don't ask). the cinematography is poor, the music sucks & the entire film looks dubbed, badly dubbed too. the exploitation elements are also disappointing, there are a few maggot shots but they don't actually do anything other than wriggle a bit, there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg sawn off & a ok looking dismembered corpse & limbs hanging on hooks. the acting is awful from everyone concerned, & i mean really bad which makes the rubbishy dialogue even worse. do yourself a favour & avoid flesh feast, yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments & that ending is, well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film-making that quickly becomes painful to watch. i doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting, i can tolerate just about anything but even i considered switching it off. definitely one to avoid, you'll be pleased you did & if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned!

once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named veronica lake. a beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, hollywood pictures. fast forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. now a hasbeen, miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(?), joan crawford, and bette davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable horror. but flesh feast? really? she couldn't have possibly been that washed up. to put it delicately, flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage, possibly one of the top 5 worst films i've ever seen, and i've seen them all. lake plays a scientist, who is plotting, with nazi's, to bring hitler back to life, with youth restoration experiments involving maggots, that's right, maggots. unless you're a huge fan of heather hughes, run away and never look back!! i know very little about this veronica lake person, as well as 40's flicks, but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal, is actually pretty sad. flesh feast is almost impossible to get through, and by almost, i mean absolutely. directed by brad grinter, director of nudist camp pictures, and the man who, coincidentally brought us the greatest b-movie ever made, blood freak, just a couple years later. one has to wonder, is this what blood freak would have been like if grinter hadn't co-directed with steve hawkes? if so, then god bless steve hawkes. you wouldn't think that a religious, dope-blood craving, turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving maggots and hitler, but it really, really is. so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. fast forward a couple years later, veronica lake dies of hepititas, broke, and forgotten. the end. i hate you, flesh feast. 1/10

in the 1940s, veronica lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. she starred opposite big names like alan ladd and fredric march, scoring screen successes in films like "this gun for hire" and "i married a witch". she held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in "so proudly we hail". but changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over. with two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future) veronica headed for new york city, where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight. it was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties. but by now, her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks. without them, public interest in her soon faded again. she did return to the stage in assorted vehicles, but her success was minimal. eventually, she relocated to miami, florida, where she lived in relative obscurity. in 1966 she went to canada for a part in an obscure movie called "footsteps in the snow" which had no u.s. release. the following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature. they approached her to star in their film "time is terror" and convinced her to invest in the project. as one author put it, "if ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown, this was it". surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values, she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this miami, florida shot quickie. looking utterly ordinary in long shots, and luridly aged in close-ups, poor veronica didn't act so much as walk through her part. as a deranged doctor, who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula, using flesh-eating maggots!, she looks both bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad-lib while she struggles gamefully to don a pair of rubber gloves. the supporting cast is no help at all, merely advancing the plot by talking it to death. director brad grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them, no need for anything resembling entertainment (there is, admittedly, one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective/nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that predates ''weekend at bernie's'' by almost 20 years.) according to veronica herself, the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed. but in 1970, the production company scraped it together, changed the title to "flesh feast", and released it to cash in on lake's just published biography. and, because former leading ladies such as bette davis, joan crawford and olivia de havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies, this travesty was promoted as veronica's "comeback film". this seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue, though, because it's unlikely that the (young) audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who veronica lake was. as expected, it did nothing for veronica's career, and she died in poverty, three years later. a previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory (overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) enlists the help of a multi-talented chauffeur to cut up the body parts. "poor mrs. lustig," she sighs, "i hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science." "try not to think about it," advises the chauffeur, sawing away. "i guess you are right, hans." concludes the detective/nurse, "what is done is done." what a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star.

since i was just finishing the book, `mrs. dalloway' by virginia woolf, i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. what i encountered, however, is a film that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensical. one cannot entirely blame the film, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is virginia woolf, and is almost entirely written in stream-of-conscience style with extended periods of internalizing and little actual dialogue, one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it. vanessa redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor do any of the other actors. it is just simply a film that could not intelligibly be made from the story that woolfe wrote, and should not have even been attempted. don't watch the movie, read the book. --shelly

i kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. it just meandered along to the end. none of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. it was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine. if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it certainly is well-hidden or i am very dense, which i doubt.

i couldn't believe this was the same director as antonia's line.this film has it all, a boring plot, disjointed flashbacks, a subplot that has nothing to do with the main plot what so ever, and totally uninteresting characters. it was painful to watch. soooo, painful.

a pig-tailed linnea quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex. she goes to an asylum, makes a best friend out of amy (karen russell) and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "carol burnett show" regular lyle waggoner). on the outside, these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they're systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved, leather-clad mystery killer.the hideous david barton fx are so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality. same goes for the movie. the dialogue is so strange and stilted, the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly, you'll start to doubt your own sanity. this film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script! and like any good bergman film, this has a mature moral to abide by--any good party needs a proper guy/girl "ratio," so there will be enough chicks to "tickle your lizard." see it for yourself... or don't!linnea (the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with) is very amusing in this one, has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes. unfortunately, she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it.score: 3 out of 10

preposterous twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateurish and inept way -- or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and much more combine with walter pidgeon's bovine attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz lang's other stupendous failures. (i thought the german ambassador was actually played by lang but apparently not -- they could have been twins.) if you cannot predict the ending from several timezones away, you are not actually alive.i was eagerly awaiting this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap (even with george sanders and john carradine -- maybe i can wash my mind out by watching viaggio in italia instead and for the umpteenth time).anyone want a dvd used once? (there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely.)

essentially a undistinguished b-movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era's major talents, fritz lang. even with the stellar names of lang, walter pidgeon, joan bennett and george sanders, be prepared for a ludicrous storyline, bad acting, patently phony sets and miscasting. for transparency sake, i have to admit i am an ardent non-admirer of walter pidgeon, who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream-factory of mgm, and somehow worked in secondary roles, supporting greer garson and others. he is wildly miscast, acting in a chipper, '30s-ray milland madcap comedy tone, in a role where his life is in danger, and he is in hiding. joan bennett's cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street-wise cockney slum-girl. george sanders is incapable of bad acting, but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler. surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone. i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense-thriller surrounded by light-hearted comedic interplay. hitchcock totally reversed the ratio, using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense. there is a reason this film is unknown. it didn't serve or propel anybody's career or reputation, and is forgotten because it's a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group.

disappointing film with walter pidgeon as a hunter who goes to germany to assassinate hitler. when he is discovered, he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from england. his refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film.pidgeon is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his cohort, john carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.along the way of being pursued, pidgeon meets up with joan bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent.the story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach world war 11, realism becomes the object of the day.the near-ending scene in the cave between sanders and pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to.very interesting that while pidgeon is fleeing nazi germany, he meets up again with a young roddy mcdowall, one of pidgeon's many co-stars that same year in the memorable "how green was my valley." how green was "man hunt?"

i am assuming that the rave reviews on this page were from people who have never read the book - unfortunately for those of us who love the text, hollywood outdid itself on destroying this one.i am not sure where on earth the woman love-interest came from, except that she replaced the cat, nor why our rogue male acquired a helpful family back in blighty - in fact the vast majority of the book has been cut out and replaced with your standard cruddy love story. the ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was removed completely and our rogue was given a name (neither of these appeared until the second book).i gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. joan bennett outdoes dick van dyke in mary poppins by miles and this goes a tiny way towards saving it.ah well - brits should probably avoid this. trust me :)

we sought out this hard-to-find vhs after watching two excellent merchant-ivory pictures back to back. knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, i thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on m-i's reputation. too bad! nine years ago, it was very much a liberal agenda objective to trash the founding fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the founding fathers from many american classrooms including, for example, new jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the washington times shone the spotlight of truth into the nj school board and their subversive deed. a small part of this was headlining the alleged sally hemmings-thomas jefferson connection, disregarding the inconvenient dna findings which failed to support the wacky left's agenda. never mind! they got james ellis, an author of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and columbia university sealed the deal by giving ellis a pulitzer.as to jefferson in paris, the liberal agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein james earl jones is claiming to be the son of jefferson. the spin simply continues in flashback mode to paris. the unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to paris (as well as to the netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for america when our infant nation was without funds).besides the liberal spin job, there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie. some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in american history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia.please do not ask me why liberals set out to trash the founding fathers, because i don't waste time explaining the acts of such people. don't ask them either; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: "shut up!"

even though this film's trailer and poster imply that sally hemmings was an important character, i might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor (and i do mean minor) character if this movie was suppose to being told by sally's very own family! i mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history, would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character? his other lover (who happens to be white) as the actual love interest? i know i wouldn't! i am as pale as they come and normally a big fan of merchent~ivory flicks, but i couldn't stomach this film's treatment of poor sally hemmings.

i looked forward to spending part of my independence day weekend watching a good film about jefferson. this film was not it. it was rather long, drawn out, dull and unbalanced. too much time was spent exploring jefferson's relationship with cosway and not enough time was spent on his relationship with sally hemmings. the lady who played sally, thandie newton, was absolutely awful. her acting was so bad it was like watching an a1 airhead trying to recite shakespeare. her constant whining voice grated the nerves! nolte's accent made jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius. jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery was also underdeveloped, yet his eldest daughter's rebellion (patsy)is a key event late in the film. the film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. on the positive side, the costumes were quite beautiful, and greta scacchi played the part of cosway well. if you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and/or jefferson, then watch 1776, it's much better than jefferson in paris.

"jefferson in paris" is a truly confounding film. it presents thomas jefferson (nick nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. this is the way he was, the film seems to say. end of sentence, end of movie, the door's behind you.after arriving in paris with his daughter patsy (gwenyth paltrow), jefferson proceeds to win the heart of maria cosway (greta scacchi), the wife of a homosexual english painter (the criminally underused simon callow). a turn of events sends maria to england, however, and jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who, mere minutes of screen time before, was asking her to live with him in america.he's been bewitched, you see, by sally hemmings (thandie newton), one of his slaves just arrived from america. just why he's bewitched is hard to tell--although sally is undeniably beautiful, she acts like a simple-minded child in front of jefferson. when she isn't telling ghost stories in exaggerated "darky" speech patterns, she's slinking around his bedroom, practically oozing lust for her distinguished massa.if her behavior is an attempt to excuse jefferson's, it doesn't work. jefferson damns himself further when maria, tired of waiting for his letters, travels from england to see him. i've not changed toward you, he insists, offering weak excuses for not writing. to her credit, maria sees through his brazen lies immediately. when sally appears, and she and jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly, to my mind) in maria's very presence, the illusion falls apart completely.no one today believes that jefferson, washington and the rest were utter paragons of virtue and morality. yet, are we supposed to believe that the learned, distinguished jefferson would be attracted to sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how "massa's frenchie friends don' unnastan' aw corn" and who rubs herself against his front as she passes, right before maria's eyes?even if we let that slide, it's followed by the horrifying revelation that sally was only 15 when this affair took place (jefferson was 41). strangely, this fact comes out only toward the very end, when sally's brother james is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying jefferson's child.jefferson is equally blase when told that sally is carrying his child, and patronizingly tells her that she'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in france with her brother. but, he promises, i'll free her when i die and our children (including any more that come, jefferson says, in a chilling declaration of sally as *his*) when they reach 21. oh thank you, massa, you feel like telling the screen. big deal.the worst scene is still to come, however, involving jefferson's daughter patsy. she is already angry at him, first for breaking his vow, made to her mother on her deathbed, not to marry again. (obviously the woman wasn't just talking about matrimony.) jefferson has also refused to allow patsy to become a nun as she wishes, despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion (that seems to mean freedom to agree with him).having promised sally and her brother their freedom, jefferson calls in patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him. sally's brother blurts out the impending birth of the child, and jefferson asks, "do you swear?" paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, although she has almost nothing to say. her face nearly contorts in agonizing pain at this revelation, yet she controls her grief and whispers yes.if anything, and the filmmakers could have had something if they'd emphasized this point more, "jefferson in paris" is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century, viewed even by men like jefferson as attractive property, pleasing but without true intellect or souls. we see jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from maria, obviously telling him where to get off, but he's soon laughing away at a wild dance from sally, complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom.i don't know whether this is an accurate portrait of jefferson or not. i don't care to watch it, however, just for the sake of watching it. this jefferson is no hero or even an anti-hero. he's a selfish, lying child-molestor--and one who gets away with it--not the kind of man i want to see a movie about.

this movie would have been alright, indeed probably excellent, if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate. "into the void" is a great song, and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with ozzy osbourne. that should have been at the end of the film, or located in a special feature. the best part of concert dvds is to put them on and let the music play, but "black sabbath: the last supper" is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted. nevertheless, there are a few strengths to this film; the concert footage, when it does play, it excellent. black sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without osbourne and this film captures that well: sabbath basically rocks the fans. the fans, of course, have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live, of course, but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the dvd viewers are burdened with. shame on jeb brien and monica hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! also, shame on wyatt smith for editing the film in such a way.

i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re-released on dvd, before you purchase them. that way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down."the buddy holly story" is such a movie.i do not wish to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot, or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses, for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago, when i first began watching it.i had recorded it on the old (monaural) beta machine back in the early 1980s, and liked it so much, that it became a regularly-played favourite. the best part, to my mind, was gary busey's performance as the young buddy, and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.i looked forward to the day when i could have it in ...stereo..., and that is where the disappointment comes in.this dvd version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but i'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch, wishing for it to end.the sound is murky, bordering on the unintelligible, and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old beta tape! despite what you think of the images, or the plot, or the characters, the real draw card here is the music......and if you can't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals, or the backing harmonies, or other ambients, then there's not much left, is there? i'm going to convert my old beta version to (mono) dvd for subsequent viewings, and put this one where it belongs, out with the rubbish! "extinction is the rule, survival is the exception..."

the most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. busey's impersonation of holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear gary busey sing "maybe baby"? typically, the members of the hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (smith and stroud, respectively) instead of as people or even characters. when holly uses a string section, the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as mozart. it's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and "amadeus", about the aforementioned mozart) so worthless. some entertainment can be derived from holly's excellent styles and songs done in a b-variation.

the best part in this movie is the first one, located in sicily, i suppose. crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising. the rest of the story is quite boring. crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique, fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack, leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short. frankly, this is a real overrated movie and crialese is a real overrated director.

***possible spoilers below*** what a long and mostly uninteresting movie! who were these characters? why didn't i care about them? if i'm going to watch a movie for two hours, i'd like to care about somebody or something. we know that salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world. beyond that, though, we learned little about most of his family's hopes, fears, etc., as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.and why was lucy even in this movie? she said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were upon reaching new york. to those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman, however cultured, could not get into this country alone, i say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time. that point could have been made in five minutes, with lucy as a momentary character.more questions: why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? we heard about the brother, and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness. also, how long was the journey from italy to new york? given the conditions on the ship, it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days. (someone said something about seeing land a "week" at one point, but i think that was when they were already en route.) i needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through.the only scene i really liked was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the dock. if you choose to rent this movie, do so with remote in hand; you may want the fast forward button handy.finally, may i suggest that, with the right voice-over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside, people walking, etc.--this movie might have made an interesting public tv documentary.

being a history buff, i rented this movie because of the subject matter. the idea of the ellis island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing. unfortunately, the movie falls flat. much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long stretches. the director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing, but instead, it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie. the characters are also poorly drawn. in the end, we don't really care as much about them as we should. it's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been. i would still like to see a good movie about the american immigrant experience, but this one isn't it.

talk about being boring!i got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the galactic railroad. i expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material. boy, was i wrong.spring and chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. it's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as notgr which is something that i suggest you watch instead. leave this bore alone. if you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. do not pay top dollar.

this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen, it was horribly done it didn't flow it was very choppy, because of that many people didn't understand the movie at all. i had to watch this movie several times before i got an idea about what was happening, ok its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it, for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness, there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing, and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie.

as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles, it is no surprise that, shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles "magical mystery tour," the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie, called "head." both movies are not so much a true story with a plot (though mmt attempted to define a plot) as they are a hodge-podge of skits and snippets, interspersed with music and songs and out-takes."head" has no plot, other than the pre-fab-four trying to break free of "the box" they are in (i.e. the type-casting of being "monkees" and the surrounding commercialism) and yet, always finding themselves back in the box. most skits involve breaks in the "fourth wall" and crossing over into other, seemingly unrelated scenes. filled with anti-vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents, the film bounces around haphazardly- also to be blamed on the multiple directors.the film, like magical mystery tour, is now excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements." phooey. like mmt, it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap.like mmt, "head" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent. it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through, but it is not ironic at all that, like everything else the monkees did, this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first... even when it comes to laying an egg.

at a saturday matinee in my home town. i went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok (it's rated g). i was assaulted by loud music, strange images, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense. we left halfway through because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre. my opinion had changed--it's even worse! basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60s...and has dated badly. i got all the little in-jokes...too bad they weren't funny. the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. some people will love this. i found it frustrating...by the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen.also, all the monkees songs in this movie suck (and i do like them).for ex-hippies only...or if you're stoned. i give this a 1.

very slow, plodding movie with a confusing story line. the movie's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals. ellen barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much-younger peta wilson. not sure what this movie was about.

this contains some spoiler information, but the movie is not worth watching anyway...why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer-director damian harris is beyond me. the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques, which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them. the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all.even more over-the-top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s/m crime belong to a large, yet secret, group of s/m lesbian executives.full of bad editing and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations - including barkin's detective salary apartment. and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep. damian is a bad writer and a bad director. he tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times. furthermore, he couldn't get ellen barkin to give 110%. i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying. standouts were peta wilson, who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part. the highly under-rated character actor, marshall bell gave his absolute best as always.and since damian couldn't deliver on any level, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. most importantly, he doesn't know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical "hollywood reality" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous.save your time, money and braincells and pass this one by.

as much as i love ellen barkin (who is really underrated) i have to boo this movie. if you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho-sexual thriller or have never watched 20/20. it's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway.overall, this movie serves to turn-on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex. not a fun movie to sit through, although if you like ellen barkin it's nice to see her place a tough lady.

this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere. subplots come in and out of nowhere, the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer's motivation is unclear to say the least. maybe they could get away with this in a porn version, but here some more clarification is needed.

mercy the movie, actually starts out as a somewhat decent film, and ellen barkin does give a strong performance. but if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare. it is always hard to brink a book onto film and unfortunatley this one ends up failing...... 3 out of 10

...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. what was the motive? the details of the murders were used, but never explained. i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. there is no thread to follow. i guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.casting is very good, i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky.not much more to say, really. but i really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious.

i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies, but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing. the evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. i started fast forwarding to see how it ended. and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. the main character, played by ellen barkin, just wasn't believable at all. peta wilson acted very well in this film, but her character was way out there and there wasn't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.

the monkees "head" is one of those peculiar phenomenons i've noticed- that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings, which its creator never intended. such is the case here.the movie is a stream-of-consciousness spectacle of the monkees floating in and out of various sketches, blackouts, set pieces, etc. similar to the ones on their tv show. but while the tv show was played for laughs, this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. all in all, it's the monkees doing the same schtick, but now it's "consciousness-raising" because the laugh track is removed. there is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drones on with colored lights.the music in "head" should prove to anyone, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability. the tunes are mostly garbage; the only one that's even listenable is "porpoise song", which opens and closes the film. but the thing is, that was a gerry goffin-carole king song, and, while it's above-average for the monkees, it's below-average by goffin and king standards. it's like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul mccartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then you find out who composed it, and you realize it's a throwaway. mike nesmith's song is maybe passable, the rest is worthless. davy jones has, i guess, what the filmmakers imagined to be "the big number" in the picture, since it's the only song presented as show biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence, but it falls flat, too, just because the song isn't any good.i have to admit i always liked the monkees, so the movie is a real disappointment. sure, they were cheesy, but they were so cheerful about it.they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. but then they got ambitious. in "head", they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product, but the truth is, they wanted something more. they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. maybe not like the beatles, but something approaching that. "head" proves that they failed on all counts. 1* out of 4

this film tried, but ultimately it was a waste of talent. it tried to hard to be "sexy." i'm not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson (who will find something besides tv's "le femme nikita" worthy of her talents.) i just didn't find, even in ms. wilson's so-called near-seduction scene with mrs. barkin any real emotion, even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work. if the sexual elements of wilson's disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart (which it didn't even by an ending it didn't deserve), neither did the murder element of the plot. perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction, but i didn't feel for anyone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie doesn't work for me. if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out: 1.) the gulity pleasure of "bound" which works well in a noir setting; and 2.) the more honest, and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hell's kitchen called "all over me." it's a well-defined indie from the mid-90's that handles that coming-of-age issue with feeling, not forced sexuality. both would be a better rental than "mercy" which has next to nothing.

i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown on the bed with the "missing eyelids", as the camera pans up and away from her face, blinks! yes, blinks! i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things! of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands. very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face. too bad.

i caught this on hbo under its category of "guilty pleasures", and i would agree that i felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. one, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "so what?". however, i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times. do i feel dirty for having watched it? yes. am i sorry i watched it? no. so, there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy, even when in a poor movie. sigh!

first of all, even imdb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is very "gappy". even main characters are missing from it like buddy for example.now back to the movie. i love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. it was horrid. probably the worst movie i have ever seen. and the reason why it bothers me so much, is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.the plot line itself is good. it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting. golden brooks was a huge disappointment. i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud, fun-loving, energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends. melodramatic roles are not for her at all. she basically killed her character, rachel.i love some of the cast, like deborah cox, mel jackson and darrin dewitt henson, but even they couldn't save this catastrophic movie. of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill harper as a man, and he didn't help me get to like him more here either.golden brooks' voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie. it seemed like she whispered throughout the whole joint. the director i won't even waste board-space on, he did such a bad job. the editing, photography/camera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad. not to mention the dialogs! absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious (when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself). as i said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was seriously messed up. i would not recommend it to anyone, unless they are cinematography major and want to see a 'what not to do' example for their future work.have a great day, everyone!!!

i have been a rabid star trek fan since 1966. still am. one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. encounter at farpoint fails in its mission.superbly produced.poorly directed, written, acted. d.c. fontana really blew this one. this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned.the first half of the first season didn't fare much better.

the series does not start as it means to go on. although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. the first ever episode of star trek: the next generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and marina sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually. otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q, and some giant jellyfish. that's right.

this is a poor excuse for a movie. a film noir done by busbee berkeley? please! first, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. yechh. so what turns her from despising him to loving him? along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. it isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. it's truly painful to watch claude rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. a crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. how he ever got talked into taking this job i'll never understand. enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent film experience. it wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life.

i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new-wave.who wasn't?unfortunately, what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave.a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty. just say no, indeed. in more ways than one. including to watching this film.i couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it. it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether.

black and white satire of a madison avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks. they're headed by putney swope (arnold johnson) who is determined to change things. however he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors. that's about as original as this gets.i'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today. the jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. how is this funny?), cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. it's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. the movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. the ending comes out of nowhere. to make it worse, with the sole exception of johnson, all the acting is bad. antonio fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the arab. this gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) are amusing and there's a rare good line here and there. i heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good. skip it...unless you're in experimental 1960s films.

writer & director robert downey, sr., a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy "putney swope." downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising, but tackles black militant culture, the dynamics in hollywood's portrayal of race, the elite white power structure, and character of corruption in any power struggle. as audacious and ambitious as "putney swope" strives to be, it qualifies as a terrible film, amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity. everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. "putney swope" stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. like most marx brothers movies, the plot is thin, providing an excuse for downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible.the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. before the body has been removed, the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member, putney swope (arnold johnson), since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. swope pink slips all but one of the white executives, surrounds himself with black, pistol packing employees, and renames the firm "truth and soul advertising." swope decides to alter the face of american advertising. he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo, and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swope's militant employees. swope exploits his african-american staff, too, ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. incredibly, swope's conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swope's advertising tactics constitute "a threat to the national security." the high point of this black & white, 85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color. unfortunately, downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. the funniest part of "putney swope" involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with u.s. president mimeo in washington d.c. (pepi hermine), a marihuana-toking midget with a kissinger-like teutonic adviser (larry wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, the borman 6.

starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles, starving children and mutilated palestinians i quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary. 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done. i kept watching and many questions are raised, were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? lots of questions asked... and then dropped. no interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial.. nothing.in short: nothing new from what every swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda.

the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.it's really rather messy though. fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.the dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. there's also a very prosaic, dare i say it british feel to the filming. i didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. wilkinson and watson support this meta-essay with good performances and john warnaby's ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.i'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10
